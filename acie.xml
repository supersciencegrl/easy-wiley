         <title>Regulating Zn2+ Migration&#8208;Diffusion Behavior by Spontaneous Cascade Optimization Strategy for Long&#8208;Life and Low N/P Ratio Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is reported firstly to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. A separation&#8208;reconstruction layer is constructed on the Zn anode. The soluble components can be separated into the electrolyte for primary optimization, and the poor&#8208;soluble components are reconstructed into flower&#8208;like arrays for secondary optimization. This strategy realizes the overall improvement of Zn ion battery performance.







Abstract
Parasitic side reactions and dendrite growth on zinc anodes are formidable issues causing limited lifetime of aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, a spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is first proposed to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. Specifically, PAPE@Zn layer with separation&#8208;reconstruction properties is constructed in situ on Zn anode. In this layer, well&#8208;soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can spontaneously separation to bulk electrolyte and weaken the preferential coordination between H2O and Zn2+ to achieve primary optimization. Meanwhile, poor&#8208;soluble polymerized&#8208;4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (PACMO) is reconstructed on Zn anode as hydrophobic flower&#8208;like arrays with abundant zincophilic sites, further guiding the de&#8208;solvation and homogeneous diffusion of Zn2+ to achieve the secondary optimization. Cascade optimization effectively regulates Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior, dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode are negligible, and the stability is significantly improved. Consequently, symmetrical cells exhibit stability over 4000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). PAPE@Zn//NH4+&#8722;V2O5 full cells with a high current density of 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 maintains 72.2&#8201;% capacity retention for 12000&#8197;cycles. Even better, the full cell demonstrates excellent performance of cumulative capacity of 2.33&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at ultra&#8208;low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 0.6 and a high mass&#8208;loading (~17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The spontaneous cascade optimization strategy provides novel path to achieve high&#8208;performance and practical ZIBs.

         <title>Structurally Modulated Formation of Cyanine J&#8208;Aggregates with Sharp and Tunable Spectra for Multiplexed Optoacoustic and Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands are attained by introducing a branched structure with a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of heptamethine cyanine dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. J&#8208;aggregates with their absorption band in NIR&#8208;II region are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging on animal models.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregation brings intriguing optical and electronic properties to molecular dyes and significantly expands their applicability across diverse domains, yet the challenge for rationally designing J&#8208;aggregating dyes persists. Herein, we developed a large number of J&#8208;aggregating dyes from scratch by progressively refining structure of a common heptamethine cyanine. J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum&#8804;38&#8197;nm) are attained by introducing a branched structure featuring a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. Analysis of single crystal data of nine dyes reveals a correlation between J&#8208;aggregation propensity and molecular arrangement within crystals. Some J&#8208;aggregates are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in animals. Notably, three&#8208;color multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution is achieved, owing to the sharp and distinct absorption bands of the J&#8208;aggregates.

         <title>Bis&#8208;azopyrazole Photoswitches for Efficient Solar Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles have been developed to achieve highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight. The bis&#8208;azo motif features a coupled &#960;n system, which not only red&#8208;shifts the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band into the red region, but also reverses the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. Sunlight&#8208;induced photoswitches are conducive to advancing the development of sustainable light&#8208;responsive applications and bring significant opportunities for solar energy storage and conversion.







Abstract
Although natural sunlight is one of the most abundant and sustainable energy resources, only a fraction of its energy is currently harnessed and utilized in photoactive systems. The development of molecular photoswitches that can be directly activated by sunlight is imperative for unlocking the full potential of solar energy and addressing the growing energy demands. Herein, we designed a series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles featuring a coupled &#960;n system, resulting in a pronounced redshift in their spectral absorption, reaching up to 661&#8197;nm in the red region. By varying the amino substituents of these molecules, highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight can be achieved, with yields of up to 88.4&#8201;%. Moreover, the Z,Z&#8208;isomers have high thermal stability with half&#8208;lives from days to years at room temperature. The introduction of ortho&#8208;amino substitutions and meta&#8208;bisazo units leads to a reversal of the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. This change provides a new perspective for further tuning the visible absorption of azo&#8208;switches by utilizing the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band instead of the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* band. These results suggest that photoresponsive systems can be powered by sunlight instead of traditional artificial lights, thereby paving the way for sustainable smart materials and devices.

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Structure in Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the relationship between solvation structure and ion transportation and interphase chemistry in polymer electrolytes. By combining strong Li+&#8208;ether interactions and weak Li+&#8208;ester interactions with steric hindrance, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+). The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure makes it be compatible with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode with middle&#8208;high areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Our work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising electrolytes for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. However, traditional ether&#8208;based polymer electrolytes are limited by their low lithium&#8208;ion conductivity and narrow electrochemical window because of the well&#8208;defined and intimated Li+&#8208;oxygen binding topologies in the solvation structure. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to reduce the Li+&#8208;polymer interaction and strengthen the anion&#8208;polymer interaction by combining strong Li+&#8208;O (ether) interactions, weak Li+&#8208;O (ester) interactions with steric hindrance in polymer electrolytes. In this way, a polymer electrolyte with a high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and anion&#8208;rich solvation structure is obtained. This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells with middle&#8208;high active material areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle at 4.5&#8197;V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.

This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high-voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cells with middle-high active material areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) can stably cycle at 4.5&#8197;V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high-energy-density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion-dipole interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacially Ordered NiCoMoS Nanosheets Arrays on Hierarchical Ti3C2Tx MXene for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber&#8208;Shaped Supercapacitors with Accelerated Pseudocapacitive Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design high&#8208;performance core&#8211;shell NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Due to the fiber with fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8722; adsorption barrier, stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide, and large Faradaic capacitive energy&#8208;storage, the FSCs exhibit high capacitance, energy density, cycling stability, which power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.







Abstract
Balancing electrochemical activity and structural reversibility of fibrous electrodes with accelerated Faradaic charge transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive storage are highly crucial for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Herein, we report novel core&#8211;shell hierarchical fibers for high&#8208;performance FSCs, in which the ordered NiCoMoS nanosheets arrays are chemically anchored on Ti3C2Tx fibers. Beneficial from architecting stable polymetallic sulfide arrays and conductive networks, the NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber maintains fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8722; adsorption barrier, and stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide. Consequently, the NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits a large volumetric capacitance (2472.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and reversible cycling performance (20,000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the solid&#8208;state symmetric FSCs deliver a high energy density of 50.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and bending stability, which can significantly power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule additives with &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane, which effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes (002) facets&#8208;oriented deposition, enhancing reversibility at a high 92&#8201;% depth of discharge and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;%, resulting in low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.3 in full aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8211;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92&#8201;% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~5&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Intrinsically Decoupled Coordination Chemistries Enable Quasi&#8208;Eutectic Electrolytes with Fast Kinetics toward Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal theory of intrinsically decoupling is proposed to conquer the sluggish kinetics in eutectic electrolytes, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte that enables ZICs with high reversibility and elevated capacitance output.







Abstract
Eutectic electrolytes show potential beyond conventional low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) in zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) yet suffer from high viscosity and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we originally propose a universal theory of intrinsically decoupling to address these issues, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte (quasi&#8208;EE). Joint experimental and theoretical analyses confirm its unique solution coordination structure doped with near&#8208;LCE domains. This enables the quasi&#8208;EE well inherit the advanced properties at deep&#8208;eutectic states while provide facilitated kinetics as well as lower energy barriers via a vehicle/hopping&#8208;hybridized charge transfer mechanism. Consequently, a homogeneous electroplating pattern with much enhanced Sand's time is achieved on the Zn surface, followed by a twofold prolonged service&#8208;life with drastically reduced concentration polarization. More encouragingly, the quasi&#8208;EE also delivers increased capacitance output in ZICs, which is elevated by 12.4&#8201;%&#8211;144.6&#8201;% compared to that before decoupling. Furthermore, the pouch cell with a cathodic mass loading of 36.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maintains competitive cycling performances over 600&#8197;cycles, far exceeding other Zn&#8208;based counterparts. This work offers fresh insights into eutectic decoupling and beyond.

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Directional Growth and Density Modulation of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic adsorption synergistically modulates the density of CeO2&#8722;X particles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) ultimately enabling directional growth and localized density modulation of single&#8208;atom platinum (PtSA). Localized density control of PtSA via tuning the density of H* radicals can improve the electrocatalytic performance of all pH conditions in hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Dispersion of single atoms (SAs) in the host is important for optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to tune oxygen vacancies in CeO2&#8722;X directionally anchoring the single atom platinum (PtSA), which is uniformly dispersed on the rGO. The catalyst's performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be enhanced by controlling different densities of CeO2&#8208;X in rGO. The PtSA performs best optimally densified and loaded on homogeneous and moderately densified CeO2&#8208;X/rGO (PtSA&#8722;M&#8722;CeO2&#8722;X/rGO). It exhibited higher activity in HER with an overpotential of 25&#8197;mV at 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 33&#8197;mV at 1 KOH than that of almost reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, it exhibited stability for 90&#8197;hours at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1 KOH and &#8722;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 conditions, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the suitable dispersion density of PtSA on the defects of CeO2&#8722;X with more active sites gives the potential for practical applications. This research paves the way for developing single&#8208;atom catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and stability, holding promise in advanced green energy conversion through defects engineering.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling is achieved using gold nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres. The swelling and deswelling of these polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes enable the assembly and disassembly of the gold nanoparticles, altering their plasmonic coupling and allowing reversible color switching.







Abstract
Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Matched Polymer Ligands Toward Near&#8208;Perfect Synergistic Passivation for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Br/Cl Mixed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208;functional group spacing of polymer ligands is crucial for enhancing their interaction and passivation effects with perovskite nanocrystals. In this study, we demonstrate that alternating copolymers with a inter&#8208;functional group spacing of four carbon atoms exhibit nearly perfect matching with the ion distribution on the surface of CsPbBrxCl3&#8208;x, resulting in excellent performance and prolonged lifetime of pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emmiting diodes.







Abstract
Mixed Br/Cl perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) exhibit bright pure&#8208;blue emission benefiting for fulfilling the Rec. 2100 standard. However, phase segregation remains a significant challenge that severely affects the stability and emission spectrum of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we demonstrate the optimization of the spacing between polydentate functional groups of polymer ligands to match the surface pattern of CsPbBr1.8Cl1.2 PeNCs, resulting in effective synergistic passivation effect and significant improvements in PeLED performances. The block and alternating copolymers with different inter&#8208;functional group spacing are facilely synthesized as ligands for PeNCs. Surprisingly, block copolymers with a higher functional group density do not match PeNCs, while alternating copolymers enable efficient PeNCs with the high photoluminescence intensity, low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and high exciton binding energy. Density functional theory calculations clearly confirm the almost perfect match between alternating copolymers and PeNCs. Finally, pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are achieved with the emission at 467&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.131, 0.071), high external quantum efficiency (9.1&#8201;%) and record spectral and operational stabilities (~80&#8197;mins) in mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs. Overall, this study contributes to designing the polymer ligands and promoting the development of high&#8208;performance and stable pure&#8208;color PeLEDs towards display applications.

         <title>Poly(Dibenzothiophene&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) for High&#8208;Performance Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the introduction of dibenzothiophene into poly(aryl piperidinium) membrane, the sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks can efficiently transport the OH&#8722; ions through continuous OH&#8722; ions conducting highways, leading to significant improvement of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8722; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8722;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8722; conducting highways. Z&#8722;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8722; conductivity of 182&#177;28&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and ultralong stability of 2650&#8197;h in KOH solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#8197;V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650&#8197;h at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65&#8197;mV/h.

         <title>Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid&#8208;State Lithiation Process for High&#8208;Quality Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We clarified the relationship between precursor morphology and structural evolution of ultrahigh nickel layered cathode during solid&#8208;state lithiation. Spheroidization of precursors avoids the inhomogeneous distribution of LiOH and inhibits the preferential lithiation on particle surface, which can fundamentally solve the inhomogeneous phase transition of cathodes material. This strategy improves the cycling stability of the cathode material.







Abstract
Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense 

R3-m

 shell during the early stage of lithiation process.

     alt="Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid-State Lithiation Process for High-Quality Ultrahigh-Nickel Oxide Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clarified the relationship between precursor morphology and structural evolution of ultrahigh nickel layered cathode during solid-state lithiation. Spheroidization of precursors avoids the inhomogeneous distribution of LiOH and inhibits the preferential lithiation on particle surface, which can fundamentally solve the inhomogeneous phase transition of cathodes material. This strategy improves the cycling stability of the cathode material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid-state lithiation process. By in-depth investigation into the solid-state lithiation process of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense

 shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid-phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the range of 2.7&#8211;4.3&#8197;V) and capacity retention (89.3&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles), significantly superior to the non-spherical samples.

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetics of strand displacement by acyclic artificial nucleic acids were systematically investigated. Effects of toehold length, temperature, orthogonality, and heterochirality were determined. These data will allow rational design of novel nanotechnology devices based on artificial nucleic acids.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a Mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer Carbodicarbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand was synthesized through reaction of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. Subsequent transmetallations allow ligand transfer to different metal complexes, including RhCl(CO)2 (see graphic).







Abstract
Carbodicarbenes are strong C&#8208;donor ligands, which have found numerous applications in organometallic and main group element chemistry. Herein, we report a structurally distinct carbodicarbene ligand, which is formed by dinitrogenative coupling of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. The resulting carbonyl complex serves as a stable source for the mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand. Facile ligand transfer reactions were demonstrated to occur with gold(I), copper(I), palladium(II), and rhodium(I) complexes.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, leads to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8208;activity mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Cross&#8208;linked Oligo[2]rotaxane Networks Mediated by Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyrotaxanes (PRs) have attracted significant research attention due to their unique topological structures and high degrees of conformational freedom. Herein, we take advantage of an oligo[2]rotaxane to &#160;construct a novel class of dynamically cross&#8208;linked rotaxane network (DCRN) mediated by metal&#8208;coordination. The oligo[2]rotaxane skeleton offers several distinct advantages: In addition to retaining the merits of traditional polymer backbones, the ordered intramolecular motion of the [2]rotaxane motifs introduced dangling chains into the network, thereby enhancing the stretchability of the DCRN. Additionally, the dissociation of host&#8210;guest recognition and subsequent sliding motion, along with the breakage of metal&#8208;coordination interactions, represented an integrated energy dissipation pathway to enhance mechanical properties. Moreover, the resulting DCRN demonstrated responsiveness to multiple stimuli and displayed exceptional self&#8208;healing capabilities in a gel state. Upon exposure to PPh3, which induced network deconstruction by breaking the coordinated cross&#8208;linking points, the oligo[2]rotaxane could be recovered, showcasing good recyclability. These findings demonstrate the untapped potential of the oligo[2]rotaxane as a polymer skeleton to develop DCRN and open the door to extend their advanced applications in intelligent mechanically interlocked materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelator&#8208;Assisted Precipitation&#8208;Based Separation of the Rare Earth Elements Neodymium and Dysprosium from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare earth elements (REEs) are critical resources for many clean energy technologies, but are difficult to obtain in their elementally pure forms because of their nearly identical chemical properties. Here, an analogue of macropa, G&#8208;macropa, was synthesized and employed for an aqueous precipitation&#8208;based separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+. G&#8208;macropa maintains the same thermodynamic preference for the large REEs as macropa, but shows smaller thermodynamic stability constants. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the binding affinity differences of these chelators for Nd3+ and Dy3+ is a consequence of the presence or absence of an inner&#8208;sphere water molecule, which alters the donor strength of the macrocyclic ethers. Leveraging the small REE affinity of G&#8208;macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd3+, Dy3+, and G&#8208;macropa, the addition of HCO3&#8211; selectively precipitates Dy2(CO3)3, leaving the Nd3+&#8211;G&#8208;macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50:50 and 75:25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd3+:Dy3+ ratios of 95:5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G&#8208;macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in developing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513 nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34 nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520 nm, Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2% and 32.6%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Vaporchromic Domino Transformation and Polarized Photonic Heterojunctions of Organoplatinum Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors among different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex is assembled into highly&#8208;polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rod). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, R&#8208;rod is further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely&#8208;controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of intramolecular and intermolecular excited states is critical for the construction of these PPHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Interception and Synthetic Application of Diradical and Diene Forms of Dual&#8208;Nature Azabicyclic o&#8208;Quinodimethanes Generated by 6p&#8208;Azaelectrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6p&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4 + 2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well&#8208;defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymes in Synergy: Bacteria Specific Molecular Probe for Locoregional Imaging of Urinary Tract Infection in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared uropathogenic E. coli (UPECs) peptide fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs via the collaborative response of bacterial enzymes (OmpT and APN), enabling locoregional imaging of urinary tract infections both in vitro and in vivo, opening new avenues for timely and precise UTI diagnosis.







Abstract
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPECs) is a leading cause for urinary tract infections (UTI), accounting for 70&#8211;90&#8201;% of community or hospital&#8208;acquired bacterial infections owing to high recurrence, imprecision in diagnosis and management, and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Current methods for clinical UPECs detection still rely on labor&#8208;intensive urine cultures that impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely UTI therapeutic management. Herein, we developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UPECs fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs through its collaborative response to bacterial enzymes, enabling locoregional imaging of UTIs both in vitro and in vivo. Our NO&#8722;AH probe incorporates a dual protease activatable moiety, which first reacts with OmpT, an endopeptidase abundantly present on the outer membrane of UPECs, releasing an intermediate amino acid residue conjugated with a NIR hemicyanine fluorophore. Such liberated fragment would be subsequently recognized by aminopeptidase (APN) within the periplasm of UPECs, activating localized fluorescence for precise imaging of UTIs in complex living environments. The peculiar specificity and selectivity of NO&#8722;AH, facilitated by the collaborative action of bacterial enzymes, features a timely and accurate identification of UPECs&#8208;infected UTIs, which could overcome misdiagnosis in conventional urine tests, thus opening new avenues towards reliable UTI diagnosis and personalized antimicrobial therapy management.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a first-in-class near-infrared uropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; (UPECs) peptide fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs via the collaborative response of bacterial enzymes (OmpT and APN), enabling locoregional imaging of urinary tract infections both in vitro and in vivo, opening new avenues for timely and precise UTI diagnosis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uropathogenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (UPECs) is a leading cause for urinary tract infections (UTI), accounting for 70&#8211;90&#8201;% of community or hospital-acquired bacterial infections owing to high recurrence, imprecision in diagnosis and management, and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Current methods for clinical UPECs detection still rely on labor-intensive urine cultures that impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely UTI therapeutic management. Herein, we developed a first-in-class near-infrared (NIR) UPECs fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs through its collaborative response to bacterial enzymes, enabling locoregional imaging of UTIs both in vitro and in vivo. Our NO&#8722;AH probe incorporates a dual protease activatable moiety, which first reacts with OmpT, an endopeptidase abundantly present on the outer membrane of UPECs, releasing an intermediate amino acid residue conjugated with a NIR hemicyanine fluorophore. Such liberated fragment would be subsequently recognized by aminopeptidase (APN) within the periplasm of UPECs, activating localized fluorescence for precise imaging of UTIs in complex living environments. The peculiar specificity and selectivity of NO&#8722;AH, facilitated by the collaborative action of bacterial enzymes, features a timely and accurate identification of UPECs-infected UTIs, which could overcome misdiagnosis in conventional urine tests, thus opening new avenues towards reliable UTI diagnosis and personalized antimicrobial therapy management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization to Decipher the Essential Effects of Heteroatom Substitution on Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The moderate&#8208;concentration Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 simultaneously with suitable Se vacancies adsorbing OH&#8722; (Co(M)&#8722;Ni3Se4(VM)&#8722;OH&#8722;) presents optimal d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, substantially deciphering the effects of Co atoms substitution on the fast redox kinetics and ultrahigh rate capability of Ni3Se4 cathodes.







Abstract
The heteroatom substitution is considered as a promising strategy for boosting the redox kinetics of transition metal compounds in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) although the dissimilar metal identification and essential mechanism that dominate the kinetics remain unclear. It is presented that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal and electrolyte ions can be utilized as a descriptor for understanding the redox kinetics. Herein, a series of Co, Fe and Cu heteroatoms are respectively introduced into Ni3Se4 cathodes, among them, only the moderate Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 can hold the optimal d&#8208;p orbital hybridization resulted from the formed more unoccupied antibonding states &#960;*. It inevitably enhances the interfacial charge transfer and ensures the balanced OH&#8722; adsorption&#8208;desorption to accelerate the redox kinetics validated by the lowest reaction barrier (0.59&#8197;eV, matching well with the theoretical calculations). Coupling with the lower OH&#8722; diffusion energy barrier, the prepared cathode delivers ultrahigh rate capability (~68.7&#8201;% capacity retention even the current density increases by 200&#8197;times), and an assembled HSC also presents high energy/power density. This work establishes the principles for determining heteroatoms and deciphers the underlying effects of the heteroatom substitution on improving redox kinetics and the rate performance of battery&#8208;type electrodes from a novel perspective of orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Green Solvent &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) Facilitates Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvents can significantly influence chemical reactions in condensed phases. Their critical properties are increasingly recognized in various research domains such as organic synthesis and biomass valorization. However, in semiconductor photocatalysis, solvents are primarily viewed as mediums for dissolving and diffusing substances, with their potential beneficial effects on photocatalytic conversions often overlooked. Additionally, common photocatalysis solvents like acetonitrile (ACN) pose serious safety and environmental concerns. In this study, we demonstrate that novel and safe green solvents, such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), can significantly enhance the performance of semiconductor photocatalysis for C&#8722;H bond activation. Non&#8208;specific solvent&#8208;solute interactions are the primary contributors to increased photocatalytic activity in the self&#8208;coupling of benzylic compounds. Specifically, GVL's large dielectric constant and high refractive index lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining C&#8722;H bond activation step, facilitating a faster coupling reaction. The versatility of GVL is further demonstrated in reactions with multiple reagents and in various oxidation and reduction photocatalytic systems beyond classic C&#8722;H bond activation. This work not only pioneers the use of green solvents but also provides comprehensive insights for proper solvent selection in semiconductor photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

Coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels enable fast two&#8208;photon subtractive 3D microprinting and laser&#8208;guided cell outgrowth on demand, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;applications, such as spatiotemporal tissue engineering.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controlled two&#8208;photon photodegradation of hydrogels has gained increasing attention for high&#8208;precision subtractive tissue engineering. However, conventional photolabile hydrogels often have poor efficiency upon two&#8208;photon excitation in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and thus require high laser dosage that may compromise cell activity. As a result, high&#8208;speed two&#8208;photon hydrogel erosion in the presence of cells remains challenging. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of efficient coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels to overcome these limitations. A set of photolabile coumarin&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol linkers are synthesized through a Passerini multicomponent reaction. After mixing these linkers with thiolated hyaluronic acid, semi&#8208;synthetic photodegradable hydrogels are formed in situ via Michael addition crosslinking. The efficiency of photodegradation in these hydrogels is significantly higher than that in nitrobenzyl counterparts upon two&#8208;photon irradiation at 780&#8197;nm. A complex microfluidic network mimicking the bone microarchitecture is successfully fabricated in preformed coumarin hydrogels at high speeds of up to 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low laser dosage down to 10&#8197;mW. Further, we demonstrate fast two&#8208;photon printing of hollow microchannels inside a hydrogel to spatiotemporally direct cell migration in 3D. Collectively, these hydrogels may open new avenues for fast laser&#8208;guided tissue fabrication at high spatial resolution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite impressive advances in the construction of enantioenriched silacarbocycles featuring silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers via a selection of well&#8208;defined sila&#8208;synthons, the development of a more convenient and economic method with readily available starting materials is significantly less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first example of copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation of readily accessible methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) and primary silanes, affording an efficient and convenient route to a wide range of chiral silacyclopentanes bearing consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &#8805;98% ee, &gt; 25:1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions combine copper&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant Z/E mixture of homoallylic silanes.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Anions&#8208;in&#8208;Colloid&#8221; Hydrated Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal suffers from severe zinc dendrites, anion&#8208;related side reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and narrow electrochemical stable window (ESW). Herein, an&#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte (ACDE&#8208;3) is designed to improve the stability of zinc anode. The ACDE&#8208;3 reconfigures the hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network and regulates the solvation shell. More importantly, the hydroxyl&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;&#8208;CDs) in ACDE&#8208;3 self&#8208;assemble into micelles, in which the steric effect between&#160;the adjacent&#160;&#946;&#8208;CDs&#160;restricts the movement of anions. This unique &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; structure enables the eutectic system with a high Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+) of 0.84.&#160; Thus, ACDE&#8208;3 inhibits the formation of dendrite, prevents the anion&#8208;involved side reactions, suppresses the HER, and enlarges the ESW to 2.32 V. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell delivers a long lifespan of 900 hours at 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the Zn//Cu half cells have a high average columbic efficiency (ACE) of 97.9% at 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2&#160;with a uniform and compact zinc deposition. When matched with a poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine) cathode, the full battery with a low negative/positive capacity&#160;ratio of 2 can still cycle steadily for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8211;1.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zn metal suffers from severe zinc dendrites, anion-related side reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and narrow electrochemical stable window (ESW). Herein, an&#8220;anions-in-colloid&#8221; hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte (ACDE-3) is designed to improve the stability of zinc anode. The ACDE-3 reconfigures the hydrogen-bond (HB) network and regulates the solvation shell. More importantly, the hydroxyl-rich &#946;-cyclodextrins (&#946;-CDs) in ACDE-3 self-assemble into micelles, in which the steric effect between&#160;the adjacent&#160;&#946;-CDs&#160;restricts the movement of anions. This unique &#8220;anions-in-colloid&#8221; structure enables the eutectic system with a high Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+) of 0.84.&#160; Thus, ACDE-3 inhibits the formation of dendrite, prevents the anion-involved side reactions, suppresses the HER, and enlarges the ESW to 2.32 V. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell delivers a long lifespan of 900 hours at 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the Zn//Cu half cells have a high average columbic efficiency (ACE) of 97.9% at 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2&#160;with a uniform and compact zinc deposition. When matched with a poly(1,5-naphthalenediamine) cathode, the full battery with a low negative/positive capacity&#160;ratio of 2 can still cycle steadily for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8211;1. Additionally, this electrolyte can operative over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 &#176;C to 40 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Lithium Oxygen Batteries Enabled by Solvent&#8208;diluent Interaction in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;O2 batteries, it is imperative to develop an electrolyte with stability against the strong oxidation environments. N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) is a recognized solvent known for its robust resistance to the highly reactive reduced oxygen species, yet its application in Li&#8211;O2 batteries has been constrained due to its poor compatibility with the Li metal anode. In this study, a rationally selected hydrofluoroether diluent, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3), has been introduced into the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The stable &#8211;CH3 and C&#8211;F bonds within the M3 structure could not only augment the fundamental properties of the electrolyte but also fortify its resilience against attacks from O2&#8211; and 1O2. Additionally, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8211;F) presented in the M3 diluent could facilitate coordination with the electron&#8208;donating groups (&#8211;CH3) in the DMA solvent. This intermolecular interaction promotes more alignment of Li+&#8208;anions with a small amount of M3 addition, leading to the construction of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI that enhances the stability of the Li anode. As a result, the Li&#8211;O2 batteries with the DMA/M3 electrolyte exhibit superior cycling performance at both 30 &#176;C (359th) and &#8211;10 &#176;C (120th).</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Protein&#8208;Membrane Interactions Modulate Self&#8208;Organization of Min Protein Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;organizing protein patterns are crucial for living systems, governing important cellular processes such as polarization and division. While the field of protein self&#8208;organization has reached a point where basic pattern&#8208;forming mechanisms can be reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins, understanding how cells can dynamically switch and modulate these patterns, especially when transiently needed, remains an interesting frontier. Here, we demonstrate the efficient regulation of self&#8208;organizing protein patterns through the modulation of simple biophysical membrane parameters. Our investigation focuses on the impact of membrane affinity changes on Min protein patterns at lipid membranes composed of Escherichia coli lipids or minimal lipid compositions, and we present three major results. First, we observed the emergence of a diverse array of pattern phenotypes, ranging from waves over flower&#8208;shaped patterns to snowflake&#8208;like structures. Second, we demonstrated the dependency of these patterns on the density of protein&#8208;membrane linkers. Finally, we demonstrate that the shape of snowflake&#8208;like patterns is fine&#8208;tuned by membrane charge. Our results demonstrate the significant influence of membrane linkage as a straightforward biophysical parameter governing protein pattern formation. Our research points towards a simple yet intriguing mechanism by which cells can adeptly tune and switch protein patterns on the mesoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8208;H and O&#8208;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8208;H and O&#8208;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#949;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While the supramolecular chemistry of simple anions is ubiquitous, the targeting and exploitation of their metal&#8208;containing relatives, the metalates, is less well understood. This mini review highlights the latest advances in this emergent area by discussing the supramolecular chemistry of metalates thematically, with a focus on the exploitation of metalates in a diversity of applications, including medical imaging and therapy, environmental remediation, molecular magnetism, catalysis, perovskite materials, and metal separations. The unifying features of these systems are identified with a view to allow the supramolecular chemist to target the unique material properties of the metalates, even in areas that are currently relatively immature.</dc:description>

         <title>Toggling the Oxygen Affinity between Anthracenes and Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the design of an anthracenyl&#9135;naphthyl (ANT&#9135;NAPH) dyad and its application as a luminescent 4&#8208;stage photo switch. Both segments can individually react with singlet oxygen to switch off an optical response. In their initial form the larger ANT component reacts significantly faster and thus an ANTO2&#9135;NAPH stage is turned on, observed by optical response of the remaining NAPH. To reduce its reactivity, ANT is substituted with two pyridine rings. This concept is first investigated and quantified on ANT and NAPH as separated molecules. Upon protonation the reaction of ANT becomes significantly slower. For the three possible pyridyl isomers this effect increases along the order&#160;meta&lt;para&lt;ortho. With the pyridyl nitrogen in&#160;ortho&#160;position,&#160;the reaction completely toggles from ANT to NAPH. Application of this concept on the dyad allows to turn on the ANT&#9135;NAPHO2&#160;stage with optical response of the remaining ANT. The sequence of protonation&#8208;oxygenation&#8208;neutralization is thereby the only possible way to isolate the unfavored form ANT&#9135;NAPHO2.&#160;&#160;In the dyad ANT and NAPH are directly attached and their coupling constitutes a non&#8208;oxygenated third stage, where the NAPH luminescence is quenched and ANT luminescence is enhanced. Reaction of both NAPH and ANT to ANTO2&#9135;NAPHO2&#160;constitutes the fourth dark stage.</dc:description>

With the pyridyl nitrogen in&#160;ortho&#160;position,&#160;the reaction completely toggles from ANT to NAPH. Application of this concept on the dyad allows to turn on the ANT&#9135;NAPHO2&#160;stage with optical response of the remaining ANT. The sequence of protonation-oxygenation-neutralization is thereby the only possible way to isolate the unfavored form ANT&#9135;NAPHO2.&#160;&#160;In the dyad ANT and NAPH are directly attached and their coupling constitutes a non-oxygenated third stage, where the NAPH luminescence is quenched and ANT luminescence is enhanced. Reaction of both NAPH and ANT to ANTO2&#9135;NAPHO2&#160;constitutes the fourth dark stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Channel Emissions of Kasha and Anti&#8208;Kasha from a Single Radical Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals have recently attracted much attention due to their unique luminescence properties. However, a radical molecule with both Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha doublet emission properties has not been reported. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a stable chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabin's hydrocarbon, TTM&#8208;TTM, along with its mono&#8208;radical counterpart, TTM&#8208;HTTM. The emission of TTM&#8208;TTM follows Kasha's rule in the near infrared region. However, TTM&#8208;HTTM shows dual channel doublet emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. Remarkably, these two types of emission compete dynamically in both solution and condensed states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the rational design and discovery of stable radicals that possess distinctive luminescent properties, thus broadening the horizons of luminescent materials research.</dc:description>

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8208; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4 &#8594; [E4]&#8225; &#8594; E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4 &#8594; [E4]&#8225; &#8594; B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8208;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, it provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4 V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99%. Notably, within the flow cell, a current density exceeding 200 mA cm&#8722;2 was sustained for over 20 h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of approximately 90% and a hydrogen peroxide production rate surpassing 4 mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8208;N5&#160;Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction for Zn&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2&#160;reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5&#160;sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich&#160;in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#160;(FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99% for CO production (&#8208;0.4 V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98% at a current density of 270 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;(&#8208;1.0 V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8208;CO2&#160;battery with a cycle durability of 24 hours. In&#8208;situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites ( OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping,which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03 meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07 meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites ( OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron-hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4- octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non-overlapping,which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03 meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07 meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. DFT&#160;calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Anode&#8208;electrolyte Interphasial Reactions by Zwitterionic Binder Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with High&#8208;nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes and Silicon&#8208;Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes faces challenges due to severe structural and interphasial degradations. These challenges are exacerbated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing Si&#8208;based anodes with high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes, as significant transition&#8208;metal crossover catalyzes serious parasitic side reactions, leading to faster cell failure. While enhancing the mechanical properties of polymer binders has been acknowledged as an effective means of improving solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability on Si&#8208;based anodes, an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the binder chemistry influences the SEI is lacking. Herein, a zwitterionic binder with an ability to manipulate the chemical composition and spatial distribution of the SEI layer is designed for Si&#8208;based anodes. It is evidenced that the electrically charged microenvironment created by the zwitterionic species alters the solvation environment on the Si&#8208;based anode, featuring rich anions and weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. Such a binder&#8208;regulated solvation environment induces a thin, uniform, robust SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes, which is found to be the key to withstanding transition&#8208;metal deposition and minimizing their detrimental impact on catalyzing electrolyte decomposition and devitalizing bulk Si. As a result, albeit possessing comparable mechanical properties to those of commercial binders, the zwitterionic binder enables superior cycling performances in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs under demanding operating conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfurized Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Rechargeable Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable Mg batteries are a promising energy storage technology to overcome the limitations inherent to Li ion batteries. A critical challenge in advancing Mg batteries is the lack of suitable cathode materials. In this work, we report a cathode design that incorporates S functionality into two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (2D&#8208;MOFs). This new cathode material enables good Mg2+ storage capacity and outstanding cyclability. It was found that upon the initial Mg2+ insertion and disinsertion, there is an apparent structural transformation that crumbles the layered 2D framework, leading to amorphization. The resulting material serves as the active material to host Mg2+ through reduction and/or oxidation of S and, to a limited extent, O. The reversible nature of S and O redox chemistry was confirmed by spectroscopic characterizations and validated by density functional calculations. Importantly, during the Mg2+ insertion and disinsertion process, the 2D nature of the framework was maintained, which plays a key role in enabling the high reversibility of the MOF cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Chiral Supramolecular Assembly: The Importance of Intermolecular Electronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission originating from supramolecular chirality of organic microcrystals with a |glum| value up to 0.11. The microcrystals were prepared from highly emissive difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2dbk) dyes R&#8208;1 or S&#8208;1 with chiral binaphthol (BINOL) skeletons. R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;1 exhibit undetectable CPL signals in solution but manifest intense CPL emission in their chiral microcrystals. The chiral superstructures induced by BINOL skeletons were confirmed by XRD analysis. Spectral analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that intermolecular electronic coupling, mediated by the asymmetric stacking in the chiral superstructures, effectively alters excited&#8208;state electronic structures and facilitates electron transitions perpendicular to BF2bdk planes. The coupling increases cos&#952;&#181;,m from 0.05 (monomer) to 0.86 (tetramer) and triggers intense optical activity of BF2bdk. The results demonstrate that optical activity of chromophores within assemblies can be regulated by both orientation and extent of intermolecular electronic couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly tough slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte for stable lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93% and mechanical strength of 1.15 MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 30&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2 mAh g&#8208;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive endergonic synthesis of Diels&#8208;Alder adducts driven by chemical energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response &#8211; moving away from equilibrium &#8211; can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8208;Alder adducts accumulated in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Aluminum! The field of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) gained increased interest over the past 18&#8197;years. The majority of FLP systems consist of boron Lewis acids. This review highlights the developments in the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic application of intermolecular, intramolecular and hidden aluminum FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases.







Abstract
This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14&#8197;years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so&#8208;called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non&#8208;polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert&#8208;butyl ethylene and imines, C&#8722;F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.

         <title>Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling to Access C(sp3)&#8208;Rich gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild and highly selective decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling diborylmethylation of various alkyl carboxylic acids with a gem&#8208;diboryl metallic reagent has been accomplished via dual photoredox/copper catalysis providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176;&#8201;&#946; positions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes are highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry due to their ability to participate in multi&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling transformations, allowing for the rapid generation of molecular complexity. While progress has been made in their synthetic metholodology, the construction of &#946;&#8208;tertiary and C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes remains a synthetic challenge due to substrate limitations and steric hindrance issues. An approach is presented that utilizes synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis to achieve efficient C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, which can easily be obtained from alkyl carboxylic acids, with diborylmethyl species, providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176; &#946; positions. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to complex medicinal compounds and natural products, offering rapid access to molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;rich drug candidates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that diborylmethyl Cu(I) species participated in both the photoredox process and the key C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming step.

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Roles of Ferric Peroxide Anion Intermediates (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) in Cytochrome P450 19A1 Steroid Aromatization and a Cytochrome P450 2B4 Secosteroid Oxidation Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although most cytochrome P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations are believed to utilize perferryl oxygen (Compound I) as a reactive iron species, the ferric peroxide species (Compound 0) is thought to catalyze some oxidative deformylations. This study revealed the dominant contribution of Compound 0 in the P450 19A1&#8208;catalyzed steroid aromatization and P450 2B4&#8208;catalyzed model aromatization reactions, utilizing deuterium and 18O labeling approaches.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) 19A1 is the steroid aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the 3&#8208;step conversion of androgens (androstenedione or testosterone) to estrogens. The final step is C&#8722;C bond scission (removing the 19&#8208;oxo group as formic acid) that proceeds via a historically controversial reaction mechanism. The two competing mechanistic possibilities involve a ferric peroxide anion (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) and a perferryl oxy species (FeO3+, Compound I). One approach to discern the role of each species in the reaction is with the use of oxygen&#8208;18 labeling, i.e., from 18O2 and H218O of the reaction product formic acid. We applied this approach, using several technical improvements, to study the deformylation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione by human P450 19A1 and of a model secosteroid, 3&#8208;oxodecaline&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;10&#8208;carboxaldehyde (ODEC), by rabbit P450 2B4. Both aldehyde substrates were sensitive to non&#8208;enzymatic acid&#8208;catalyzed deformylation, yielding 19&#8208;norsteroids, and conditions were established to avoid issues with artifactual generation of formic acid. The Compound 0 reaction pathway predominated (i.e., Fe3+O2&#8722;) in both P450 19A1 oxidation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione and P450 2B4 oxidation of ODEC. The P450 19A1 results contrast with our prior conclusions (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 15016&#8211;16025), attributed to several technical modifications.

Recently, the introduction of fluorosulfonyl (&#8722;SO2F) groups have attracted considerable research interests, as this moiety could often afford enhanced activities and new functions in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) salts, which could serve as an effective photoredox&#8208;active precursor to fluorosulfamoyl radicals and enable the direct radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. This method features mild conditions, visible light, broad substrate scope, good group tolerance, etc., and a metal&#8208;free protocol is also viable by using organic photocatalysts. Further, FSAP can also be applied to the radical functionalization of alkenes via 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions, etc. In addition, a formal C&#8722;H methylamination of (hetero)arenes by combining this radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation with subsequent hydrolysis as well as product derivatization are also demonstrated.

         <title>Interfacial Ir&#8208;V Direct Metal Bonding Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Activity in Vanadium Oxides Supported Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different interfacial bonds are ingeniously constructed to explore the regulating mechanism of the interfacial environment on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where V2O3 supported Ir catalyst (Ir&#8208;V2O3) with Ir&#8208;V bonding achieves the superior activity due to the accelerated RDS by the electrons injection from V to Ir.







Abstract
Tuning the interfacial structure of metal oxide substrates is an essential strategy to induce electronic structure reconstruction of supported catalysts, which is of great importance in optimizing their catalytic activities. Herein, vanadium oxides&#8208;supported Ir catalysts (Ir&#8208;V2O3, Ir&#8208;VO2, and Ir&#8208;V2O5) with different interfacial bonding environments (Ir&#8208;V, Ir&#8208;Obri, and Ir&#8208;O, respectively) were investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The regulating mechanism of the influence of different interfacial bonding environments on HER activity was investigated by both experimental results and computational evidence. Benefiting from the unique advantages of interfacial Ir&#8208;V direct metal bonds in Ir&#8208;V2O3, including enhanced electron transfer and electron donation ability, an optimized HER performance can be obtained with lowest overpotentials of 16 and 26&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high mass activities of 11.24 and 6.66&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and turnover frequency values of 11.20 and 6.63&#8197;s&#8722;1, in acidic and alkaline conditions respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Ir&#8208;V2O3||RuO2 anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer requires only 1.92&#8197;V to achieve a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and realizes long&#8208;term stability. This study provides essential insights into the regulating mechanism of interfacial chemical bonding in electrocatalysts and offers a new pathway to design noble metal catalysts for different applications.

         <title>Unprecedented Packing Polymorphism of Oxindole: An Exploration Inspired by Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of computational predictions, along with innovative crystallization techniques for oxindole, has led to the discovery of four new forms and the reconstruction of a previously presumed &#8220;disappearing polymorph&#8221;. The findings have established a new record for the largest number of packing polymorphs for rigid organic systems, where variations are indeed due to distinct crystalline packing arrangements with the same molecular conformation.







Abstract
Crystal polymorphism, characterized by different packing arrangements of the same compound, strongly ties to the physical properties of a molecule. Determining the polymorphic landscape is complex and time&#8208;consuming, with the number of experimentally observed polymorphs varying widely from molecule to molecule. Furthermore, disappearing polymorphs, the phenomenon whereby experimentally observed forms cannot be reproduced, pose a significant challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, we focused on oxindole (OX), a small rigid molecule with four known polymorphs, including a reported disappearing form. Using crystal structure prediction (CSP), we assessed OX solid&#8208;state landscape and thermodynamic stability by comparing predicted structures with experimentally known forms. We then performed melt and solution crystallization in bulk and nanoconfinement to validate our predictions. These experiments successfully reproduced the known forms and led to the discovery of four novel polymorphs. Our approach provided insights into reconstructing disappearing polymorphs and building more comprehensive polymorph landscapes. These results also establish a new record of packing polymorphism for rigid molecules.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Prediction&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Thiophosphates as Promising Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the guidance of theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric alkali and alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates ACaPS4 have been synthesized successfully. Comprehensive characterizations indicate that the ACaPS4 family could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, considering the wide band gap, moderate birefringence, high LIDT, and phase&#8208;matching large SHG response.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of functional materials is a focus of attention in material science. As one of the most important function materials, infrared nonlinear optical materials with large second harmonic generation effects and broad optical band gap are in urgent need. In this work, directed by the theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) alkali&#8208;alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates LiCaPS4 (Ama2), NaCaPS4 (P21), KCaPS4 (Pna21), RbCaPS4 (Pna21), CsCaPS4 (Pna21) were successfully synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that ACaPS4 could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, exhibiting wide band gap (3.77&#8211;3.86&#8197;eV), moderate birefringence (0.027&#8211;0.064 at 1064&#8197;nm), high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT, ~10&#215;AGS), and suitable phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation responses (0.4&#8211;0.6&#215;AGS). Structure&#8208;properties analyses illustrate that the Ca&#8722;S bonds show non&#8208;ignorable covalent feature, and [PS4] together with [CaSn] units play dominant roles to determine the band gap and SHG response. This work indicates that Li&#8208;, Na&#8208; and K&#8208; analogs may be promising infrared nonlinear optical material candidates, and this is the first successful case of &#8220;prediction to synthesis&#8221; involving infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals in the thiophosphate system and may provide a new avenue to the design and oriented synthesis of high&#8208;performance function materials in the future.

         <title>Precisely Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Molecular Packing of Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors via Halogen Transposition for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we propose a novel halogen transposition strategy aimed at precisely regulate the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Hence, the NFREA 3TTB&#8208;ClF, featuring a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network, achieves outstanding power conversion efficiencies of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;% in binary and ternary organic photovoltaic devices, respectively, marking a new milestone in the field of NFREA&#8208;based organic solar cells.







Abstract
The structure of molecular aggregates is crucial for charge transport and photovoltaic performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) are precisely regulated through a halogen transposition strategy, resulting in a noteworthy transformation from a 2D&#8208;layered structure to a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network. Based on the 3D electron transport pathway, the binary and ternary devices deliver outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;%, respectively, marking the highest value for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Miniaturized Electrochemical Sensing Platforms for Quantitative Monitoring of Glutamate Dynamics in the Central Nervous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, and electronics. It covers various aspects including operational principles, assessment techniques, and applications as bio&#8208;integrated electronics in animal research. We also provide an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.







Abstract
Glutamate is one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters within the mammalian central nervous system. The role of glutamate in regulating neural network signaling transmission through both synaptic and extra&#8208;synaptic paths highlights the importance of the real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of its concentration and dynamics in living organisms. Progresses in multidisciplinary research have promoted the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, electronic devices, and integrated systems. This review summarizes recent works reporting various electrochemical sensor designs and their applicability as miniaturized neural probes to in vivo sensing within biological environments. We start with an overview of the role and physiological significance of glutamate, the metabolic routes, and its presence in various bodily fluids. Next, we discuss the design principles, commonly employed validation models/protocols, and successful demonstrations of multifunctional, compact, and bio&#8208;integrated devices in animal models. The final section provides an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a subsequent cyclization/oxidation process to access inherently chiral calix[4]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Both the large&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic transformation of calix[4]arene&#8208;based chiral catalysts have demonstrated their potential applications.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes are an excellent structural scaffold for enantioselective synthesis, chiral recognition, sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives via cascade enantioselective cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component reaction features a broad substrate scope (33&#8197;examples), high efficiency (up to 90&#8201;% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee on average). The potential applications of calix[4]arene derivatives are highlighted by their synthetic transformation and a detailed investigation of their photophysical and chiroptical properties.

         <title>Precise Pore Engineering of Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs. The optimized ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions, provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.







Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the separation process, but it is extremely challenging. Herein, we use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds (ethynyl and alkyne) into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne). The introduction of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds provides abundant adsorption sites within the framework while modulating the pore window size. Comprehensive characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) confirm that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne possess an isostructural framework with ZrT&#8208;1 and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;Me, respectively. Adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions. This work provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 Using a Dual&#8208;Sites Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework Coupled with Cu2O Nanoparticles via a Synergetic&#8208;Tandem Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy was developed to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst by dispersing Cu2O nanoparticles on CuPOF&#8208;Bpy@CNT comprising dual active sites for CO2 electroreduction. The synergetic interaction in dual active sites efficiently reduces CO2 to *CO with high concentration, which transferred to the nearby Cu2O sites for *CO dimerization to form *COCOH, affording an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 71&#8201;% for C2H4 production.







Abstract
Low *CO coverage on the active sites is a major hurdle in the tandem electrocatalysis, resulting in unsatisfied C2H4 production efficiencies. In this work, we developed a synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4, which was constructed via the template&#8208;directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8722;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu2O nanoparticles for further C2H4 production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FEC2H4) of 71.0&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.

         <title>Super Hydrous Solvated Structure of Chaotropic Ca2+ Contributes Superior Anti&#8208;Freezing Aqueous Electrolytes and Stabilizes the Zn anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure is proposed to solve the problem of low temperature poor performance and Zn anode instability for AZIBs. Based on the Hofmeister series, the addition of chaotropic Ca2+ forms an eight&#8208;coordination solvation, which breaks the HBs between water molecules and results in a water&#8208;poor solvation of Zn2+. Zn||PTO batteries display excellent cycling stability and rate performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB&#8208;acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation&#8208;regulated HB&#8208;acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the glass transition temperature of hybrid 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 (M) ZnCl2+4&#8197;M CaCl2 electrolyte (&#8722;113.2&#8201;&#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water&#8208;poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 1600&#8208;time stable cycling at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low&#8208;temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure is proposed to solve the problem of low temperature poor performance and Zn anode instability for AZIBs. Based on the Hofmeister series, the addition of chaotropic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; forms an eight-coordination solvation, which breaks the HBs between water molecules and results in a water-poor solvation of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Zn||PTO batteries display excellent cycling stability and rate performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)-ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB-acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation-regulated HB-acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, effectively breaking the HBs among H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, thereby reducing the glass transition temperature of hybrid 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (M) ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4&#8197;M CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte (&#8722;113.2&#8201;&#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; contributes to the water-poor solvated structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti-freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 1600-time stable cycling at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Mass Transfer Limitation within Molecular Crowding Electrolyte Reorienting (100) and (101) Texture for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous solution to prepare a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE). Under the regulation of both specific adsorption of PVP on the Zn surface and mass transfer limitation in the MCE, the Zn deposition exhibits reoriented (100) and (101) textures. Consequently, MCE enables zinc metal batteries with dendrite&#8208;free deposition and high sustainability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are emerging as a promising alternative for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, their development is hindered by the formation of Zn dendrites and side reactions. Herein, a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE40) is prepared by incorporating polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into the aqueous solutions, exhibiting an enlarged electrochemical stability window and anti&#8208;freezing properties. Notably, through electrochemical measurements and characterizations, it is discovered that the mass transfer limitation near the electrode surface within the MCE40 electrolyte inhibits the (002) facets. This leads to the crystallographic reorientation of Zn deposition to expose the (100) and (101) textures, which undergo a &#8220;nucleation&#8208;merge&#8208;growth&#8221; process to form a uniform and compact Zn deposition. Consequently, the MCE40 enables highly reversible and stable Zn plating/stripping in Zn/Cu half cells over 600&#8197;cycles and in Zn/Zn symmetric cells for over 3000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, Na0.33V2O5/Zn and &#945;&#8208;MnO2/Zn full cells display promising capacity and sustained stability over 500&#8197;cycles at room and sub&#8208;zero temperatures. This study highlights a novel electrochemical mechanism for achieving preferential Zn deposition, introducing a unique strategy for fabricating dendrite&#8208;free zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Shape Shifting and Locking in Mechanically Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials for Thermoelastic Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelastic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy=2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) undergo two phase transitions at 310&#8197;K and 380&#8197;K. When heated to 380&#8197;K, the crystals show shape shifting and expand along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4&#8201;%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5&#8201;%), and exhibits a strong actuation force. During cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreases to 305&#8197;K.







Abstract
The construction of mechanically responsive materials with reversible shape&#8208;shifting, shape&#8208;locking, and stretchability holds promise for a wide range of applications in fields such as soft robotics and flexible electronics. Here, we report novel thermoelastic one&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy=2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) to show mechanical responses. The single crystals undergo two phase transitions at 310&#8197;K and 380&#8197;K. When heated to 380&#8197;K, they show shape&#8208;shifting and expansion along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4&#8201;%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5&#8201;%), and exhibit a strong actuation force. During the cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreases to 305&#8197;K. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of chiral ions, the thermal switching shows a 10&#8208;fold second&#8208;order nonlinear switching contrast (common values typically below 3&#8208;fold). This study presents a thermoelastic actuator based on shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;locking of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for the first time. The dielectric and nonlinear optical switching properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids broaden the range of applications of mechanically responsive crystals.

         <title>XAT&#8208;Catalysis for Intramolecular Biaryl Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic, XAT mediated Smiles&#8208;Truce biaryl synthesis is described. The reaction uses mild methods to generate and chemoselectively harness capricious aryl radicals, efficiently furnishing valuable biaryl products. The reaction utilises a simple yet underexplored amide linker, which enables a challenging formal C&#8722;N arylation of anilines.







Abstract
Radical ipso&#8208;substitution offers an alternative to organometallic approaches for biaryl synthesis, but usually requires stoichiometric reagents such as tributyltin hydride. Here, we demonstrate that visible light photoredox catalysis can be used for ipso&#8208;biaryl synthesis, via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) regime. Using amide substrates that promote ipso&#8208; over unwanted ortho&#8208;addition, we demonstrate smooth biaryl formation with no constraint on the electronic character of the migrating arene ring. The photoreaction can be combined in one operation to achieve a formal arylation of the inert aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Synthesis of All&#8208;Benzene Multi&#8208;Macrocyclic Nanocarbons by Post&#8208;Functionalization of meta&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;functionalization approach of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been successfully established as a key to access topologically diverse, all&#8208;benzene multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons. Employing iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation followed by inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;C couplings, this approach enables the divergent and facile synthesis of novel all&#8208;benzene structural types including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane.







Abstract
Expanding the diversity of multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons, particularly those with all&#8208;benzene scaffolds, represents intriguing yet challenging synthetic tasks. Complementary to the existing synthetic approaches, here we report an efficient and modular post&#8208;functionalization strategy that employs iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation of the highly strained meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes (mCPPs) and an mCPP&#8208;derived catenane. Based on the functionalized macrocyclic synthons, a number of novel all&#8208;benzene topological structures including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane have been successfully prepared and characterized, thereby showcasing the synthetic utility and potential of the post&#8208;functionalization strategy.

Based on the functionalized macrocyclic synthons, a number of novel all-benzene topological structures including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane have been successfully prepared and characterized, thereby showcasing the synthetic utility and potential of the post-functionalization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrate Upcycling Mediated by Organonickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed nitrate (NO3&#8722;) upcycling technology has been developed that uses a nickel pincer complex as a bifunctional catalyst to effect sequential deoxygenation followed by C&#8722;N coupling. This approach enables nitrate salts to be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%).







Abstract
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major environmental pollutants and to neutralize this long&#8208;term environmental threat, new catalytic methods are needed. Although there are biological denitrification processes involving four different enzymatic reactions to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into dinitrogen (N2), it is unfortunately difficult to apply in industry due to the complexity of the processes. In particular, nitrate is difficult to functionalize because of its chemical stability. Thus, there is no organometallic catalysis to convert nitrate into useful chemicals. Herein, we present a nickel pincer complex that is effective as a bifunctional catalyst to stepwise deoxygenate NO3&#8722; by carbonylation and further through C&#8722;N coupling. By using this nickel catalysis, nitrate salts can be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the highly inert nitrate ion can be functionalized to produce useful chemicals by a new organonickel catalysis. Our results show that the NOx conversion and utilization (NCU) technology is a successful pathway for environmental restoration coupled with value&#8208;added chemical generation.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Short&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Excited States and Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of heterocyclic&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter is developed using the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy. The reported MR&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit deep&#8208;blue emission with narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of 13&#8197;nm. High external quantum efficiency of 27.7&#8201;% and nearly BT.2020 blue chromaticity coordinates were achieved.







Abstract
The development of deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission is of great importance for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays with wide color gamut. Herein, based on the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy for modifying the short range charge transfer excited state energies of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, we introduce one or two nitrogen atoms into the central benzene ring of a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton. This approach resulted in the stabilization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and thus systematic hypsochromic shifts and narrowing spectra. In toluene solution, two heterocyclic&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecules, Py&#8208;BN and Pm&#8208;BN, exhibit deep&#8208;blue emissions with high photoluminescence quantum yields of 93&#8201;% and 94&#8201;%, and narrow full width at half maximum of 14 and 13&#8197;nm, respectively. A deep&#8208;blue hyperfluorescent OLED based on Py&#8208;BN exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.7&#8201;% and desired color purity with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.150, 0.052). These results demonstrate the significant potential for the development of deep blue narrowband MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Highly Active Oxidation Catalysts through Confining Pd Clusters on CeO2 Nano&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis approach towards rational tailoring the threshold of cluster formation in noble metal&#8208;ceria catalysts using CeO2 islands finely distributed on Al2O3 support. The spatial separation of CeO2 entities prevents highly active Pd clusters from redispersion and strong sintering during CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
CeO2&#8208;supported noble metal clusters are attractive catalytic materials for several applications. However, their atomic dispersion under oxidizing reaction conditions often leads to catalyst deactivation. In this study, the noble metal cluster formation threshold is rationally adjusted by using a mixed CeO2&#8208;Al2O3 support. The preferential location of Pd on CeO2 islands leads to a high local surface noble metal concentration and promotes the in situ formation of small Pd clusters at a rather low noble metal loading (0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%), which are shown to be the active species for CO conversion at low temperatures. As elucidated by complementary in situ/operando techniques, the spatial separation of CeO2 islands on Al2O3 confines the mobility of Pd, preventing the full redispersion or the formation of larger noble metal particles and maintaining a high CO oxidation activity at low temperatures. In a broader perspective, this approach to more efficiently use the noble metal can be transferred to further systems and reactions in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Aggregative Luminescence from CsPbBr3 Perovskite Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbBr3 precursors show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, which originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of Lewis bases (solvent molecules) to the lead metal center. The aggregative luminescence from perovskite precursors can be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio.







Abstract
Understanding the properties of the precursor can provide deeper insight into the crystallization and nucleation mechanisms of perovskites, which is vital for the solution&#8208;process device performance. Herein, we conducted a detailed investigation into the photophysics properties of CsPbBr3 precursors in a broad concentration and various solvents. The precursor transformed from the solution state into the colloidal state and exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission character as the concentration increased. The aggregative luminescence from the precursors originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of solvent molecules to the lead metal center. Two adducts with monodentate (PbBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;solvent) and bidentate (PbBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2solvent) ligands can be obtained, accompanied by emission with photoluminescence at 610 and 565&#8197;nm, respectively. Furthermore, the aggregative luminescence intensity and color could be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio. Besides, we discussed the difference between the molecular aggregate in the organic system and the ionic aggregate in the inorganic system: the ionic aggregate is composed of solvated ions rather than individual molecules as in organic systems, which could possess properties that ions do not have. The fluorescence that is sensitive to Pb2+ coordination reported here could be applied to screen perovskite additives and judge the precursor aging.

         <title>A Radical Activation Strategy for Versatile and Stereoselective N&#8208;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and stereoselective N&#8208;glycosylation has been developed using glycosyl sulfinates under basic conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate the transformation involves a key glycosyl radical species, which can directly couple with a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical. An alternative route involving the coupling of glycosyl and iodine radicals, followed by an SN2 reaction with the resultant glycosyl iodide to give the N&#8208;glycoside, is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Previous N&#8208;glycosylation approaches have predominately involved acidic conditions, facing challenges of low stereoselectivity and limited scope. Herein, we introduce a radical activation strategy that enables versatile and stereoselective N&#8208;glycosylation using readily accessible glycosyl sulfinate donors under basic conditions and exhibits exceptional tolerance towards various N&#8208;aglycones containing alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and nucleobase functionalities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a pivotal role of iodide, which orchestrates the formation of a glycosyl radical from the glycosyl sulfinate and subsequent generation of the key intermediate, a configurationally well&#8208;defined glycosyl iodide, which is subsequently attacked by an N&#8208;aglycone in a stereospecific SN2 manner to give the desired N&#8208;glycosides. An alternative route involving the coupling of a glycosyl radical and a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical is also proposed, affording the exclusive 1,2&#8208;trans product. This novel approach promises to broaden the synthetic landscape of N&#8208;glycosides, offering a powerful tool for the construction of complex glycosidic structures under mild conditions.

     alt="A Radical Activation Strategy for Versatile and Stereoselective N-Glycosylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A versatile and stereoselective N-glycosylation has been developed using glycosyl sulfinates under basic conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate the transformation involves a key glycosyl radical species, which can directly couple with a nitrogen-centered radical. An alternative route involving the coupling of glycosyl and iodine radicals, followed by an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction with the resultant glycosyl iodide to give the N-glycoside, is also demonstrated.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Desulfurization in Air through Improved Photogenerated Carriers Separation in MOF MIL101/Carbon Dots&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 composites were designed by a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy with efficient carrier migration pathways. The Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction played a significant role in facilitating photogenerated charge transfer, enhancing substrate adsorption capability, and decreasing the activation energies of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which were crucial factors in the photocatalytic desulfurization reaction of the catalyst system. Moreover, the high concentration of photogenerated electrons and holes facilitated the production of more ROS (&#8901;O2, &#8901;OH, h+), thereby enhancing photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization.







Abstract
The extensive industrial applications of fuel oil, a critical strategic resource, are accompanied by significant environmental and health concerns due to the presence of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in its composition, which result in hazardous combustion waste. Extensive research has been conducted to develop technologies for low&#8208;vulcanization fuel production to address this issue. Consequently, the investigation of catalysts for environmentally friendly and safe photocatalytic desulfurization becomes imperative. To that end, we have designed efficient MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/CQDs@g&#8208;C3N4 (MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high carrier separation and mobility through a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy. The high concentration of photogenerated carriers facilitates the activation of oxygen and H2O2, leading to increased production of ROS (&#8901;O2&#8722;, &#8901;OH, h+), thereby enhancing the photocatalytic desulfurization (PODS). Additionally, DFT (Density functional theory) calculations were utilized to determine the electron migration pathways of the catalysts and adsorption energies of DBT (dibenzothiophene). Moreover, Gibbs free energy calculations indicated that MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 exhibited the lowest activation energy for oxygen and H2O2. The mechanism of photocatalytic desulfurization was proposed through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This study provides guidance for the development of MOF&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme systems and their practical application in desulfurization processes.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Based Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Structures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The appearance of disordered lithium dendrites and fragile solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) significantly hinder the serviceability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a multi&#8208;component covalent&#160;triazine&#160;framework with partially electronegative channels (4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) is incorporated as a protective layer to modulate the interface stability of the lithium metal batteries. Notably, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF with optimized electronic structure at the molecular level by fine&#8208;tuning the local acceptor&#8208;donor functionalities not only enhances the intermolecular interaction thereby providing larger dipole moment and improved crystallinity and mechanical stress, but also facilitates the beneficial effect of lithiophilic sites (C&#8208;F bonds, triazine cores, C=N linkages and aromatic rings) to further regulate the migration&#160;of Li+&#160;and achieve a uniform lithium deposition behavior as determined by various in&#8208;depth in/ex situ&#160;characterizations. Due to the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;component organic functionalities, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF modified full cells perform significantly better than the&#160;common two/three&#8208;component 2C&#8208;TA&#8208;CTF and 3C&#8208;TF&#8208;CTF electrodes, delivering an excellent capacity of 116.3 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;(capacity retention ratio: 86.8%) after 1000 cycles at 5 C and improved rate capability. This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axial Biaryls by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Using Engineered Imine Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryls are ubiquitous scaffolds in natural products, bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts, but biocatalytic methods for their asymmetric synthesis are limited. Here, we report a highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). This DKR approach features a transient six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;acetal bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an imine&#8208;reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to construct the axial chirality at ambient conditions. Directed evolution of an IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 provided a variant (S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11) capable of catalyzing the DKR process to access a variety of biaryl aminoalcohols in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio). Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11 variant revealed the origin of its improved activity and atroposelectivity. By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of IREDs and the power of directed evolution, our work further extends the biocatalysts' toolbox to construct challenging axially chiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals Over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8208;organic framework (PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state (ICS), prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state (ICS) prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;activated Nanocatalyst for Precise In&#8208;situ Antimicrobial Synthesis via Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excessive and prolonged use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant S. aureus strains and potential dysbacteriosis&#8208;related diseases, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Herein, we present a light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst for synthesizing in&#8208;situ antimicrobials through photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction, achieving precise, site&#8208;directed elimination of S. aureus skin infections. Methylene blue (MB), a commercially available photosensitizer, was encapsulated within the CuII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, MOF&#8208;199, and further enveloped with Pluronic F&#8208;127 to create the light&#8208;responsive nanocatalyst MB@PMOF. Upon exposure to red light, MB participates in a photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle, driven by the 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic carboxylate salts (BTC&#8722;) ligand presented in the structure of MOF&#8208;199. This light&#8208;activated MB then catalyzes the reduction of CuII to CuI through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, efficiently initiating the click reaction to form active antimicrobial agents under physiological conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the effectiveness of MB@PMOF&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis in inhibiting S. aureus, including their methicillin&#8208;resistant strains, thereby accelerating skin healing in severe bacterial infections. This study introduces a novel design paradigm for controlled, on&#8208;site drug synthesis, offering a promising alternative to realize precise treatment of bacterial infections without undesirable side effects.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H bond functionalization of arenes at the para position remains extremely challenging primarily due to its relative inaccessibility from the catalytic site. As a consequence, it is significantly restricted to the limited molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report a method for the para&#8208;C&#8211;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines using commercially available ligands under iridium catalysis. The established method displayed excellent para&#8208;selectivity for variously substituted aromatic aldimines, benzylamines and bioactive molecules. Based on the several control experiments, it has been realized that a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction between the nitrogen and boron functionality guides the para selectivity via a steric shield for the aromatic aldimines, where Bpin acts as a transient directing group. However, the steric shield of the in situ generated N&#8211;Bpin moiety controlled the overall selectivity for the para borylation of benzylamines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols.Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351 mg cm&#8208;3 at 0.01 bar through high affinity towards C2H2.

         <title>Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Silver Electrocatalysts for Selective and Stable Syngas Production from Reactive Carbon Capture Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a simple yet effect strategy to enhance CO selectivity and electrode stability using a titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayer and a chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA). This strategy is ideally suited for the direct electrolysis of reactive CO2 capture solution towards carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production.







Abstract
Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50&#8201;% at potentials more negative than &#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33&#8201;% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5&#8197;ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47&#8201;% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.

         <title>Fluorinated Dialkyl Chloronium Salts: Synthesis and Reactivity for Fluoroalkylation and Hydride Abstraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new concept for the synthesis of dialkyl chloronium cations [R&#8210;Cl&#8210;R]+ is described (R = CH3, CH2CF3), that allows the formation of fluorinated derivatives. By utilizing the xenonium salt [XeOTeF5][M(OTeF5)n] (M = Sb, n = 6; M = Al, n = 4) chlorine atoms of chloroalkanes or the deactivated chlorofluoroalkane CH2ClCF3 are oxidized and removed as ClOTeF5 leading to the isolation of the corresponding chloronium salt. Since the resulting highly electrophilic cation [Cl(CH2CF3)2]+ is able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, this compound can be utilized for the introduction of a fluorinated alkyl group to those. In addition, the fluorinated alkyl chloronium cation displays a high hydride ion affinity, enabling the activation of linear hydrocarbons by hydride abstraction even at low temperatures ultimately leading to the formation of branched carbocations.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Polymers Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self&#8208;assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named R&#8208;PBN and S&#8208;PBN, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490 nm with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 29 nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self&#8208;assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|glum|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.8%, intense CPEL activities with |gEL| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36 nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity in Oxidation of Pyrroles and Indoles Enabled by a Thianthrenium Salt Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TTSO (thianthrene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide) in conjunction with TFAA (trifluoroacetic anhydride) and Br&#248;nsted acid is able to oxidize pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones via a thianthrenium salt intermediate. In the case of 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles, the product isomer formed is that in which oxygenation has been introduced at the more sterically hindered position.







Abstract
A dearomative oxidation of pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones is described, which employs a sulfoxide as oxidant, in conjunction with a carboxylic acid anhydride and a Br&#248;nsted acid additive. 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles undergo regioselective oxidation to give the product isomer in which oxygen has been introduced at the more hindered position. Regioselectivity is rationalized by a proposed mechanism that proceeds by initial thianthrenium introduction at the less&#8208;hindered pyrrole &#945;&#8208;position, followed by distal attack of an oxygen nucleophile and subsequent elimination of thianthrene. The same reaction conditions are also able to effect a chemoselective oxidation of indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and additionally of indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones to 2&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. Here again, the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities are rationalized through the intermediacy of a thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly efficient and enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes promoted by an easily accessible cobalt&#8208;based complex was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a wide range of alkenyl groups with diversified substitution patterns as well as axial stereogenicity into enantioenriched allylic alcohols.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes with easily accessible alkenyl halides promoted by a chiral cobalt complex derived from a newly developed tridentate bisoxazolinephosphine is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis and a general approach that enable rapid construction of highly diversified enantioenriched allylic alcohols containing a 1,1&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and trisubstituted alkene as well as axial stereogenicity in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er without the need of preformation of alkenyl&#8211;metal reagents. DFT calculations revealed the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Chromium Catalyzed Asymmetric Reformatsky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Cr&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction of aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;chlorinated esters and amides has been developed, providing modular access to valuable chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
This study describes an unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction, enabling the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;&#8208;chlorinated or &#945;&#8208;brominated esters and amides. By employing a chiral chromium/diarylamine bis(oxazoline) catalyst, we achieved relatively broad functional group tolerance. Distinct from known reports, the protocol operates under both classical and photoredox conditions, facilitated by the in situ formation of a nucleophilic chiral chromium intermediate through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, identify the nucleophilic aldehyde addition as the key stereo&#8208;determining step. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of existing Reformatsky reactions but also provides a versatile strategy for accessing complex chiral molecules.

         <title>Variant&#8208;Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte without Phase Separation for Low&#8208;Temperature Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal low&#8208;temperature electrolyte with variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) structure was designed to avoid the phase separation, which endowed DIBs with long&#8208;term cycling stability, excellent discharge characteristic, and outstanding low&#8208;temperature performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low&#8208;temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual&#8208;ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation structure for universal low&#8208;temperature electrolytes (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;&#8208;LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+&#8208;solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases. Thus, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high&#8208;voltage stability of &gt;5.5&#8197;V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures. Consequently, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte enables different types of batteries to achieve excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and good rate capability at both room and low temperatures. Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7&#8201;% and 51.6&#8201;%, at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, indicating great potential for low&#8208;temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration, emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.

Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7&#8201;% and 51.6&#8201;%, at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, indicating great potential for low-temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration, emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Cu Oxide and Cu Adatoms in the Reactivity of CO2 on Cu(110)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With in situ near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the CuO/Cu(110) interface reacts with CO2 at room temperature, yielding the formation of Cu adatom&#8208;CO3 complexes. The reaction&#8208;induced surface structure resulting from CO2 exposes Cu adatoms and CuO segments as potential active sites on Cu(110), whose presence favor CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over sites on the bare Cu surface.







Abstract
We investigate the interaction of CO2 with metallic and oxidized Cu(110) surfaces using a combination of near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and theoretical calculations. While the Cu(110) and full CuO films are inert, the interface between bare Cu(110) and the CuO film is observed to react instantly with CO2 at a 10&#8197;mbar pressure. The reaction is observed to proceed from the interfacial sites of CuO/Cu(110). During reaction with CO2, the CuO/Cu(110) interface releases Cu adatoms which combine with CO3 to produce a variety of added Cu&#8722;CO3 structures, whose stability depends on the gas pressure of CO2. A main implication for the reactivity of Cu(110) is that Cu adatoms and highly undercoordinated CuO segments are created on the Cu(110) surface through the interaction with CO2, which may act as reaction&#8208;induced active sites. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, our theoretical assessment of such sites indicates that their presence may significantly promote CH3OH formation. Our study thus implies that the CuO/Cu(110) interfacial system is highly dynamic in the presence of CO2, and it suggests a possible strong importance of reaction&#8208;induced Cu and CuO sites for the surface chemistry of Cu(110) in CO2&#8208;related catalysis.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Covalent C=C/C=N Metathesis Reaction for Associative Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the C=C/C=N metathesis reaction, we have successfully incorporated tunable plasticity into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating catalyst&#8208;free and associative covalent adaptable networks with superior thermal and mechanical properties. The rapid exchange of C=C/C=N bonds significantly accelerates stress relaxation, enhancing malleability and enabling recovery under mild conditions. This plasticity also led to advanced shape memory properties with complex 3D permanent shapes.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), leveraging the dynamic exchange of covalent bonds, emerge as a promising material to address the challenge of irreversible cross&#8208;linking in thermosetting polymers. In this work, we explore the introduction of a catalyst&#8208;free and associative C=C/C=N metathesis reaction into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating CANs with superior stability, solvent resistance, and thermal/mechanical properties. By incorporating this dynamic exchange reaction, stress&#8208;relaxation is significantly accelerated compared to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;only networks, with the rate adjustable by modifying substituents in the ortho position of the dynamic double bonds. The obtained plasticity enables recycle without altering the chemical structure or mechanical properties, and is also found to be vital for achieving shape memory functions with complex spatial structures. This metathesis reaction as a new dynamic crosslinker of polymer networks has the potential to accelerate the ongoing exploration of malleable and functional thermoset polymers.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620 nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+ = (HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the bandgap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8208;H&#8230;Br and O&#8208;H&#8230;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>A chemo&#8208;selective enrichment strategy to achieve in&#8208;depth coverage of methyllysine proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteomics is a powerful method to comprehensively understand cellular posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Due to low abundance, tryptic peptides with PTMs are usually enriched for enhanced coverage by LC&#8208;MS/MS. Affinity chromatography for phosphoproteomes by metal&#8208;oxide and pan&#8208;specific antibodies for lysine acetylome allow identification of tens of thousands of modification sites. Lysine methylation is a significant PTM, however, only hundreds of methylation sites were identified from available approaches. Here we report an aryl diazonium&#8208;based chemoselective strategy that enables enrichment of monomethyllysine (Kme1) peptides via covalent bond with extraordinary sensitivity. We identified more than ten thousand Kme1 peptides from diverse cell lines and mouse tissues, that implied wide lysine methylation impact on cellular processes. In addition, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments. And therefore, this method paves a way to broad application in lysine methylation research and new biology discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226 mAh g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dyotropic Rearrangement of an Iron&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand exchange processes at metal complexes underpin their reactivity and catalytic applications. While mechanisms of ligand exchange at single site complexes are well established, occurring through textbook associative, dissociative and interchange mechanisms, those involving heterometallic complexes are less well developed. Here we report the reactions of a well&#8208;defined Fe&#8211;Al hydride complex with exogeneous ligands (CO and CNR, R = Me, tBu, Xyl = 2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3). Based on DFT calculations we suggest that these reactions occur through a dyotropic rearrangement, this involves initial coordination of the exogenous ligand at Al followed by migration to Fe, with simultaneous migration of a hydride ligand from Fe to Al. Such processes are rare for heterometallic complexes. We study the bonding and mechanism of the dyotropic rearrangement through in&#8208;depth computational analysis (NBO, IBOs, CLMO analysis, QTAIM, NCIplot, IMGH), shedding new light on how the electronic structure of the heterometallic core responds to the migration of ligands between metal sites. The dyotropic rearrangement fundamentally changes the nature of the hydride ligands, exposing new nucleophilic reactivity as evidenced by insertion reactions with CO2, isocyanates, as well as isocyanides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8211; (tBu = tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Superoxide Dismutase Catalytic Activity Of Simple Peptide&#8208;Based Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the most active synthetic Ni superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) mimic reported to date. Reactive oxygen species are aggressive compounds, which concentrations are tightly regulated in vivo. Among them, the superoxide anion, O2&#11825;&#8208;, is controlled by superoxide dismutases. Capitalizing on the versatility of the Amino&#8208;Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) peptide motif, we introduced positive charges around the NiII center to favor the interaction with the superoxide radical anion. At physiological pH, the pentapeptide H&#8208;Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Cys&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;NH2 coordinates NiII after the deprotonation of one thiol, two amides, and either the second thiol or the N&#8208;terminal ammonium, leading to an equilibrium between the two N3S1 and N2S2 coordination modes. Under catalytic conditions, a kcat value of 8.6(4) x 106 L.mol&#8208;1.s&#8208;1 was measured. Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O2&#11825;&#8208; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C&#8208;terminus to increase the global charge of the NiII complex from +1 to + 2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Thianthrenation of Aryl and Heteroaryl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given that (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids are inexpensive materials available in a great variety from commercial and natural resources or synthesis, the strategies enabling their use as starting materials for preparing fine chemicals are highly sought after. Here we report a photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;mediated protocol converting (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, high value&#8208;added building blocks that can undergo various subsequent transformations, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these ubiquitous starting materials. The excellent compatibility of the method is shown by preparing a broad range of sterically and electronically varied (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, including derivatives of pharmaceuticals, such as ataluren, celecoxib, flavoxate, probenecid, repaglinide, and tamibarotene. The syntheses of 13C&#8208;labeled probenecid and bioisosteres of ataluren as well as the unconventional modifications of celecoxib and flavoxate, illustrate the synthetic potential of the strategy. Mechanistic studies are in line with a reaction occurring through a photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) of Cu(II)&#8208;arylcarboxylates, enabling radical decarboxylative carbometallation to form arylcopper(II) intermediates that in turn react with thianthrene to form the product. Noteworthy, the susceptibility of aryl thianthrenium salts to photodegradation is overcome by a Cu(I)&#8208;driven salvage loop, which continuously intercepts the transiently formed radicals and regenerates the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Benign and Selective Amination of Lignins towards Aromatic Biobased Building Blocks with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin is a widely available second&#8208;generation biopolymer and the main potential source of renewable aromatic building blocks. Lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential in applications based on chemical and materials sciences. However, common aminations techniques for lignin usually involve toxic chemicals and generate hindered and low reactivity amines.
In this study, we developed two new, simple, and benign 2&#8208;step methodologies for the elaboration of lignin&#8208;based polyamines from different technical lignins (kraft, soda and organosolv) with a selectivity towards reactive primary amines. These methods involve grafting amide groups onto lignin followed by a hydrolysis step. Non&#8208;toxic heterocyclic compounds N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline were used as amidation agents. Hydrolysis was performed in acetone&#8208;water mixtures. Reactions were studied on model compounds and optimized on lignins. Aminated lignins were fully characterized and primary amines were quantified using quantitative 19F NMR.
Our methods generated aminated lignins with low apparent molar masses and high solubility in water and solvents. Nitrogen contents of the products ranged between 2.0 and 3.5 mmol/g with reactive primary amines counts up to 1.7 mmol/g. These soluble and reactive lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential as a replacement for fossil&#8208;based polyamines in e.g., the synthesis of aromatic polymer materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Mitochondrial Guanine Quadruplexes for Photoactivatable Chemotherapy in Normoxic and Hypoxic Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first example of a mitochondrial G&#8208;quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti&#8208;G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405 nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5 J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type II singlet oxygen and Type III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions from live cell imaging and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A first example of a mitochondrial G-quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru-TAP-PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru-TAP-PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti-G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru-TAP-PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405 nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &amp;gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5 J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type II singlet oxygen and Type III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions from live cell imaging and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650 &#8211; 950 nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 1000 &#8211; 1700 nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered&#160;three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission ranging from 1100 &#8211; 1550 nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next&#8208;generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8208;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8208;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8208;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8208;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8 at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Production of 2D Non&#8208;Layered Metal Oxides through Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Rapid Redox Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonlayered metal compounds with porous structure show broad application prospects in electrochemistry&#8208;related fields due to their abundant active sites, open ions/electrons diffusion channels, and faradaic reactions. However, scalable and universal synthesis of 2D porous compounds still remains challenging. Here, inspired by blowing gum, a metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) rapid redox transformation (MRRT) strategy is proposed for the mass production of a wide variety of 2D porous metal oxides. Adequate crosslinking degree of MOG precursor and its rapid redox with NO3&#8208; are critical for generating gas pressure from interior to exterior, thus blowing the MOG into 2D carbon nanosheets, which further act as self&#8208;sacrifice template for formation of oxides with porous and ultrathin structure. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by the fabrication of 39 metal oxides, including 10 transition metal oxides, one II&#8208;main group oxide, two III&#8208;main group oxides, 22 perovskite oxides, four high&#8208;entropy oxides. As an illustrative verification, the 2D transition metal oxides exhibit excellent capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. Moreover, the assembled CDI cell could act as desalting battery to supply electrical energy during electrode regeneration. This MRRT strategy offers opportunities for achieving universal synthesis of 2D porous oxides with nonlayered structures and studying their electrochemistry&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shear&#8208;strained Pd Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8208;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8208;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield&#160;of 4.2 mol.gcat&#8208;1. h&#8208;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Formation Cycling Enabling LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase is highly desirable for wide&#8208;temperature battery, but its application is hindered by the unwanted side reactions associated with conventional method of introducing fluorinated additives. Here, we developed an additive&#8208;free strategy to produce LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) by low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Using LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 as a model cathode, the atomic ratio of LiF in the CEI formed at &#8208;5 &#176;C is about 17.7%, enhanced by ~550% compared to CEI formed at 25 &#176;C (2.7%). The underlying mechanism is uncovered by both experiments and theoretic simulation, indicating that the decomposition of LiPF6 to LiF is transformed into spontaneous and exothermic on positively charged cathode surface and lowering the temperature shift chemical equilibrium towards the formation of LiF&#8208;rich CEI. Superior to conventional fluorinated additives, this approach is free from unwanted side reactions, imparting batteries with both high&#8208;temperature (60 oC) cyclability and low&#8208;temperature rate performance (capacity enhanced by 100% at 3 C at &#8208;20 oC). This low&#8208;temperature formation cycling to construct LiF&#8208;rich CEI is extended to various cathode systems, such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, demonstrating the versatility and potential impact of our strategy in advancing the performance and stability of wide&#8208;temperature batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

It remains great challenges in assembling cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) included complexes to induce supramolecular chirality ascribed to the excellent water solubility and flexible packing. Herein, we unveiled the structural basis on the formation of chiroptical coassemblies from CB[n] (n = 6, 7) complexes. Perylene diimides (PDIs) with cationic chiral pendants formed complexes in the aqueous media, which selectively showed chiroptical properties. Chlorination at the bay position, increasing alkyl length of cationic chiral pendants or reducing the number of polyaromatic rings would hinder the chiral aggregation. In a comprehensive manner, CB[6] favors ordered aggregation into one&#8208;dimensional fibrous nanoarchitectures that greatly facilitates the supramolecular chirality. In contrast, CB[7] with larger cavity and water solubility shrinks the ordered arrangement of complexes, reducing the formation possibility of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectures. This work suggests the great potential of CB[6] in the preparation and manipulation of supramolecular chiral assemblies, shedding light on the macrocycle&#8208;based functional chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unbiased photoelectrochemical H2O2 coupled to H2 production via dual Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes with ultralow onset potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. The formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an average FE of 85% in the potential range of 0.4&#8208;1.6 VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 at 1.6 VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8208;0.55 VRHE with 80.4% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both&#160;Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3&#160;photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3&#160;photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 without applying any addition bias. This is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Molecular Mimetic Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct construction of metal&#8208;free catalysts on conductive substrates for electrocatalytic organic hydrogenation reactions is significant but still unexplored. Here, learning from the homogeneous molecular catalysts, an organic molecular mimetic metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8210;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8211;COOH&#8208; and &#8211;OH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72% Faradaic efficiency, 99% selectivity and 96% yield of the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. The removal of these oxygen&#8208;containing groups leads to negligible activity. The experimental and calculation results reveal that the origin of the high activity can be assigned to the &#8211;COOH and &#8211;OH groups on graphite. A flow electrolytic cell delivers ten grams of hydrogenated products with 81% Faradaic efficiency. This metal&#8208;free catalyst is also suitable for gas&#8208;phase acetylene semihydrogenation and other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially,&#160;N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into&#160;N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides,&#160;represented by&#160;cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3&#160;and Cs3Cu2I5),&#160;are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct bandgap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all&#160;ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8208;X (X =&#160;Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2&#160;(DFPD+&#160;= 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits&#160;unique 2D layered crystal structure.&#160;Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2&#160;crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective borylation of specific C&#8208;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone.&#160;This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8208;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with "side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall" substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8208;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Rechargeable LiFePO4/Graphite Batteries from &#8722;80&#176;C to 80&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial Li&#8208;ion transport. Here we report a wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range ester&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast-charging capability and low-temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial Li-ion transport. Here we report a wide-temperature-range ester-based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film-forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt. The interfacial barrier of the battery is quantitatively unraveled by employing three-electrode system and distribution of relaxation time technique. The superior role of the proposed electrolyte in preventing Li0 plating and sustaining homogeneous and stable interphases are also systematically investigated. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit rechargeability in an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;80&#176;C to 80&#176;C and outstanding fast-charging capability without compromising lifespan. Specially, the practical LFP/graphite pouch cells achieve 80.2% capacity retention after 1200 cycles (2 C) and 10-min charge to 89% (5 C) at 25&#176;C and provides reliable power even at &#8722;80&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium Nanoclusters and Single Atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Achieves Low&#8208;Input/Input&#8208;Free Hydrogen Evolution via Decoupled/Coupled Hydrazine Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic activation of the bifunctional reaction kinetics of cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles decorated&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon by the concomitant Ru nanoclusters and single atom enables the efficient coupling or decoupling of hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction for the multifold H2 production via the zinc hydrazine battery&#8208;driven overall hydrazine splitting system.







Abstract
The hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 evolution method promises low&#8208;input and input&#8208;free hydrogen production. However, developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) is challenging. Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles&#8208;decorated N&#8208;doped carbon (&#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring &#8722;80&#8197;mV and &#8722;9&#8197;mV respectively to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H ad/desorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at just 64&#8197;mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn&#8722;Hz) battery assembled with &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 97.3&#8201;% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn&#8722;Hz with OHzS system enables self&#8208;powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell&#8208;integrated&#8208;electrolyzer system.

         <title>Paper&#8208;in&#8208;Tip Bipolar Electrospray Mass Spectrometry for Real&#8208;Time Chemical Reaction Monitoring</title>

We present the first combination of a paper&#8208;based bipolar electrode with mass spectrometry to address the need not only to capture ultrafast dynamics in chemistry, but also to access complementary structural information from diverse reaction scenarios and to explore electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Capturing short&#8208;lived intermediates at the molecular level is key to understanding the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions. Here, we have developed a paper&#8208;in&#8208;tip bipolar electrolytic electrospray mass spectrometry platform, in which a piece of triangular conductive paper incorporated into a plastic pipette tip serves not only as an electrospray emitter but also as a bipolar electrode (BPE), thus triggering both electrospray and electrolysis simultaneously upon application of a high voltage. The bipolar electrolysis induces a pair of redox reactions on both sides of BPE, enabling both electro&#8208;oxidation and electro&#8208;reduction processes regardless of the positive or negative ion mode, thus facilitating access to complementary structural information for mechanism elucidation. Our method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of transient intermediates (such as N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline radical cation, dopamine o&#8208;quinone (DAQ) and sulfenic acid with half&#8208;lives ranging from microseconds to minutes) and transient processes (such as DAQ cyclization with a rate constant of 0.15&#8197;s&#8722;1). This platform also provides key insights into electrocatalytic reactions such as Fe (III)&#8208;catalyzed dopamine oxidation to quinone species at physiological pH for neuromelanin formation.

         <title>Zwitterionic Cellulose&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by Aqueous Solution Casting for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;ZCNF) is synthesized by integrating zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) into PEO matrix mixed with LiTFSI, using a straightforward and eco&#8208;friendly aqueous solution casting method. Due to the unique zwitterionic properties, PL&#8208;ZCNF enables an optimized balance between Li ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as the resultant extraordinary long&#8208;term cyclability in full and punch cells.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries hold great promise as the next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, PEO&#8208;based electrolytes encounter certain limitations, including inferior ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number, and poor mechanical strength. Herein, we aim to simultaneously address these issues by utilizing one&#8208;dimensional zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) as fillers for PEO&#8208;based electrolytes using a simple aqueous solution casting method. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the unique zwitterionic structure imparts ZCNF with various functions, such as disrupting PEO crystallization, dissociating lithium salts, anchoring anions through cationic groups, accelerating Li+ migration by anionic groups, as well as its inherent reinforcement effect. As a result, the prepared PL&#8208;ZCNF electrolyte exhibits remarkable ionic conductivity (5.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) at 60&#8201;&#176;C without sacrificing mechanical strength (9.2&#8197;MPa), together with high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Attributed to these merits of PL&#8208;ZCNF, the LiFePO4|PL&#8208;ZCNF|Li solid&#8208;state full&#8208;cell delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling performance (900&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Notably, the assembled pouch&#8208;cell can maintain steady operation over 1000&#8197;cycles with an impressive 93.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 0.5&#8197;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the great potential of PL&#8208;ZCNF for practical applications.

         <title>Reverse Separation of Carbon Dioxide and Acetylene in Two Isostructural Copper Pyridine&#8208;Carboxylate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Different pore structures can adjust binding configurations of CO2 and C2H2 molecules in two isoreticular ultramicroporous MOFs to show selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 for efficient purification of C2H2.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar molecular shapes and physical properties. Adsorptive separation of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but is hardly realized because of relatively polarizable acetylene binds more strongly. Here, we reverse the CO2 and C2H2 separation by adjusting the pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Under ambient conditions, copper isonicotinate (Cu(ina)2), with relatively large pore channels shows C2H2&#8208;selective adsorption with a C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 3.4, whereas its smaller&#8208;pore analogue, copper quinoline&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate (Cu(Qc)2) shows an inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 5.6. Cu(Qc)2 shows compact pore space that well matches the optimal orientation of CO2 but is not compatible for C2H2. Neutron powder diffraction experiments confirmed that CO2 molecules adopt preferential orientation along the pore channels during adsorption binding, whereas C2H2 molecules bind in an opposite fashion with distorted configurations due to their opposite quadrupole moments.

&lt;p&gt;Different pore structures can adjust binding configurations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in two isoreticular ultramicroporous MOFs to show selective adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for efficient purification of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar molecular shapes and physical properties. Adsorptive separation of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but is hardly realized because of relatively polarizable acetylene binds more strongly. Here, we reverse the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation by adjusting the pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Under ambient conditions, copper isonicotinate (&lt;b&gt;Cu(ina)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), with relatively large pore channels shows C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorption with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 3.4, whereas its smaller-pore analogue, copper quinoline-5-carboxylate (&lt;b&gt;Cu(Qc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) shows an inverse CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 5.6. &lt;b&gt;Cu(Qc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; shows compact pore space that well matches the optimal orientation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but is not compatible for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Neutron powder diffraction experiments confirmed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules adopt preferential orientation along the pore channels during adsorption binding, whereas C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules bind in an opposite fashion with distorted configurations due to their opposite quadrupole moments. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of &lt;b&gt;Cu(Qc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Preparation, and Implementation of Axially Chiral Benzotetramisoles as Lewis Base Catalysts for Asymmetric Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTMs) that have both central and axial chirality were developed. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts were tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions, giving cycloaddition products with high stereoselectivities that are otherwise difficult to achieve with conventional BTM catalysts. Control experiments indicated that the axial and central chirality played a synergistic role in controlling the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Developing novel catalysts with potent activity is of great importance in organocatalysis. In this study, we designed and prepared a new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTM) that have both central and axial chirality. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts was tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions. These included the AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (2+2) cycloaddition between &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl anhydride with imines or oxindoles, and the sequential gold/AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (4+2) cycloaddition of enynamides with pentafluorophenyl esters. The interplay between axial and central chirality had a collaborative effect in regulating the stereochemistry in these cycloadditions, leading to high levels of stereoselectivity that would otherwise be challenging to achieve using conventional BTM catalysts. However, the (2+2) and (4+2) cycloadditions have different predilections for axial and central chirality combinations.

         <title>2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong ionic/covalent bonding usually requires more aggressive pathways for effective exfoliation purposes. Here, we propose for the first time a radical/strain synergistic strategy for exfoliation of non&#8208;van der Waals interacting pseudolamellar phosphate frameworks. Innovative 2D layered NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystals exfoliated via &#8208;OH/H2O synergism exhibit significantly improved Na&#8208;storage properties compared to bulk frameworks.







Abstract
2D compounds exfoliated from weakly bonded bulk materials with van der Waals (vdW) interaction are easily accessible. However, the strong internal ionic/covalent bonding of most inorganic crystal frameworks greatly hinders 2D material exfoliation. Herein, we first proposed a radical/strain&#8208;synergistic strategy to exfoliate non&#8208;vdW interacting pseudo&#8208;layered phosphate framework. Specifically, hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) distort the covalent bond irreversibly, meanwhile, H2O molecules as solvents, further accelerating interlayered ionic bond breakage but mechanical expansion. The innovative 2D laminar NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystal, exfoliated by &#8901;OH/H2O synergistic strategy, exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity, high&#8208;rate performance (85.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C), cyclic life (2300 cycles), and ion migration rates, compared with the bulk framework. Importantly, this chemical/physical dual driving technique realized the effective exfoliation for strongly coupled pseudo&#8208;layered frameworks, which accelerates 2D functional material development.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure Enables Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte in High&#8208;Voltage Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure is realized in the co&#8208;solvent ether&#8208;based electrolyte at a medium concentration of 1.5&#8197;M. The introduction of weakly solvated DBE cosolvent greatly weakens the K+&#8208;solvent coordination, reducing the K+ desolvation energy. Furthermore, more anions occupy the inner solvation sheath, which enhances the oxidative stability and facilitates the formation of robust and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. These assure the ultrahigh compatibility with K metal anode and excellent electrochemical performance at high voltage.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;dominated solvation are promising candidates to achieve dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;voltage potassium metal batteries. However, it's challenging to form anion&#8208;reinforced solvates at low salt concentrations. Herein, we construct an anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure at a moderate concentration of 1.5&#8197;M with weakly coordinated cosolvent ethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The unique solvation structure accelerates the desolvation of K+, strengthens the oxidative stability to 4.94&#8197;V and facilitates the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. These enable stable plating/stripping of K metal anode over 2200&#8197;h, high capacity retention of 83.0&#8201;% after 150 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V in K0.67MnO2//K cells, and even 91.5&#8201;% after 30 cycles under 4.7&#8197;V. This work provides insight into weakly coordinated cosolvent and opens new avenues for designing ether&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage electrolytes.

         <title>Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce an alternative to the use of open metal vacancies in the design of amine&#8208;appended adsorbents based on the use of secondary building units combining of hard and soft metal sites. This endows MUV&#8208;10 with a flexible response to the uptake of tetraamines that facilitates their translocation into the microporous cavities of the framework to form stable bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that can remain stable in water.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can be grafted with amines by coordination to metal vacancies to create amine&#8208;appended solid adsorbents, which are being considered as an alternative to using aqueous amine solutions for CO2 capture. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism that does not rely on the use of neutral metal vacancies as binding sites but is enabled by the structural adaptability of heterobimetallic Ti2Ca2 clusters. The combination of hard (Ti4+) and soft (Ca2+) metal centers in the inorganic nodes of the framework enables MUV&#8208;10 to adapt its pore windows to the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules. This dynamic cluster response facilitates the translocation and binding of tetraamine inside the microporous cavities to enable the formation of bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that are stable in water. The extension of this grafting concept from MUV&#8208;10 to larger cavities not restrictive to CO2 diffusion will complement other strategies available for the design of molecular sorbents for decarbonization applications.

     alt="Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce an alternative to the use of open metal vacancies in the design of amine-appended adsorbents based on the use of secondary building units combining of hard and soft metal sites. This endows MUV-10 with a flexible response to the uptake of tetraamines that facilitates their translocation into the microporous cavities of the framework to form stable bis-coordinate adducts that can remain stable in water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-Organic Frameworks can be grafted with amines by coordination to metal vacancies to create amine-appended solid adsorbents, which are being considered as an alternative to using aqueous amine solutions for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism that does not rely on the use of neutral metal vacancies as binding sites but is enabled by the structural adaptability of heterobimetallic Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters. The combination of hard (Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;) and soft (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) metal centers in the inorganic nodes of the framework enables MUV-10 to adapt its pore windows to the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules. This dynamic cluster response facilitates the translocation and binding of tetraamine inside the microporous cavities to enable the formation of bis-coordinate adducts that are stable in water. The extension of this grafting concept from MUV-10 to larger cavities not restrictive to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusion will complement other strategies available for the design of molecular sorbents for decarbonization applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Particle&#8208;Carbon/Binder Degradation Behavior in Fatigued Layered Cathode Materials through Machine Learning Aided Diffraction Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique combination of machine learning and &#956;&#8208;XRD CT has been used to unveil the spatial distribution of structure and microstrain in the fatigued layered materials. Smaller NCM622 particles and the surface of larger NCM622 particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Serious structural fatigue occurs in both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles during extended cycling.







Abstract
Understanding how reaction heterogeneity impacts cathode materials during Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrochemical cycling is pivotal for unraveling their electrochemical performance. Yet, experimentally verifying these reactions has proven to be a challenge. To address this, we employed scanning &#956;&#8208;XRD computed tomography to scrutinize Ni&#8208;rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) and Li&#8208;rich layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 (LLNMO). By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, we scrutinized an extensive dataset of &#956;&#8208;XRD patterns, about 100,000&#8197;patterns per slice, to unveil the spatial distribution of crystalline structure and microstrain. Our experimental findings unequivocally reveal the distinct behavior of these materials. NCM622 exhibits structural degradation and lattice strain intricately linked to the size of secondary particles. Smaller particles and the surface of larger particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Conversely, both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles endure severe strain&#8208;induced structural degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling, resulting in significant voltage decay and capacity fade. This work holds the potential to fine&#8208;tune the microstructure of advanced layered materials and manipulate composite electrode construction in order to enhance the performance of LIBs and beyond.

         <title>Mechanical Strain Induces and Increases Vesicular Release Monitored by Microfabricated Stretchable Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of stretchable microelectrodes and achieved real&#8208;time quantifying of strain&#8208;induced catecholamine release from single vesicles. The results proved that mechanical strain could trigger the exocytotic events by activating Piezo1 channel and increase catecholamine release by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closure of fusion pores.







Abstract
Exocytosis involving the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membrane, is thought to be modulated by the mechanical cues in the microenvironment. Single&#8208;cell electrochemistry can offer unique information about the quantification and kinetics of exocytotic events; however, the effects of mechanical force on vesicular release have been poorly explored. Herein, we developed a stretchable microelectrode with excellent electrochemical stability under mechanical deformation by microfabrication of functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive ink, which achieved real&#8208;time quantitation of strain&#8208;induced vesicular exocytosis from a single cell for the first time. We found that mechanical strain could cause calcium influx via the activation of Piezo1 channels in chromaffin cell, initiating the vesicular exocytosis process. Interestingly, mechanical strain increases the amount of catecholamines released by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closing of fusion pore during exocytosis. This work is expected to provide revealing insights into the regulatory effects of mechanical stimuli on vesicular exocytosis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct ortho&#8208;Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with (hetero)aryl halides based on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity. The catalytic cycle was elucidated by DFT and supporting experiments.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with aryl iodides relying on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. Its scope and functional group compatibility were both found to be quite broad as a large variety of both aminophosphines and (hetero)aryl iodides, including complex ones, could be utilized. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high average yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity, which constitutes a major step forward compared to other processes. The reaction is moreover not limited to aryl iodides, as an aryl bromide and a triflate could be successfully used, and could be extended to diarylation. Mechanistic studies revealed the key and unique role of the aminophosphine, acting not only as a substrate but also as a ligand for the rhodium catalyst.

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>

         <dc:description>
By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring, and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyethers through epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.







Abstract
Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclization was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization of polyepoxide.

We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide-to-epoxonium ring-opening cyclization of polyepoxide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkyl Chains Tune Molecular Orientations to Enable Dual Passivation in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientation, enhancing its interaction with surface defects. Consequently, this led to the successful fabrication of a stable inverted device with an impressive PCE of 25&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nonradiative recombination losses occurring at the interface pose a significant obstacle to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in inverted PSCs. Passivating surface defects using molecules with different functional groups represents one of the key strategies for enhancing PSCs efficiency. However, a lack of insight into the passivation orientation of molecules on the surface is a challenge for rational molecular design. In this study, aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains but identical electron&#8208;donating (&#8722;SH) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8722;NH3+) groups were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientations, which facilitating stronger interactions with the surface defects through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding. The resultant perovskite films following defect passivation demonstrate reduced ion migration, inhibition of nonradiative recombination, and more n&#8208;type characteristics for efficient electron transfer. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% was achieved, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 500&#8197;hours of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cyclotrimerization: A Versatile Tool to Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Stacking Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents, for the first time, the mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles. Utilizing Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and a ball mill, both small molecules and large organic frameworks could be obtained. Screening the reaction of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene by various parameters, such as reaction time, frequency, or temperature, significant impacts on the porosity of the polymer and its crystallinity were revealed.







Abstract
We introduce the first mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles, a facile strategy for synthesizing triazine&#8208;containing molecules and materials, overcoming challenges related to carbonization and solubility. Conducting this solid&#8208;state approach in a mixer ball mill with 4&#8208;Methylbenzonitrile, we synthesize Tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine quantitatively in as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Just as fast, this mechanochemical method facilitates the synthesis of the covalent triazine framework CTF&#8208;1 using 1,4&#8197;Dicyanobenzene. Material characterization confirms its porous (650&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs &#8208; from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.

         <title>Indium Tin Oxide Induced Internal Positive Feedback and Indium Ion Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

The interaction between perovskite decomposition products and indium tin oxide substrate triggers positive feedback cycle and deteriorates the stability of perovskite solar cell.







Abstract
Stability is the most pressing challenge hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and previous efforts focused more on enhancing the resistance of PSCs to external stimulus. Here, we found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) will deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through positive feedback cycles. Specifically, the perovskite degradation products will cross the electron transport layer to chemically etch the electrode ITO to generate In3+, which will migrate upwards into the perovskite film. Then, the reaction that corrodes ITO consumes the decomposition products of perovskite and shifts the balance of the perovskite decomposition reaction, further promoting the degradation and thus falling into a positive feedback cycle. Moreover, the In3+ in the perovskite film was found to accumulate at the upper surface, which would lead to n&#8208;type doping of perovskite film to form the energy barrier for interface carrier extraction. Subsequently, the chelating molecule ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA&#8208;2Na) was introduced onto ITO to firmly chelate the In3+ and prevent it from migrating upward, thus breaking this internal positive feedback cycle and significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This work provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of photovoltaic performance loss and ionic transport in PSCs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ortho/Ipso C&#8722;H Difunctionalizations of Arenes using Thianthrene as a Leaving Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthrenation/Catellani&#8221; strategy, the regioselective C&#8722;H difunctionalization of various non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes was successfully achieved. Starting from thianthrenium salts and using a commercially available norbornene, this approach will further open the chemical space of late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective ortho/ipso C&#8722;H difunctionalizations of aromatic compounds were designed to afford polyfunctionalized arenes including challenging 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted ones (62&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yields). To ensure the excellent regioselectivity of the process while keeping high efficiency, an original strategy based on a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthenation/Catellani&#8208;type reaction&#8221; sequence was developed starting from simple arenes. Non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes were first regioselectively converted into the corresponding thianthrenium salts. Then, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, norbornene (NBE)&#8208;mediated process allowed the synthesis of ipso&#8208;olefinated/ortho&#8208;alkylated polyfunctionalized arenes using a thianthrene as a leaving group (revisited Catellani reaction). Pleasingly, using a commercially available norbornene (NBE) and a unique catalytic system, synthetic challenges known for the Catellani reaction with aryl iodides were smoothly and successfully tackled with the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; approach. The protocol was robust (gram&#8208;scale reaction) and was widely applied to the two&#8208;fold functionalization of various arenes including bio&#8208;active compounds. Moreover, a panel of olefins and alkyl halides as coupling partners was suitable. Pleasingly, the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; strategy was successfully further applied to the incorporation of other groups at the ipso (CN/alkyl/H, aryl) and ortho (alkyl, aryl, amine, thiol) positions, showcasing the generality of the process.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Photodetector with High Operational Stability Using Self&#8208;Trapped Cs3Cu2I5 Interfacial Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals transport layer has been embedded in photodiode structures to simultaneously realize bias&#8208;switchable organic photodetectors exhibiting photovoltaic (0&#8197;V) and photomultiplication operating modes (1&#8197;V) with fast response speed, remarkable stability and broad to different organic systems, indicating a versatile strategy for future integrated organic optoelectronic scenarios.







Abstract
Conventional photovoltaic (PV)&#8208;photodetectors are hard to detect fainted signals, while photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;capable devices indispensable for detecting weak light and are prone to degrade under strong light illumination and large bias, and it is urgent to realize highly efficient integrated detecting system with both PM and PV operation modes. In this work, one lead&#8208;free Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals with self&#8208;trapping exciton nature was introduced as interfacial layer adjacent to bulk and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer heterojunction structure, and corresponding organic photodetectors with bias&#8208;switchable dual modes are demonstrated. The fabricated device exhibits low operating bias (0&#8197;V for PV mode and 0.8&#8197;V for PM mode), high specific detectivity (~1013&#8197;Jones), fast response speed as low as 1.59&#8197;&#956;s, large bandwidth over 0.2&#8197;MHz and long&#8208;term operational stability last for 4&#8197;months in ambient condition. This synergy strategy also validated in different materials and device architectures, providing a convenient and scalable production process to develop highly efficient bias&#8208;switchable multi&#8208;functional organic optoelectrical applications.

         <title>Cyclic Azahelicene Dimers Showing Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Selective Fluoride Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized, and the diastereomeric pairs were successively separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers which showed bright circularly polarized luminescence and selective recognition of a fluoride anion.







Abstract
Although helicenes are promising molecules, the synthetic difficulty and tediousness have often been problems, and only small amounts of optically pure helicenes have been obtained by using chiral HPLC in most cases. Herein, aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized via the intramolecular Scholl reaction, and the diastereomeric pairs were separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers, and the chiroptical properties were investigated. The rigid &#960;&#8208;frameworks of the dimers led to the high molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields, while the twisted helicene moieties induced clear Cotton effects and CPL in the visible region, and the high CPL brightness (BCPL) was achieved. Furthermore, the cyclic dimers were found to have the macrocyclic cavity with the two NH groups suitable for the selective binding of a fluoride anion, which induced significantly redshifted fluorescence and CPL in the red region.

         <title>Thermal and Photoinduced Radical Cascade Annulation using Aryl Isonitriles: An Approach to Quinoline&#8208;Derived Benzophosphole Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides and aryl isonitriles is presented. These &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we present a radical cascade addition cyclization sequence to access quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides using various aryl isonitriles as radical acceptors and inexpensive tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a terminal oxidant in the presence of a catalytic amount of silver acetate. Alternatively, the same cascade can be realized through a sustainable photochemical approach utilizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as an organic photocatalyst at room temperature. The introduced modular approach shows broad functional group tolerance and offers straightforward access to complex P,N&#8208;containing polyheterocyclic arenes. These novel &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties such as absorption in the visible region, emission and reversible reduction at low potentials, which makes them promising for potential materials science applications. The photophysical properties can further be tuned by the addition of external Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

Three new donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type interfacial dipole molecules are designed by incorporating hole transporting and different anchoring groups, which contributing to energy&#8208;level alignment, improved charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite interface. TPA&#8208;BAM&#8208;treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 25.29&#8201;% with the enhanced voltage of 1.174&#8197;V and fill factor of 84.34&#8201;%, while also demonstrating improved stability.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of perovskite films has been the main strategies in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, three new donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type interfacial dipole (DAID) molecules with hole&#8208;transporting and different anchoring units are designed and employed in PSCs. The formation of interface dipoles by the DAID molecules on the perovskite film can efficiently modulate the energy level alignment, improve charge extraction, and reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination. Among the three DAID molecules, TPA&#8208;BAM with amide group exhibits the best chemical and optoelectrical properties, achieving a champion PCE of 25.29&#8201;% with the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.174&#8197;V and fill factor of 84.34&#8201;%, due to the reduced defect density and improved interfacial hole extraction. Meanwhile, the operational stability of the unencapsulated device has been significantly improved. Our study provides a prospect for rationalized screening of interfacial dipole materials for efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Using Metastable Zirconium Suboxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suboxide zirconium (Zr3O) formed at the Zr&#8722;ZrO2 interface serves as an exceptional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), demonstrating remarkable durability lasting up to 50&#8197;days in Zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) devices, highlighting the potential of metastable phases in advancing the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Strategies for discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts are important to advance clean energy technologies. Metastable phases such as low temperature or interfacial structures that are difficult to access in bulk may offer such catalytically active surfaces. We report here that the suboxide Zr3O, which is formed at Zr&#8722;ZrO2 interfaces but does not appear in the experimental Zr&#8722;O phase diagram exhibits outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance surpassing that of benchmark Pt/C and most transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Addition of Fe3C nanoparticles to give a Zr&#8722;Zr3O&#8722;Fe3C/NC catalyst (NC=nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) gives a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.914&#8197;V, outperforming Pt/C and showing only a 3&#8197;mV decrease after 20,000 electrochemical cycles. A zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using this cathode material has a high power density of 241.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remains stable for over 50&#8197;days of continuous cycling, demonstrating potential for practical applications. Zr3O demonstrates that interfacial or other phases that are difficult to stabilize may offer new directions for the discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

We report here that the suboxide Zr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is formed at Zr&#8722;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces but does not appear in the experimental Zr&#8722;O phase diagram exhibits outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance surpassing that of benchmark Pt/C and most transition metal-based catalysts. Addition of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles to give a Zr&#8722;Zr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C/NC catalyst (NC=nitrogen-doped carbon) gives a half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.914&#8197;V, outperforming Pt/C and showing only a 3&#8197;mV decrease after 20,000 electrochemical cycles. A zinc-air battery (ZAB) using this cathode material has a high power density of 241.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and remains stable for over 50&#8197;days of continuous cycling, demonstrating potential for practical applications. Zr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O demonstrates that interfacial or other phases that are difficult to stabilize may offer new directions for the discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8722;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt SAs through the strategy of external ligand grafting on MOFs, the electron density and steric factor of Pt(II) centers thereby were achieved accurate modulation. In addition, the incorporation of Pt(bpy)Cl2 as an electron acceptor induced the efficient interface migration of photoinduced electrons, relizing a 225&#8208;times improvement of photocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.

         <title>Designed Additive to Regulated Crystallization for High Performance Perovskite Solar Cell</title>

By introducing DFA additive into perovskite solution and interacting with DMSO, DTE and DA products were obtained. The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality and low defects perovskite film. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
It is a crucial role for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which can be achieved by delaying the crystallization of perovskite film. Hence, we designed difluoroacetic anhydride (DFA) as an additive to regulating crystallization process thus reducing defect formation during perovskite film formation. It was found DFA reacts with DMSO by forming two molecules, difluoroacetate thioether ester (DTE) and difluoroacetic acid (DA). The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality film formation, which was monitored through in situ UV/Vis and PL tests. By using DFA additives, we prepared perovskite films with high&#8208;quality and low defects. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients.







Abstract
The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4&#8197;days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.

         <title>Bridging Nickel&#8208;MOF and Copper Single Atoms/Clusters with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>

         <dc:description>
Few&#8208;layered H&#8208;substituted graphdiyne bridges ultrathin Ni&#8208;MOF nanosheets and Cu single atoms/clusters to construct a tandem electrocatalyst for enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia transformation. The synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Cu is revealed to optimize the reaction path, resulting in a high efficiency over a wide potential window.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of synergistic catalysts is one of the keys to achieving multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. Herein, by joining ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (denoted Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheets with few&#8208;layered hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne&#8208;supported copper single atoms and clusters (denoted HsGDY@Cu), a tandem catalyst of Ni&#8208;MOFs@HsGDY@Cu with dual&#8208;active interfaces was developed for the concerted catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia. In such a system, the sandwiched HsGDY layer could serve as a bridge to connect the coordinated unsaturated Ni2+ sites with Cu single atoms/clusters in a limited range of 0 to 3.6&#8197;nm. From Ni2+ to Cu, via the hydrogen spillover process, the hydrogen radicals (H&#8901;) generated at the unsaturated Ni2+ sites could migrate across HsGDY to the Cu sites to participate in the transformation of *HNO3 to NH3. From Cu to Ni2+, bypassing the higher reaction energy for *HNO3 formation on the Ni2+ sites, the NO2&#8722; detached from the Cu sites could diffuse onto the unsaturated Ni2+ sites to form NH3 as well. The combined results make this hybrid a tandem catalyst with dual active sites for the catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with improved Faradaic efficiency at lower overpotentials.

In such a system, the sandwiched HsGDY layer could serve as a bridge to connect the coordinated unsaturated Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites with Cu single atoms/clusters in a limited range of 0 to 3.6&#8197;nm. From Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cu, via the hydrogen spillover process, the hydrogen radicals (H&#8901;) generated at the unsaturated Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites could migrate across HsGDY to the Cu sites to participate in the transformation of *HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. From Cu to Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, bypassing the higher reaction energy for *HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formation on the Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; detached from the Cu sites could diffuse onto the unsaturated Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites to form NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as well. The combined results make this hybrid a tandem catalyst with dual active sites for the catalysis of nitrate-to-ammonia conversion with improved Faradaic efficiency at lower overpotentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled Active and Stable Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; Interfaces for CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal B&#8208;site supplement of Mn ions via topotactic exchange and external protective barrier of MnOx shell via redispersion in reduction atmosphere facilitate the formation of Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; interfaces and enhance their structural stability, achieving improved activity and durability for CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells.







Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells are prospective approaches for CO2 utilization but face significant challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability of the fuel electrodes. Herein, we strategically addressed the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between enhanced exsolution and improved structural stability via topotactic ion exchange. The surface dynamic reconstruction of the MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (LSCIr) catalyst was visualized at the atomic scale. Compared with the Ir@LSCIr interface, the in situ self&#8208;assembled Ir@MnOx/LSCIr interface exhibited greater CO2 activation and easily removable carbonate intermediates, thus reached a 42&#8201;% improvement in CO2 electrolysis performance at 1.6&#8197;V. Furthermore, an improved CO2 electrolysis stability was achieved due to the uniformly wrapped MnOx shell of the Ir@MnOx/LSCIr cathode. Our approach enables a detailed understanding of the dynamic microstructure evolution at active interfaces and provides a roadmap for the rational design and evaluation of efficient metal/oxide catalysts for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Tuning Ion Mobility in Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Configurational entropy in the cation sublattice, induced by complex substitution, shows a direct correlation with Li+ mobility in superionic lithium argyrodite solid electrolytes.







Abstract
The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) technologies. In recent years, multicomponent or high&#8208;entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge&#8208;transport and (electro)chemical properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how configurational entropy affects ionic conductivity is largely lacking. Herein we investigate a series of multication&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li6+x[M1aM2bM3cM4d]S5I, with M being P, Si, Ge, and Sb. Structure&#8208;property relationships related to ion mobility are probed using a combination of diffraction techniques, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and charge&#8208;transport measurements. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental evidence of a direct correlation between occupational disorder in the cationic host lattice and lithium transport. By controlling the configurational entropy through compositional design, high bulk ionic conductivities up to 18&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature are achieved for optimized lithium argyrodites. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors via entropy engineering, overcoming compositional limitations for the design of advanced electrolytes and opening up new avenues in the field.

         <title>Surface Coordination Modulated Morphological Anisotropic Engineering of Iron&#8208;Benzoquinone Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the surface coordination of carbon for morphological engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ is realized, the morphology of which evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon substrate. It exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performance for lithium storage.







Abstract
Morphological anisotropic engineering is powerful to synthesize metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with versatile physicochemical properties for diverse applications ranging from gas storage/separation to electrocatalysis and batteries, etc. Herein, we developed a carbon substrate guided strategy to manipulate the facet&#8208;dependent coordination for morphology engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ (tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) frameworks, which is built with cubic Fe octamer bridged by two parallel THBQ ligands along three orthogonal axes, extending to a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework with pcu&#8208;e network topology. The electronegative O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon surfaces compete with THBQ linkers to selectively interact with the unsaturated coordinated Fe cations on the {111} facets and inhibit crystal growth along the &lt;111&gt; direction. The morphology of Fe&#8208;THBQ evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon substrate. The Fe&#8208;THBQ with varied morphologies exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performances for electrochemical lithium storage. This work will shed light on the morphology modulation of MOFs for promising applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Formation of Charge Transfer Trions at Molecular&#8208;Functionalized 2D MoS2 Interfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Trion dynamics at an organometallic molecule/monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8722;MoS2) is investigated via transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. We observed an ultrafast hole transfer, followed by the formation of charge&#8208;transfer trions.







Abstract
In this work, we investigate trion dynamics occurring at the heterojunction between organometallic molecules and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. By pumping at 2.4&#8197;eV with laser pulses, we have observed an ultrafast hole transfer, succeeded by the emergence of charge&#8208;transfer trions. This observation is facilitated by the cancellation of ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals due to their opposite phases, making tr&#8208;ESFG especially sensitive to the trion formation dynamics. The presence of charge&#8208;transfer trion at molecular functionalized TMD monolayers suggests the potential for engineering the local electronic structures and dynamics of specific locations on TMDs and offers a potential for transferring unique electronic attributes of TMD to the molecular layers.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acid Loading onto a Bacterial Thiotemplate Assembly Line via a Multienzyme Gateway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular warhead for the virulence factor malleicyprol derives from trigonic acid, a cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid. Its incorporation involves an incomplete nonribosomal peptide synthetase module and two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, an adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme and an FkbH&#8208;like enzyme for translocation. The mechanism for the direct loading of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids may inspire synthetic biology and antivirulence approaches.







Abstract
Various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) create structural and functional diversity by incorporating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids into peptide backbones. Trigonic acid, an unusual cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid, is the source of the molecular warhead of malleicyprol, a critical virulence factor of human and animal pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group. The process of selecting and loading this building block remained enigmatic as the NRPS module designated for this task is incomplete. Using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, targeted metabolomics, and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that two trans&#8208;acting enzymes are required to load this central building block onto the modular assembly line. An adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme (BurJ) activates trigonic acid, followed by the translocation of the enzyme&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid thioester by an FkbH&#8208;like protein with a mutated phosphatase domain (BurH). This specialized gateway is the first reported direct loading of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid onto a bona fide NRPS module in bacteria and expands the synthetic biology toolbox for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of non&#8208;canonical building blocks. Moreover, insight into the biochemical basis of virulence factor biosynthesis can provide a foundation for developing enzyme inhibitors as anti&#8208;virulence therapeutics against BP pathogen infections.

         <title>Electric Double Layer Regulator Design through a Functional Group Assembly Strategy towards Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric double layer regulator, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS), is rationally designed by a functional group assembly strategy. The high adsorption ability of the imidazole group in IS with zinc anode facilitates the formation of an IS molecular layer to suppress side reactions. Meanwhile, the high binding capability of sulfone group in IS with Zn2+ promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ to achieve uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Regulating the electric double layer (EDL) structure of the zinc metal anode by using electrolyte additives is an efficient way to suppress interface side reactions and facilitate uniform zinc deposition. Nevertheless, there are no reports investigating the proactive design of EDL&#8208;regulating additives before the start of experiments. Herein, a functional group assembly strategy is proposed to design electrolyte additives for modulating the EDL, thereby realizing a long&#8208;lasting zinc metal anode. Specifically, by screening ten common functional groups, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS) is designed by assembling an imidazole group, characterized by its high adsorption capability on the zinc anode, and a sulfone group, which exhibits strong binding with Zn2+ ions. Benefiting from the adsorption functionalization of the imidazole group, the IS molecules occupy the position of H2O in the inner Helmholtz layer of the EDL, forming a molecular protective layer to inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions. Meanwhile, the sulfone group in IS, acting as a binding site to Zn2+, promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ ions, facilitating compact zinc deposition. Consequently, the utilization of IS significantly extending the cycling stability of Zn||Zn and Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cell. This study offers an innovative approach to the design of EDL regulators for high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;Migration at Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Constructed from &#945;&#8208;Keto Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;keto imines generated enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines possessing synthetically challenging vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters. The electrophilicity of the imine and steric effects promoted a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl migration in the presence of Lewis acidic boronic acids, yielding chiral &#945;&#8208;amino ketones with excellent diastereoselectivity. This method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.







Abstract
A carbonyl&#8208;assisted asymmetric 1,2&#8208;migratory allylation through in situ generation of vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters is reported to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino ketones and amino alcohols with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. In a remarkable divergence, despite higher steric hindrance, the allylation exclusively occurs on ketones over imines in the first step, followed by a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl transfer, thus highlighting an exciting interplay between two distinct electrophiles. The methodology distinguishes itself through its adaptability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, showcasing broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and stereodivergence. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis led to a deeper understanding of its selectivity and mechanistic framework. Highlighting its transformative potential, the method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the need to reduce global carbon emissions, it remains a great challenge to prepare nacre&#8208;inspired composites using more economical and environmentally friendly building blocks. We fabricated tough and conductive nacre composites through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridging by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The resultant conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance.







Abstract
Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~282&#8197;MPa and ~6.3&#8197;MPa&#8201;m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.

         <title>ON&#8211;OFF Control of Marangoni Self&#8208;propulsion via A Supra&#8208;amphiphile Fuel and Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; to realize ON&#8211;OFF control of Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion of miniaturized devices. The supra&#8208;amphiphile shows two competitive processes on water surface: adsorption and hydrolysis, whose competence is pH&#8208;responsive. They have comparable rates under neutral conditions to prolong the motion by 50&#8208;fold; when changing to acid, motion stop is realized owing to faster hydrolysis than adsorption.

Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion refers to motion of liquid or solid driven by a surface tension gradient, and has applications in soft robots/devices, cargo delivery, self&#8208;assembly etc. However, two problems remain to be addressed for motion control (e.g., ON&#8211;OFF) with conventional surfactants as Marangoni fuel: (1)&#8197;limited motion lifetime due to saturated interfacial adsorption of surfactants; (2)&#8197;in&#8208; situ motion stop is difficult once Marangoni flows are triggered. Instead of covalent surfactants, supra&#8208;amphiphiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts linked noncovalently, hold promise to solve these problems owing to its dynamic and reversible surface activity responsively. Here, we propose a new concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; based on the facile synthesis of disodium&#8208;4&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (DABS) linked by a Schiff base, which has amphiphilicity for self&#8208;propulsion, hydrolyzes timely to avoid saturated adsorption, and provides pH&#8208;responsive control over ON&#8208;OFF motion. The self&#8208;propulsion lifetime is extended by 50&#8208;fold with DABS and motion control is achieved. The mechanism is revealed with coupled interface chemistry involving two competitive processes of interfacial adsorption and hydrolysis of DABS based on both experiments and simulation. The concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; provides an active solution to prolong and control Marangoni self&#8208;propulsive devices for the advance of intelligent material systems.

     alt="ON&#8211;OFF Control of Marangoni Self-propulsion via A Supra-amphiphile Fuel and Switch"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a concept of &#8216;supra-amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; to realize ON&#8211;OFF control of Marangoni self-propulsion of miniaturized devices. The supra-amphiphile shows two competitive processes on water surface: adsorption and hydrolysis, whose competence is pH-responsive. They have comparable rates under neutral conditions to prolong the motion by 50-fold; when changing to acid, motion stop is realized owing to faster hydrolysis than adsorption.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stepwise Protonation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs were constructed and modified through a stepwise protonation of imine and porphyrin sites. Both benzo&#8208;selenadiazole functional groups and dual protonation increase the visible light absorption and charge separation, synergistically promoting the photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), recognized for their tailorable structures and accessible active sites, offer a promising platform for developing advanced photocatalysts. However, the difficulty in the synthesis and functionalization of 3D COFs hinders their further development. In this study, we present a series of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs with 8 connected porphyrin units linked by linear linkers through imine bonds as a versatile platform for photocatalyst design. The photoresponse of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs was initially modulated by functionalizing linear linkers with benzo&#8208;thiadiazole or benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups. Furthermore, taking advantage of the well&#8208;exposed porphyrin and imine sites in 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs, their photocatalytic activity was optimized by stepwise protonation of imine bonds and porphyrin centers. The dual protonated COF with benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups exhibited enhanced charge separation, leading to an increased photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. This enhancement demonstrates the combined benefits of linker functionalization and stepwise protonation on photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Eosinophil&#8208;Activating Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

The eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNe) synergized with immune checkpoint inhibitors are developed to reinvigorate eosinophil&#8208; and T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, providing a new avenue for cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Eosinophils are important immune effector cells that affect T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. However, the low frequency and restrained activity of eosinophils restricted the outcome of cancer immunotherapies. We herein report an eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNe) to improve photodynamic tumor immunogenicity, modulate eosinophil chemotaxis, and reinvigorate T&#8208;cell immunity for activated cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNe comprises an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor sitagliptin via a 1O2&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker. Upon localized NIR photoirradiation, SPNe generates 1O2 to elicit immunogenic cell death of tumors and induce specific activation of sitagliptin. The subsequent inhibition of DPP4 increases intratumoral CCL11 levels to promote eosinophil chemotaxis and activation. SPNe&#8208;mediated photo&#8208;immunotherapy synergized with immune checkpoint blockade greatly promotes tumor infiltration and activation of both eosinophils and T&#8197;cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, this study presents a generic polymeric nanoplatform to modulate specific immune cells for precision cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Leveraging Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect for Catalytic Polymerization and Degradation of a Cyclobutane Monomer System</title>

         <dc:description>
DFT calculations guide to unveil the electron push&#8208;pull effect in reshaping the polymerizability of non&#8208;polymerizable cyclobutane to afford densely functionalized all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as their degradation to afford alkene derivatives. Successful polymerization conditions consist of Lewis acid, Br&#248;nsted base, and a C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator, while degradation proceeds with catalytic amount of an acid.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) offers a striking solution to solve problems encountered in step&#8208;growth condensation polymerization, including precise control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and topology. This has inspired our interest in ROP of cycloalkanes with an ultimate goal to rethink polyolefins, which clearly poses a number of challenges. Practicality of ROP of cycloalkanes is actually limited by their low polymerizability and elusive mechanisms which arise from significantly varied ring size and non&#8208;polar C&#8722;C bonds in monomers. In this work, by using Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base/C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator system previously developed in our laboratory, we focus on cyclobutanes and explore the positional and electronic effects of substituents on the ring, namely electron push&#8208;pull effect, in promoting controlled polymerization to afford densely functionalized poly(cyclobutanes), as well as catalytic degradation of obtained polymers for upcycling. More importantly, experiments and DFT calculations unveil considerable population of Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;induced thermostabilized 1,4&#8208;zwitterions, which distinguish cyclobutanes from cyclopropanes and others. All these findings would shed light on catalytic synthesis and degradation of saturated all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as small molecule transformations of cyclobutanes.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Donor&#8208;Modification of Boracyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems beyond Steric Protection to Produce Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of a boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and electron&#8208;donating phenothiazinyl groups resulted in a short ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor structures, these compounds exhibited thermally activated delayed orange&#8208;red fluorescence when doped into thin films. In organic light emitting diodes, a bis&#8208;ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivative exhibited better performance than the corresponding mono&#8208;substituted congener.







Abstract
Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds that contain tricoordinate boron atoms at their periphery represent an attractive class of materials with electron&#8208;accepting character. Their molecular design generally requires the introduction of a bulky aryl group onto the boron atom, where it provides predominantly kinetic stabilization. The addition of extra functionality to the aryl group on the boron atom can be expected to further expand the potential utility of this class of materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of boracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with firm ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N nonbonding interactions by introducing N&#8208;containing electron&#8208;donors at the ortho&#8208;positions of the aryl group on the boron atom. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the combination of a planar boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and a strong electron&#8208;donating phenothiazine moiety results in a particularly short B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Theoretical study provided insights into the inherent nature of the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures, these molecules exhibit substantially red&#8208;shifted fluorescence in solution, albeit that the fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are low. In contrast, when incorporated into films, these compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with improved &#934;F values.

&lt;p&gt;Combination of a boracyclic &#960;-skeleton with only sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbons and electron-donating phenothiazinyl groups resulted in a short &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor structures, these compounds exhibited thermally activated delayed orange-red fluorescence when doped into thin films. In organic light emitting diodes, a bis-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-donor-substituted derivative exhibited better performance than the corresponding mono-substituted congener.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic &#960;-conjugated compounds that contain tricoordinate boron atoms at their periphery represent an attractive class of materials with electron-accepting character. Their molecular design generally requires the introduction of a bulky aryl group onto the boron atom, where it provides predominantly kinetic stabilization. The addition of extra functionality to the aryl group on the boron atom can be expected to further expand the potential utility of this class of materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of boracyclic &#960;-conjugated molecules with firm &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N nonbonding interactions by introducing N-containing electron-donors at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-positions of the aryl group on the boron atom. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the combination of a planar boracyclic &#960;-skeleton with only sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbons and a strong electron-donating phenothiazine moiety results in a particularly short B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Theoretical study provided insights into the inherent nature of the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures, these molecules exhibit substantially red-shifted fluorescence in solution, albeit that the fluorescence quantum yields (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) are low. In contrast, when incorporated into films, these compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with improved &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; values. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated using the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-donor-substituted derivatives exhibit orange-red electroluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;DNA Carriers Co&#8208;Deliver Photosensitizer and siRNA for Light&#8208;Promoted Gene Transfection and Hypoxia&#8208;Relieved Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Developing synthetic polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras provides new opportunities for material development. Herein, we demonstrate that the micellar nanostructures self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA chimeras can efficiently, straightforwardly, and bio&#8208;compatibly co&#8208;deliver siRNA and organic photosensitizers, resulting in significantly enhanced gene/photodynamic synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy.







Abstract
Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Nanoneedle Electrodes for Dopamine Detection in Drosophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in Drosophila larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).







Abstract
In vivo electrochemistry in small brain regions or synapses requires nanoelectrodes with long straight tips for submicron scale measurements. Nanoelectrodes can be fabricated using a Nanoscribe two&#8208;photon printer, but annealed tips curl if they are long and thin. We propose a new pulling&#8208;force strategy to fabricate a straight carbon nanoneedle structure. A micron&#8208;width bridge is printed between two blocks. The annealed structure shrinks during pyrolysis, and the blocks create a pulling force to form a long, thin, and straight carbon bridge. Parameterization study and COMSOL modeling indicate changes in the block size, bridge size and length affect the pulling force and bridge shrinkage. Electrodes were printed on niobium wires, insulated with aluminum oxide, and the bridge cut with focused ion beam (FIB) to expose the nanoneedle tip. Annealed needle diameters ranged from 400&#8197;nm to 5.25&#8197;&#956;m and length varied from 50.5&#8197;&#956;m to 146&#8197;&#956;m. The electrochemical properties are similar to glassy carbon, with good performance for dopamine detection with fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry. Nanoelectrodes enable biological applications, such as dopamine detection in a specific Drosophila brain region. Long and thin nanoneedles are generally useful for other applications such as cellular sensing, drug delivery, or gas sensing.

         <title>Ligand Isomerization Driven Electrocatalytic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand geometry can direct the reactivity and selectivity of dioxygen cleavage in molecular electrocatalysis. It is shown that even on exclusively peroxide&#8208;producing catalytic sites, the dioxygen binding modes can be precisely controlled via a seemingly minor change in ligand isomerization, with their activity almost equaling that of Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell.







Abstract
The prevailing view about molecular catalysts is that the central metal ion is responsible for the reaction mechanism and selectivity, whereas the ligands mainly affect the reaction kinetics. Here, we question this paradigm and show that ligands have a dramatic influence on the selectivity of the product. We show how even a seemingly small change in ligand isomerization sharply alters the selectivity of the well&#8208;researched oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) Co phthalocyanine catalyst from an indirect 2e&#8722; to a direct 4e&#8722; pathway. Detailed analysis reveals that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions in the ligand activate the catalytic Co, directing the oxygen binding and thus deciding the final product. The resulting catalyst is the first example of a Co&#8208;based molecular catalyst catalyzing a direct 4e&#8722; ORR via ligand isomerization, for which it shows an activity close to the benchmark Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell. The effect of the ligand isomerism is demonstrated with different central metal ions, thus highlighting the generalizability of the findings and their potential to open new possibilities in the design of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of n&#8208;Propanol from CO2 Electroreduction on Bicontinuous Cu2O/Cu Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Propanol can be efficiently produced by ampere&#8208;level CO2 electroreduction by a Cu2O/Cu catalyst with bicontinuous structure. The catalyst is assembled by nanodomains (&lt;10&#8197;nm) of Cu2O and Cu and possesses numerous grain boundaries between the Cu and Cu2O phases.







Abstract
n&#8208;propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n&#8208;propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n&#8208;propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra&#8208;small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n&#8208;propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO&#8208;*CO coupling and *CO&#8208;*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n&#8208;propanol.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Responsive Peptide&#8208;Based Ultrathin Nanosheets Prepared by a Horizontal Monolayer Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ~1&#8197;nm were prepared via a hierarchical covalent physical approach and enabled by two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer self&#8208;assembly. The ultrathin nanosheets can respond to various external stimuli and transform into diverse morphologies, with morphological changes in response to pH, allowing them to selectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
In this study, peptide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 1&#8197;nm were prepared using a hierarchical covalent physical fabrication strategy. The covalent alternating polymerization of helical peptide E3 with an azobenzene (AZO) structure yielded copolymers CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), which physically self&#8208;assembled into ultrathin nanosheets in an unanticipated two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer arrangement. This special monolayer arrangement enabled the thickness of the nanosheets to be equal to the cross&#8208;sectional diameter of a single linear copolymer, which is a rare phenomenon. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the synergistic effect of multiple molecular interactions drives the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO) into nanosheets and that various methods, including phototreatment, pH adjustment, the addition of additives, and introduction of cosolvents, can alter the molecular interactions and modulate the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), yielding diverse nanostructures. Remarkably, the ultrathin nanosheets selectively inhibited cancer cells at certain concentrations.

         <title>Ordering Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd Catalysts onto Orderly Mesoporous SrTiO3&#8208;Crystal Nanotubular Networks for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work resolved the inherent contradiction between the superior pore structure and crystallinity of metal oxides by developing an updated synthesis method using the electrospinning technique, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer in photocatalytic heterogeneous reactions. With the assistance of ordered Cu&#8722;Pd alloy, the catalysts exhibit a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of fuels has garnered significant attention, with SrTiO3 emerging as a potential candidate for photocatalysis due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. However, selectively converting CO2 into fuels with desired reaction products remains a grand challenge. Herein, we design an updated method via an aging strategy based on the electrospinning technique to synthesize a single&#8208;crystalline Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 nanotubular networks with self&#8208;assembled orderly mesopores, further modified by Cu&#8722;Pd alloy. It exhibits both high crystallinity and superior cross&#8208;linked mesoporous structures, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer, with a remarkable enhancement from 0.025&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 1.090&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 in the CO production rate. Meanwhile, the ordered arrangement of Cu and Pd atoms on the (111) surface can promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2 to *COOH), which is also responsible for its good activity. The presence of CuO in the reaction confers a significant advantage for CO desorption, leading to a remarkable CO selectivity of 95.54&#8201;%. This work highlights new insights into developing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts.

Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems offer a promising solution for solar energy storage. We present silver salts as a distinctive catalyst class capable of releasing stored energy from the promising dihydroazaborinine&#8208;based MOST system. Through mechanistic investigations and computational analysis, we gained insights into the silver&#8208;catalyzed thermal back reaction, while revealing the first crystal structure of a Dewar dihydroazaborinine.







Abstract
Molecular solar thermal systems (MOST) represent an auspicious solution for the storage of solar energy. We report silver salts as a unique class of catalysts, capable of releasing the stored energy from the promising 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine based MOST system. Mechanistic investigations provided insights into the silver catalyzed thermal backreaction, concurrently unveiling the first crystal structure of a 2&#8208;aza&#8208;3&#8208;borabicyclo[2.2.0]hex&#8208;5&#8208;ene, the Dewar isomer of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine. Quantification of activation energies by kinetic experiments has elucidated the advantageous energy change associated with Lewis acid catalysts, a phenomenon corroborated through computational analysis. By means of low temperature NMR spectroscopy, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Ag+ to the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine were gained.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Thiazolines from 4&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehydes Using Vanillyl Alcohol Oxidases</title>

         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols in the presence of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) occurred through a spontaneous condensation reaction followed by preferential enzymatic oxidation of the in situ generated C&#8722;N bond over other competing functional groups. The biocatalysts showed good substrate tolerance, and the enzymatic products could be chemically modified to expand the structural diversity.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles are commonly found in bioactive natural products and drugs. However, the biocatalytic tools for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis are limited. Herein, we report the discovery of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) as efficient biocatalysts for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from various 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols. The wild&#8208;type biocatalyst features a broad scope of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes. Though the scope of aminothiols is limited, it could be improved via semi&#8208;rational protein engineering, generating a variant to produce previously inaccessible cysteine&#8208;derived bioactive 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines using the wild&#8208;type VAO. Benefiting from the derivatizable functional groups in the enzymatic products, we further chemically modified these products to expand the chemical space, offering a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the green and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;thiazoline derivatives to prompt their use in drug discovery and catalysis.

         <dc:description>
The in situ hydrolysis of an insoluble anhydride produces chiral carboxylate in the aqueous phase, a signal that is recognized by artificial zinc(II)&#8208;capped membrane receptors embedded in micelles.

Natural membrane receptors are proteins that can report on changes in the concentration of external chemical messengers. Messenger binding to a receptor produces conformational changes that are relayed through the membrane into the cell; this information allows cells to adapt to changes in their environment. Artificial membrane receptors (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1 are helical &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) foldamers that replicate key parts of this information relay. Solution&#8208;phase 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of zinc(II)&#8208;capped receptor 1, either in organic solvent or in membrane&#8208;mimetic micelles, showed messenger binding produced an enrichment of either left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed screw&#8208;sense; the chirality of the bound messenger was relayed to the other receptor terminus. Furthermore, in situ production of a chemical messenger in the external aqueous environment could be detected in real&#8208;time by a racemic mixture of receptor 1 in micelles. The hydrolysis of insoluble anhydrides produced carboxylate in the aqueous phase, which bound to the receptors and gave a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.

         <title>Influence of Ti&#8208;incorporated Zeolite Topology and Pore Condensation on Vapor Phase Propylene Epoxidation Kinetics with Gaseous H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propylene epoxidation and sequential reaction kinetics reflect the physical properties of catalysts and pore filling with gaseous solvents even without bulk liquid phase. Interactions between zeolite pores, reactant, and solvent molecules respond to changes in zeolite topology, pore polarity, and solvent pressure, resulting in significant changes in propylene epoxidation rates and propylene oxide product selectivities.







Abstract
Vapor&#8208;phase propylene (C3H6) epoxidation kinetics with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) strongly reflects the physical properties of Ti&#8208;incorporated zeolite catalysts and the presence of spectating molecules (&#8220;solvent&#8221;) near active sites even without a bulk liquid phase. Steady&#8208;state turnover rates of C3H6 epoxidation and product selectivities vary by orders of magnitudes, depending on the zeolite silanol ((SiOH)x) density, pore topology (MFI, *BEA, FAU), and the quantity of condensed acetonitrile (CH3CN) molecules nearby active sites, under identical reaction mechanisms sharing activated H2O2 intermediates on Ti surfaces. Individual kinetic analyses for propylene oxide (PO) ring&#8208;opening, homogeneous diol oxidative cleavage, and homogeneous aldehyde oxidation reveal that secondary reaction kinetics following C3H6 epoxidation responds more sensitively to the changes in zeolite physical properties and pore condensation with CH3CN. Thus, higher PO selectivities achieved in hydrophilic Ti&#8208;MFI at steady&#8208;state reflect the preferential stabilization of transition states for C3H6 epoxidation (a primary reaction) relative to PO ring&#8208;opening and oxidative cleavage (secondary reactions) that solvation effects that reflect interactions among condensed CH3CN within pores and the extended pore structure.

         <title>Controlling On&#8208;Surface Photoactivity: The Impact of &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in Anhydride&#8208;Functionalized Molecules on a Semiconductor Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the on&#8208;surface reaction of anhydride&#8208;functionalized molecules as precursors on a SnSe surface investigated by SPM and XPS techniques. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate how their photoactivity can be controlled by modulating the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has become a prominent method for growing low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials on metal surfaces. However, the necessity of decoupling organic nanostructures from metal substrates to exploit their properties requires either transfer methods or new strategies to perform reactions directly on inert surfaces. The use of on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reactions directly on semiconductor/insulating surfaces represents an alternative approach to address these challenges. Here, exploring the photochemical activity of different organic molecules on a SnSe semiconductor surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum, we present a novel on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reaction. The selective photodissociation of the anhydride group is observed, releasing CO and CO2. Moreover, we rationalize the relationship between the photochemical activity and the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core. The different experimental behaviour of two model anhydrides was elucidated by theoretical calculations, showing how the molecular structure influences the distribution of the excited states. Our findings open new pathways for on&#8208;surface synthesis directly on technologically relevant substrates.

         <title>Acyl Phosphates as Chemically Fueled Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Sustaining Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium compartments regulated by an acyl phosphate chemical reaction network via chemical activation of carboxylic acids and alkyl phosphates. The compartments exist in the presence of chemical energy and decay without it. The chemical reaction network produces compartments even with prebiotically relevant activating agents, thus making it an attractive tool for studying Darwinian evolution in prebiotically plausible chemical systems incorporated with genotype&#8208;possessing structures.







Abstract
Lipids spontaneously assemble into vesicle&#8208;forming membranes. Such vesicles serve as compartments for even the simplest living systems. Vesicles have been extensively studied for constructing synthetic cells or as models for protocells&#8212;the cells hypothesized to have existed before life. These compartments exist almost always close to equilibrium. Life, however, exists out of equilibrium. In this work, we studied vesicle&#8208;based compartments regulated by a non&#8208;equilibrium chemical reaction network that converts activating agents. In this way, the compartments require a constant or periodic supply of activating agents to sustain themselves. Specifically, we use activating agents to condense carboxylates and phosphate esters into acyl phosphate&#8208;based lipids that form vesicles. These vesicles can only be sustained when condensing agents are present; without them, they decay. We demonstrate that the chemical reaction network can operate on prebiotic activating agents, opening the door to prebiotically plausible, self&#8208;sustainable protocells that compete for resources. In future work, such protocells should be endowed with a genotype, e.g., self&#8208;replicating RNA structures, to alter the protocell's behavior. Such protocells could enable Darwinian evolution in a prebiotically plausible chemical system.

In the study, three new acceptors BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains, are reported. Due to the intense spatial hindrance effect, the intramolecular rotation is obviously restricted, and the intermolecular packing is substantially altered. Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme&#8208;based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &#916;Enr of 0.19&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next&#8208;generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core. The progressively enlarged steric hindrance from BTP&#8208;B to BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;Biso induces suppressed intramolecular rotation and altered the molecule packing mode in their aggregation states, leading to significant changes in absorption spectra and energy levels. By regulating the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, BTP&#8208;Bme possesses relatively reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and extended exciton diffusion lengths. The binary device based on PB2&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5&#8201;% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.19&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the ternary device comprising PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme achieves an outstanding PCE of 19.3&#8201;%. The molecule design strategy in this study proposed new perspectives for developing high&#8208;performance acceptors with low &#916;Enr in OSCs.

Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme-based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.19&#8197;eV.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next-generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non-radiative energy loss (&lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP-Biso, BTP-Bme and BTP-B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core. The progressively enlarged steric hindrance from BTP-B to BTP-Bme and BTP-Biso induces suppressed intramolecular rotation and altered the molecule packing mode in their aggregation states, leading to significant changes in absorption spectra and energy levels. By regulating the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, BTP-Bme possesses relatively reduced non-radiative recombination rate and extended exciton diffusion lengths. The binary device based on PB2&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5&#8201;% with a low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.19&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the ternary device comprising PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme achieves an outstanding PCE of 19.3&#8201;%. The molecule design strategy in this study proposed new perspectives for developing high-performance acceptors with low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; in OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging DNA&#8208;Encoded Cell&#8208;Mimics for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Transmembrane Channel Release&#8208;Induced Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimics model (ARTC) that effectively mimics the behavior of natural T cells and establishes physicochemical interactions with biological cells. ARTC induce cellular apoptosis by releasing transmembrane channels that respond to the mildly acidic microenvironment, leading to selective outflow of intracellular potassium ions and consequent potent cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
The advancement of cell&#8208;mimic materials, which can forge sophisticated physicochemical dialogues with living cells, has unlocked a realm of intriguing prospects within the fields of synthetic biology and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the evolutionarily acquired ability of T lymphocytes to release perforin and generate transmembrane channels on targeted cells for killing, herein we present a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimic model (ARTC) that accurately mimics T&#8208;cell&#8208;like behavior. ARTC responds to acidic conditions similar to those found in the tumor microenvironment and then selectively releases a G&#8208;rich DNA strand (LG4) embedded with C12 lipid and cholesterol molecules. Once released, LG4 effectively integrates into the membranes of neighboring live cells, behaving as an artificial transmembrane channel that selectively transports K+ ions and disrupts cellular homeostasis, ultimately inducing apoptosis. We hope that the emergence of ARTC will usher in new perspectives for revolutionizing future disease treatment and catalyzing the development of advanced biomedical technologies.

         <title>Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated [B3O6] Units by Mer&#8208;Isomer [YO3F3] Octahedra to Design a UV Nonlinear Optical Material, Cs2YB3O6F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new UV NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with optimal arrangement of [B3O6] groups has been synthesized with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra. It exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest SHG response of 5.6&#215;KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532&#8197;nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5&#8197;nm and DUV transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups.







Abstract
Achieving the extreme balance of the key performance requirements is the crucial to breakthrough the application bottleneck for nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Herein, by assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6] functional species with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra, a new ultraviolet (UV) NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with aligned arrangement of coplanar [B3O6] groups has been synthesized. The polar material exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest second harmonic generation response of 5.6&#215;KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532&#8197;nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5&#8197;nm and deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups. Remarkably, benefiting from the enhanced bonding force among functional units [B3O6], a firm three&#8208;dimensional framework is constructed, which facilitates the growth of large crystals. This can be proved by a block shape crystal with dimensional of 6&#215;5&#215;4&#8197;mm3, indicating that it was a promising UV NLO crystal. This work provides a powerful strategy to design UV NLO materials with good performances.

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>

A processible and stable organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material ATT was facilely prepare by a spontaneous and quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Cycloreversion. ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photo&#8208;irradiation, enabling its applications in the high&#8208;temperature processes, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;fusion, photo&#8208;stamp, photo&#8208;weld and photo&#8208;controlled shaper memory.







Abstract
Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90&#8201;% in just 15&#8197;min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000&#8197;nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.

         <dc:description>
NbC nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanofibers are proposed as electrocatalysts to reduce nitrate/nitrite to ammonia, which attains an outstanding ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal carbides with metallic properties have been extensively used as electrocatalysts due to their excellent conductivity and unique electronic structures. Herein, NbC nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NbC@CNFs) are proposed as an efficient and robust catalyst for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite reduction, which achieves a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.4&#8201;% and a large ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat.. In situ electrochemical tests reveal the nitrite reduction at the catalyst surface follows the *NO pathway and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of NbC@CNFs heterostructure significantly broadens density of states nearby the Fermi energy. Finite element simulations unveil that the current and electric field converge on the NbC nanoparticles along the fiber, suggesting the dispersed carbides are highly active for nitrite reduction.

Herein, NbC nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NbC@CNFs) are proposed as an efficient and robust catalyst for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite reduction, which achieves a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.4&#8201;% and a large ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;. In situ electrochemical tests reveal the nitrite reduction at the catalyst surface follows the *NO pathway and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of NbC@CNFs heterostructure significantly broadens density of states nearby the Fermi energy. Finite element simulations unveil that the current and electric field converge on the NbC nanoparticles along the fiber, suggesting the dispersed carbides are highly active for nitrite reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Acidic Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities Promoted by Alkali Metal Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, promote selective electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 instead of H2O in a highly concentrated acidic electrolyte at high currents. The electrocatalytic environments involving water and alkali metal cations are pivotal in boosting H2O2 generation by stabilizing the crucial *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial&#8208;level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50&#8211;421&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 84&#8211;100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856&#8211;7842&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low&#8208;current electrolysis. Finite&#8208;element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

         <title>Selective Photoreforming of Waste Plastics into Diesel Olefins via Single Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates the generation of triplet excitons, yielding 1O2, enabling the selective photoreformation of PVC into diesel olefins. Conversely, Zn&#8208;TCPP promotes exciton dissociation due to its built&#8208;in electric field, generating &#8901;O2&#8722;, leading to the selective photoreformation of PE into diesel olefins. This highlights a universal approach for selective photoreforming of waste plastics via single ROS.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste poses a pressing environmental challenge. Catalytic conversion stands out as an ideal approach for plastics upcycling, particularly through solar&#8208;driven plastics photoreforming. However, due to the common effects of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), selectively generating high&#8208;value chemicals becomes challenging. In this study, we developed a universal strategy to achieve &gt;85&#8201;% selective production of diesel olefins (C15&#8211;C28) from polyolefin waste plastics via single ROS. Using tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin supramolecular (TCPP) with different central metals as an example to regulate single ROS generation, results show Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates triplet exciton production, yielding 1O2, while Zn&#8208;TCPP generates &#8901;O2&#8722; due to its strong built&#8208;in electric field (IEF). 1O2 directly dechlorinates polyvinyl chloride (PVC) due to the electro&#8208;negativity of chlorine atoms and the low dissociation energy of C&#8722;Cl bonds, while &#8901;O2&#8722; promotes direct dehydrogenation of polyethylene (PE) due to the electro&#8208;positivity of hydrogen atoms and the high dissociation energy of C&#8722;H bonds. This method is universally applicable to various single ROS systems. Installation experiments further affirm the application potential, achieving the highest diesel olefin production of 76.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Such a universally adaptive approach holds promise for addressing the global plastic pollution problem.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3+2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ConPET as a powerful and novel technique for photoredox catalysis has been first employed in asymmetric synthesis. In collaboration with chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis, an unprecedented redox&#8208;neutral [3+2] photocycloaddition has been developed, facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable azaarene&#8208;functionalized cyclopentyl ketones with high yields, ees and dr.







Abstract
Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3+2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X&#8208;Ray Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal&#8208;free perovskites, and reports on metal&#8208;free perovskites with a two&#8208;dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieved an ultra&#8208;low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (3D), HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 (2D) and HPIP3&#8722;NH4I7 (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 among metal&#8208;free single crystals&#8208;based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal-free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (3D), HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (2D) and HPIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X-ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; among metal-free single crystals-based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high-performance X-ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Streamlining the Generation of Advanced Polymer Materials Through the Marriage of Automation and Multiblock Copolymer Synthesis in Emulsion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated synthesis of a wide range of unique multicompositional multiblock copolymers via emulsion polymerization is described. These include a heptablock comprising seven different methacrylates, a high molecular weight (&gt;150,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) tridecablock, and a library of multiblock copolymers with randomized degrees of polymerization, composition, and monomer order. Notably, this library includes a multiblock copolymer containing polymers from four different families (methacrylate, styreme, acrylate, and acrylamide).







Abstract
Synthetic polymers are of paramount importance in modern life &#8208; an incredibly wide range of polymeric materials possessing an impressive variety of properties have been developed to date. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence and automation presents a great opportunity to significantly speed up discovery and development of the next generation of advanced polymeric materials. We have focused on the high&#8208;throughput automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers that comprise three or more distinct polymer segments of different monomer composition bonded in linear sequence. The present work has exploited automation to prepare high molar mass multiblock copolymers (typically&gt;100,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous emulsion. A variety of original multiblock copolymers have been synthesised via a Chemspeed robot, exemplified by a multiblock copolymer comprising thirteen constituent blocks. Moreover, libraries of copolymers of randomized monomer compositions (acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylates, and styrenes), block orders, and block lengths were also generated, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our synthetic approach. One multiblock copolymer contained all four monomer families listed in the pool, which is unprecedented in the literature. The present work demonstrates that automation has the power to render complex and laborious syntheses of such unprecedented materials not just possible, but facile and straightforward, thus representing the way forward to the next generation of complex macromolecular architectures.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Triggered Cascade Lactate Depletion by Semiconducting Polymer Nanoreactors for Cuproptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoreactor is developed to achieve sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion for cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. Upon ultrasound irradiation, this nanoreactor generates singlet oxygen to allow lactate oxidase release, leading to lactate depletion and hydrogen peroxide generation for promoting cuproptosis. This therapeutic strategy can observably restrict the growth of subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer.







Abstract
The high level of lactate in tumor microenvironment not only promotes tumor development and metastasis, but also induces immune escape, which often leads to failures of various tumor therapy strategies. We here report a sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion strategy by using semiconducting polymer nanoreactors (SPNLCu) for cancer cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. The SPNLCu mainly contain a semiconducting polymer as sonosensitizer, lactate oxidase (LOx) conjugated via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker and chelated Cu2+. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer generates singlet oxygen (1O2) to cut ROS&#8208;cleavable linker to allow the release of LOx that catalyzes lactate depletion to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The Cu2+ will be reduced to Cu+ in tumor microenvironment, which reacts with the produced H2O2 to obtain hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) that further improves LOx release via destroying ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. As such, sono&#8208;triggered cascade release of LOx achieves effective lactate depletion, thus relieving immunosuppressive roles of lactate. Moreover, the toxic Cu+ induces cuproptosis to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) for activating antitumor immunological effect. SPNLCu are used to treat both subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer with observably enhanced efficacy in restricting the tumor growths. This study thus provides a precise and effective lactate depletion tactic for cancer therapy.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Effect&#8208;Enabled Photocatalytic 4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Cyclization Cascade to Access Fluoroalkylated Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing fluoroalkylcyclobutanes is realized by photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. DFT calculations suggest that a fluorine effect, resulting from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the &#945;&#8208;selective radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates the uncommon 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are popular structural units in bioactive compounds and versatile intermediates in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging owing to high ring strain. In this study, a novel method for highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkylcyclobutanes bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters is realized by a photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a unique fluorine effect, arising from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the regio&#8208;reversed radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates an unprecedented 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure. This chemistry enables the direct and controllable construction of medicinally valuable quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing cyclobutanes from readily available raw materials, nicely complementing the existing methods.

         <title>Cover Picture: Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 30/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism for amine grafting in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402973). The image shows in a Warholian style how the adaptable response of the framework allows the rearrangement of pore windows necessary to enable the translocation and binding of tetraamines inside cavities that would otherwise be inaccessible. This behaviour is activated by the dynamic response of the heterometallic Ti2Ca2 clusters in MUV&#8208;10 in the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An alternative mechanism&lt;/b&gt; for amine grafting in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Carlos Mart&#237;-Gastaldo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202402973"&gt;e202402973&lt;/a&gt;). The image shows in a Warholian style how the adaptable response of the framework allows the rearrangement of pore windows necessary to enable the translocation and binding of tetraamines inside cavities that would otherwise be inaccessible. This behaviour is activated by the dynamic response of the heterometallic Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters in MUV-10 in the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules.

The radicals , in collaboration with water molecules, drive the breakage of V&#8208;F&#8208;V bonds in bulk phase phosphate and subsequently form a new 2D phosphate through recoordination, as reported by Xing&#8208;Long Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402371). The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na+ migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

A fluorine&#8208;free , dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized and used as a hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cells, as reported by Il&#8197;Seok Chae, Jong&#8197;Hak Kim et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202406796). The unique structure of the polymer chains led to the alignment of phase&#8208;separated domains and continuous proton channels were constructed throughout the membrane. This enabled efficient proton transport and ensured stable performance. A novel design of polymer structure demonstrates a promising prospect for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

Xiao et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of an ionic liquid (IL) additive in zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries, which serves to optimize Zn solvation and the anode interface, as well as aids in inhibiting polyiodide dissolution. The research findings reveal a capacity decay rate of 0.01&#8201;% per cycle over 18,000 cycles (4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in a full cell. Such promising results suggest a significant advancement in the field, offering high performing Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that, over time, lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et&#8197;al. recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) to an aqueous electrolyte and found that the IL plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmholtz plane,&#160;repelling H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8722;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01&#8201;% per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, is observed, making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanohoops: A New Generation of Curved Materials for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different nanohoops used to date in organic electronics are described in this Review. Through a structure&#8208;properties relationship study, the different performances reached are analysed and the potential of this new generation of curved materials discussed. This Review aims to stimulate future molecular designs of functional materials based on these conjugated macrocycles.







Abstract
Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems to form a hoop&#8208;shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15&#8197;years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arises from their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as host&#8211;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid&#8208;state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in a fluorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as a host in phosphorescent OLEDs or as charge transporter in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and in organic photovoltaics, this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These findings have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time has now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.

&lt;p&gt;The different nanohoops used to date in organic electronics are described in this Review. Through a structure-properties relationship study, the different performances reached are analysed and the potential of this new generation of curved materials discussed. This Review aims to stimulate future molecular designs of functional materials based on these conjugated macrocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;-conjugated systems to form a hoop-shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15&#8197;years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arises from their radially oriented &#960;-orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as host&#8211;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid-state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in a fluorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as a host in phosphorescent OLEDs or as charge transporter in organic field-effect transistors and in organic photovoltaics, this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These findings have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time has now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Linked Non&#8208;Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful atroposelective synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers marks a significant milestone in organic synthesis. Unlike conventional atropisomers, these unique molecules display generally lower enantiomerization barriers due to possible concerted bond rotations. Through innovative strategies, chemists have succeeded in controlling the atroposelectivity of these reactions, enabling the construction of original optically active molecular structures.







Abstract
Atropisomers hold significant fascination, not only for their prevalence in natural compounds but also for their biological importance and wide&#8208;ranging applications as chiral materials, ligands, and organocatalysts. While biaryl and heterobiaryl atropisomers are commonly studied, the enantioselective synthesis of less abundant heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers presents a formidable challenge in modern organic synthesis. Unlike classical atropisomers, these molecules allow rotation around two bonds, resulting in low barriers to enantiomerization through concerted bond rotations. In recent years the discovery of new configurationally stable rare non&#8208;biaryl scaffolds such as aryl amines, aryl ethers and aryl sulfones as well as innovative methodologies to control their configuration have been disclosed in the literature and constitute the topic of this minireview.

         <title>Reviving Cost&#8208;Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li2ZrCl6, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high&#8208;voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>A Gold(I)&#8211;Acetylene Complex Synthesised using Single&#8208;Crystal Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of &#960;&#8208;acetylene gold(I) compounds as intermediates in catalysis has been postulated, but their isolation or spectroscopic detection has remained elusive. Herein, the combination of a bulky cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine along with single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactivity allowed for the isolation of the first gold(I)&#8211;acetylene complex, which was thoroughly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR, periodic DFT, and electronic structure analyses.







Abstract
Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal solid/gas reactivity the gold(I) acetylene complex [Au(L1)(&#951;2&#8208;HC&#8801;CH)][BArF4] is cleanly synthesized by addition of acetylene gas to single crystals of [Au(L1)(CO)][BArF4] [L1=tris&#8208;2&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbiphenyl)phosphine, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3]. This simplest gold&#8208;alkyne complex has been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and periodic DFT. Bonding of HC&#8801;CH with [Au(L1)]+ comprises both &#963;&#8208;donation and &#960;&#8208;backdonation with additional dispersion interactions within the cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Hemicyanines as Modular Scaffolds for in vivo Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular chemical platform for the synthesis of targeted near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers including enzymatic cages and biocompatible units. We demonstrated its utility with the design of a cathepsin B&#8208;activatable agent for safe ablation of microtumors in vivo in a zebrafish preclinical model.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy is an anti&#8208;cancer treatment that requires illumination of photosensitizers to induce local cell death. Current near&#8208;infrared organic photosensitizers are built from large and non&#8208;modular structures that cannot be tuned to improve safety and minimize off&#8208;target toxicity. This work describes a novel chemical platform to generate enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers. We optimized the Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanine scaffold to include caging groups and biocompatible moieties, and generated cathepsin&#8208;triggered photosensitizers for effective ablation of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that enzyme&#8208;activatable Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanines are effective photosensitizers for the safe ablation of microtumors in vivo, creating new avenues in the chemical design of targeted anti&#8208;cancer photodynamic therapy agents.

         <title>Cascaded *CO&#8722;*COH Intermediates on a Nonmetallic Plasmonic Photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 with 90.6&#8201;% Selectivity</title>

The &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221;&#8208;stabilized W/Z plasmonic photocatalyst achieved efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion (653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221; strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi&#8208;electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that W/Z with OV enhances CO2 adsorption, activating *CO production, while reducing the energy barrier for *COH production (0.054&#8197;eV) and subsequent *CO&#8722;*COH coupling (0.574&#8197;eV). Successive hydrogenation revealed that the free energy for *CH2CH2 hydrogenation (0.108&#8197;eV) was lower than that for *CH2CH2 desorption for C2H4 production (0.277&#8197;eV), favouring C2H6 production. Consequently, W/Z achieves an efficient C2H6 activity of 653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%. This work offers a new strategy for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts with high selectivity for C2+ products.

         <title>Alkene 1,3&#8208;Difluorination via Transient Oxonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a diastereoselective hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers. The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under&#8208;explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.

Borylation and subsequent halide abstraction of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand affords a cationic complex featuring a rare linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes an unique chain elongation reaction via iminoborane carboration reaction with bis(tert&#8208;butyl)iminoborane, giving access to a five&#8208;atom B/N chain.







Abstract
Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.

         <title>Efficient Enzymatic Synthesis of Carbamates in Water Using Promiscuous Esterases/Acyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis performed under harsh reaction conditions often requires the need for protecting groups to prevent off&#8208;target reactions. While traditional chemical introduction of protecting groups disagrees with the principles of green chemistry, biocatalysis provides a promising alternative. Herein, we present an unprecedented enzymatic approach for the efficient synthesis of carbamate&#8208;protected amines in water achieving up to 99&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Biocatalysis provides an attractive approach to facilitate synthetic reactions in aqueous media. Motivated by the discovery of promiscuous aminolysis activity of esterases, we exploited the esterase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) for the synthesis of carbamates from different aliphatic, aromatic, and arylaliphatic amines and a set of carbonates such as dimethyl&#8208;, dibenzyl&#8208;, or diallyl carbonate. Thus, aniline and benzylamine derivatives, aliphatic and even secondary amines could be efficiently converted into the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)&#8208; or allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)&#8208;protected products in bulk water, with (isolated) yields of up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Selective Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides with an Ex Situ Gaseous Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that enables amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8208;aniline crosslinking by a minimalist linchpin strategy was used to form macrocyclic urea or carbamate products in unprotected peptides. The reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide range of other amino acids. Cyclization of bioactive cyclic peptides provided a variety of bicyclic peptides with novel topologies.







Abstract
Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking through a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal&#8208;mediated and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting&#8208;group strategies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking through a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal-mediated and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting-group strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped, Block&#8208;Graft Copolymer with Aligned Domains for High&#8208;Performance Hydrocarbon Polymer Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dumbbell&#8208;shaped hydrocarbon block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane. The introduction of comb&#8208;type side chains resulted in a highly aligned morphology with enhanced microphase separation. The poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(styrene sulfonic acid) membrane achieved outstanding ion conductivity and maintained stable fuel cell performance for 150&#8197;h.







Abstract
Given the environmental concerns surrounding fluoromaterials, the use of high&#8208;cost perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in fuel cells and water electrolysis contradicts the pursuit of clean energy systems. Herein, we present a fluorine&#8208;free dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer, derived from the cost&#8208;effective triblock copolymer, poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (SEBS), for polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs). This unique polymer shape led to the alignment of the hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic domains along a preferred orientation, resulting in the construction of interconnected proton channels across the membrane. A bicontinuous network allowed efficient proton transport with reduced tortuosity, leading to an exceptional ionic conductivity (249&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)), despite a low ion exchange capacity (IEC; 1.41). Furthermore, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with our membrane exhibited stable performance over a period of 150&#8197;h at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% RH. This study demonstrates a novel polymer structure design and highlights a promising outlook for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Progressive Optimization of Lanthanide Nanoparticle Scintillators for Enhanced Triple&#8208;Activated Radioluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressive optimization on lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators was performed to maximize their radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) emission intensity and reveal the underlying relationship between the scintillators&#8242; structure and RL efficiency. The results regarding the RL mechanism and in vivo multimodal imaging strongly indicated the significant potential of tailored LnNP scintillators to achieve seamlessly integrated tumor radio&#8208;phototheranostics.







Abstract
Lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators exhibit huge potential in achieving radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (radioluminescence, RL). However, their structure&#8211;activity relationship remains largely unexplored. Herein, progressive optimization of LnNP scintillators is presented to unveil their structure&#8208;dependent RL property and enhance their RL output efficiency. Benefiting from the favorable host matrix and the luminescence&#8208;protective effect of core&#8211;shell engineering, NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8201;%Eu@NaLuF4 nanoparticle scintillators with tailored structures emerged as the top candidates. Living imaging experiments based on optimal LnNP scintillators validated the feasibility of laser&#8208;free continuous RL activated by clinical radiopharmaceuticals for tumor multiplex visualization. This research provides unprecedented insights into the rational design of LnNP scintillators, which would enable efficient energy conversion from Cerenkov luminescence, &#947;&#8208;radiation, and &#946;&#8208;electrons into visible photon signals, thus establishing a robust nanotechnology&#8208;aided approach for tumor&#8208;directed radio&#8208;phototheranostics.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Formation of Sulfurous Acid (H2SO3) in the Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laboratory experiments show the formation of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) from the gas&#8208;phase reaction of OH radicals with CH3S(O)OH for atmospheric reaction conditions with a molar yield of &#8764;50&#8201;%. H2SO3 represents a hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach acid that has never been observed in aqueous solution. In the gas phase, if once formed, it shows a certain kinetic stability with an estimated lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric water vapor conditions.







Abstract
Sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is known to be thermodynamically instable decomposing into SO2 and H2O. All attempts to detect this elusive acid in solution failed up to now. Reported H2SO3 formation from an experiment carried out in a mass spectrometer as well as results from theoretical calculations, however, indicated a possible kinetic stability in the gas phase. Here, it is shown experimentally that H2SO3 is formed in the OH radical&#8208;initiated gas&#8208;phase oxidation of methanesulfinic acid (CH3S(O)OH) at 295&#177;0.5&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar of air with a molar yield of 

53-17+7

 ${{53}_{-17}^{+\ 7}}$



&#8201;%. Further main products are SO2, SO3 and methanesulfonic acid. CH3S(O)OH represents an important intermediate product of dimethyl sulfide oxidation in the atmosphere. Global modeling predicts an annual H2SO3 production of &#8764;8&#8197;million metric tons from the OH+CH3S(O)OH reaction. The investigated H2SO3 depletion in the presence of water vapor results in k(H2O+H2SO3) &lt;3&#215;10&#8722;18&#8197;cm3&#8201;molecule&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which indicates a lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric humidity. This work provides experimental evidence that H2SO3, once formed in the gas phase, is kinetically stable enough to allow its characterization and subsequent reactions.
