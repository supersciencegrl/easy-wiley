         <title>Hyperpolarization of 15N&#8208;Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on 13C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of 15N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported 15N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced 15N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para&#8208;hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H2O2 level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H2O2 probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H2O2 and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N signal detection. The present work manifests its great potential not only for reaction based reactive sensing probes but also promises to serve as a platform to develop other contrast agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic&#160;Framework with Donor1&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor2 Motifs Regulating Local Charge of Intercalated Single Cobalt Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance. Herein, intercalated single Co sites coordinated by imine&#8208;N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties via a molecular engineering strategy. It is confirmed that the charge delivery property and local charge distribution of these heterometallic frameworks can be profoundly influenced by electronic structures. Among these featured structures with mixed&#8208;state copper clusters, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) ratio by changing various bipyridines. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structures facilitate the formation of a highly separated electron&#8208;hole state, which effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from dual electron donors to Co centers, achieving an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. This work opens up an avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Induced Interstitial Effects Drive Water Oxidation on Ordered Ir&#8208;B Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir&#8208;B compounds (IrB1.1)&#160;with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir&#8208;B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B&#8208;induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces Oncosis for Synergistic Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An optimal cancer chemotherapy regimen should effectively address the drug resistance of tumors while eliciting antitumor&#8208;immune responses. Research has shown that non&#8208;apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis&#160;and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP&#8208;ribose polymerase 1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca2+ ions and increased expression of Calpain 1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain 1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis&#8208;associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis facilitates the maturation of dendritic cells and the awakening of adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also induces the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) towards an M1 phenotype and activates the innate immune response of TAMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamidation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Azides: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic protocol to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under mild conditions. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) pathway in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical.







Abstract
The construction of C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds via direct N&#8208;centered radical addition with olefins under benign conditions is a desirable but challenging strategy. Herein, we describe an organo&#8208;photocatalytic approach to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. A broad range of substrates, including both activated and unactivated alkenes, are suitable for this protocol, providing a convenient and practical method to construct sulfonylamide derivatives. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests that the additive, Hantzsch ester (HE), might undergo a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer manner to achieve photosensitization by the organo&#8208;photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Next, the resulted triplet excited state 3HE* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C4&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, the addition of the amidyl radical to alkene followed by HAT from p&#8208;toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.

         <title>Linkage Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic C2H4 Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are constructed by linkage engineering to efficiently catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalytic array structure composed of sp3 N sites in the aminal linkages promotes CO2 capture and enhances the reaction kinetics for C2H4 production, thus showing a much higher Faraday efficiency of C2H4 than imine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1&#8201;%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Selective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyridines and Isoquinolines through Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated pyridines are prepared via bench stable oxazino pyridine intermediates with unsymmetrical iodonium salts using Cu&#8208;catalysis. The strategy can be applied for meta&#8208;alkenylation upon simply switching to the corresponding alkenyl I(III) reagents and both C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalizations also work on isoquinolines.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization offers an efficient strategy for the synthesis of various elaborated N&#8208;containing heteroarenes. Along these lines, oxazino pyridines that can be readily prepared from pyridines, have been introduced as powerful substrates in radical&#8208; and ionic&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. However, the regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines remains a great challenge. Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines and isoquinolines through bench&#8208;stable dearomatized intermediates is reported. Electrophilic aryl&#8208;Cu(III) species, generated from readily accessible aryl I(III) reagents, enable the efficient meta&#8208;arylation of a broad range of pyridines and isoquinolines. The method also allows the meta&#8208;selective alkenylation of these heteroarenes using the corresponding alkenyl I(III)&#8208;reagents. Late&#8208;stage arylation of drug&#8208;derived pyridines and larger&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C 3 N 4 &#160;Triggers Selective H 2 O 2 &#160;Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz&#160;orbitals to&#160;overlap laterally,&#160;thus forming&#160;&#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose&#160;a strategy to promote localized electron&#160;polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets.&#160;The introduction of sulfur (S)&#160;further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling,&#160;thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes&#160;electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4&#160;exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95%)&#160;and achieves a superb H2O2&#160;production rate,&#160;approaching&#160;4374.8&#160;ppm during&#160;continuous electrolysis&#160;over 300&#8208;hour. According to theoretical&#160;calculation&#160;and in&#8208;situ&#160;spectroscopy,&#160;the ortho&#8208;S configuration&#160;can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in&#160;carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressed Dissolution of Fluorine&#8208;rich SEI Enables Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes for Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is a critical challenge for the zinc metal anodes, leading to an erratic electrode/electrolyte interface and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ultimately resulting in anode failure. This study uncovers that the fluorine species dissolution is the root cause of SEI instability. To effectively suppress the F&#8208; dissolution, an introduction of low&#8208;polarity molecule, 1,4&#8208;thioxane (TX), is proposed, which reinforces the stability of the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Moreover, the TX molecule has a strong affinity for coordinating with Zn2+ and adsorbing at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby diminishing the activity of local water and consequently impeding SEI dissolution. The robust fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer promotes the high durability of the zinc anode in repeated plating/stripping cycles, while concurrently suppressing HER and enhancing Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the Zn||KVOH full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention, averaging 6.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 with 98% retention after 400 cycles, even at high loading with a lean electrolyte. This work offers a novel perspective on SEI dissolution as a key factor in anode failure, providing valuable insights for the electrolyte design in energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A general descriptor for single&#8208;atom catalysts decorated with axial ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decoration of an axial coordination ligand (ACL) on the active metal site is a highly effective and versatile strategy to tune activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the regulation mechanism of ACLs on SACs is still incompletely known. Herein, we investigate diversified combinations of ACL&#8208;SACs, including all 3d&#8208;5d transition metals and ten prototype ACLs. We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8208;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Through examination of various local configurations and intrinsic parameters of ACL&#8208;SACs, a general structure descriptor &#963; is constructed to quantify the structure&#8208;activity relationship of ACL&#8208;SACs which solely based on a few key intrinsic features. Importantly, we also identified the axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL, as a part of &#963;, which can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps (RLS) of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment. And we predicted several ACL&#8208;SACs, namely, CrN4&#8208;, FeN4&#8208;, CoN4&#8208;, RuN4&#8208;, RhN4&#8208;, OsN4&#8208;, IrN4&#8208; and PtN4&#8208;ACLs, that entail markedly higher activities than the benchmark catalysts of Pt and IrO2, thereby supporting that the general descriptor &#963; can provide a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to assess efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is able to convert nitrate (NO3&#8208;) into reusable ammonia (NH3), offering a green treatment and resource utilization strategy of nitrate wastewater and ammonia synthesis. The conversion of NO3&#8208; to NH3 undergoes water dissociation to generate active hydrogen atoms and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation tandemly. The two relay processes compete for the same active sites, especially under pH&#8208;neutral condition, resulting in the suboptimal efficiency and selectivity in the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8208;. Herein, we constructed a Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst by anchoring Cu single atoms on amorphous iron oxide shell of nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) for the electrochemical NO3RR, achieving an impressive NO3&#8208; removal efficiency of 94.8% and NH3 selectivity of 99.2% under neutral pH and nitrate concentration of 50 mg L&#8208;1 NO3&#8208;&#8208;N conditions, greatly surpassing the performance of nZVI counterpart. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8208; adsorption on Fe sites and strengthened water activation on single&#8208;atom Cu sites, decreasing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH. This work develops a novel strategy of fabricating dual&#8208;site catalysts to enhance the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8208;, and presents an environmentally sustainable approach for neutral nitrate wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Screening of Alternative DNA Base&#8208;Organic Molecule&#8208;Base Architectures via Integrated Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecule&#8208;mediated noncanonical DNA self&#8208;assembly expands the standard DNA base&#8208;pairing alphabets. However, only a very limited number of small molecules have been recognized as mediators because of the tedious and complicated experiments like crystallization and microscopy imaging. Here we present an integrative screening protocol incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) for fast theoretical simulation and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for convenient experimental validation. Melamine, the molecule that was confirmed mediating noncanonical DNA base&#8208;pairing, and 38 other candidate molecules were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol. We successfully identified seven stable noncanonical DNA duplex structures, and another eight novel structures with sub&#8208;stability. In addition, we discovered that hairpins at both ends can significantly stabilize the noncanonical DNA structures, providing a guideline to design small organic molecule&#8208;incorporated DNA structures. Such an efficient screening protocol will accelerate the design of alternative DNA&#8208;molecule architectures beyond Watson&#8208;Crick pairs. Considering the wide range of potential mediators, it will also facilitate applications such as noncovalent, highly dense loading of drug molecules in DNA&#8208;based delivery system and probe design for sensitive detection of certain molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of a CC unit with an isoelectronic BN unit in aromatic systems can give rise to molecules and materials with fascinating properties. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole species, 2, featuring an unprecedented 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic BN&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that is isoelectronic to cyclopentadienide (Cp&#8722;). Bearing an unsymmetrical B=B entity, 2 exhibits reactivity toward oxidants, protic reagents, electrophiles, and unsaturated substrates. This reactivity facilitates the synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and bicyclic organoboron derivatives through mechanisms including ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion. These findings reveal innovative synthetic routes to BN&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds via desymmetrization, affording unique building blocks for synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors. Compared to [12]CPP, D&#8208;A nanohoop exhibited significant changes in physical properties, including a large redshift (&gt; 78 nm) in the fluorescence spectrum and novel positive solvatofluorochromic properties with a maximum peak ranging from 484 nm to 546 nm. The potential applications of [12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices were further investigated, and its bipolar behavior as a charge transport active layer was clearly observed.</dc:description>

         <title>New Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Layered Double Perovskite Halides: Synthesis, Structural Transition and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized three new hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs) with general formula (R'/R'')4/2M(III)M(I)Cl8; where R' = C3H7NH3 (i.e. 3N) and R'' = NH3C4H8NH3 (i.e. 4N4); M(III) = In3+ or Ru3+; M(I) = Cu+ by simple solution&#8208;based acid precipitation method. The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)2CuInCl8 and (4N4)2CuRuCl8 adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)4CuInCl8 exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure.&#160;Three compounds show temperature&#8208;dependent structural phase transition where change in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (kL) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300 K range, originating from the distorted crystal structures and soft lattice. The RP&#8208;HLDP compound, (3N)4CuInCl8, demonstrates anisotropy in kL while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow kL of 0.15 Wm&#8208;1K&#8208;1 at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb&#8208;free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow kL in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity within the complex crystal structure, coupled with the presence of low&#8208;energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat&#8208;carrying acoustic phonons.</dc:description>

         <title>Photogeneration of Chlorine Radical from a Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorous 4CzIPN&#8226;Chloride Complex: Application in C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorous photoredox catalyst 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN (Rf8=C8F17) forms a supramolecular complex with chloride ions with high affinity. Integrating fluorous chains on the parent dye greatly enhances both the ion&#8208;binding affinity, as well as the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Efficient photooxidation of the chloride was observed, generating the chlorine HAT reagent, which was tested in the redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reaction.







Abstract
The chlorine radical is a strong HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) agent that is very useful for the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Albeit highly attractive, its generation from the poorly oxidizable chloride ion mediated by an excited photoredox catalyst is a difficult task. We now report that 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN, an electron&#8208;deficient fluorous derivative of the benchmark 4CzIPN photoredox catalyst belonging to the donor&#8208;acceptor carbazole&#8208;cyanoarene family, is not only a better photooxidant than 4CzIPN, but also becomes an excellent host for the chloride ion. Combining these two properties ultimately makes the self&#8208;assembled 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN&#8226;Cl&#8722; dual catalyst highly reactive in redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reactions promoted by the chlorine radical. Additionally, because of its fluorous character, the efficient separation/recovery of 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN could be envisioned.

Iminium stencil. A cyclometallated imide exhibits a unique mode of action serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines. A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop the most selective and active catalysts described to date for the direct hydrogenation of this challenging class of substrates with up to 99&#8201;% ee and 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF.







Abstract
A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop overall the most selective catalyst for the direct hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl imines described to date. Iridium catalysts with a cyclometallated cyclic imide group provide selectivity of up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Computational studies show that the selectivity results from the combined effect of H&#8208;bonding of the imide C=O with the substrate iminium ion and a stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with the cyclometallated ligand. The cyclometallated ligand thus exhibits a unique mode of action, serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate which results in enhanced selectivity. The catalyst (2) has been synthesized and isolated as a crystalline air&#8208;stable solid. X&#8208;ray analysis of 2 confirmed the structure of the catalyst and the correct position of the imide C=O groups to engage in an H&#8208;bond with the substrate. 19F&#8197;NMR real&#8208;time monitoring showed the hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines catalyzed by 2 is very fast, with a TOF of approx. 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Efficient Ultraviolet Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Cerium Bromides</title>

An effective strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;CPL is proposed by constructing Ce3+&#8208;based 0D chiral HMHs. R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 show large |glum| values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2 and FM values of (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which is superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL active materials. The UV CP light from the fabricated CP&#8208;LEDs can trigger enantioselective photopolymerizations of diacetylene and yield polymerized products with anisotropy factors of CD up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2.







Abstract
Ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (UV&#8208;CPL) with high photon energy shows great potential in polarized light sources and stereoselective photopolymerization. However, developing luminescent materials with high UV&#8208;CPL performance remains challenging. Here, we report a pair of rare earth Ce3+&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7, which exhibits characteristic UV emissions derived from the Ce 5d&#8211;4f transition. The compounds show simultaneously high photoluminescent quantum yields of (32&#8211;39)% and large luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum|) values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2. Thus, the figures of merits of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 are calculated to be (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which are superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL emissive materials. Additionally, nearly 91&#8201;% of their PL intensities at 300&#8197;K can be well preserved at 380&#8197;K (LED operating temperature) without phase transition or decomposition, demonstrating the excellent structural and optical thermal stabilities of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7. Based on these enantiomers, the fabricated UV&#8208;emitting CP&#8208;LEDs exhibit high polarization degrees of &#177;1.0&#8201;%. Notably, the UV&#8208;CPL generated from the devices can significantly trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene with remarkable stereoselectivity, and consequently yield polymerized products with the anisotropy factors of circular dichroism (gCD) up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2, outperforming other UV&#8208;CPL materials and demonstrating their great potential as UV&#8208;polarized light sources.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Enables Flexible&#8208;Robust Porosity for Highly Efficient Purification of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel flexible&#8208;robust HOF material with abundant supramolecular entanglements by weak intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds, enabling the construction of flexible&#8208;robust porosity to be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules for notably improving the C3H8/CH4 and n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 separation performance.







Abstract
The development of porous materials with flexible&#8208;robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a) with flexible&#8208;robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a features a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure with dia topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so&#8208;called flexible&#8208;robust framework). The flexible&#8208;robust porosity of ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules rather by C2H6 and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6 over CH4 under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 selectivities. The gas&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n&#8208;C4H10 can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n&#8208;C4H10 uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6 adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible&#8208;robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.

         <title>Blue Long Afterglow and Ultra Broadband Vis&#8208;NIR Emission from All&#8208;Inorganic Copper&#8208;Doped Silver Halide Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of copper(I) ions into all&#8208;inorganic Rb2AgBr3 single crystals achieves ultralong blue afterglow (&gt;300&#8197;s) by manipulating the formation of bromine vacancies. Moreover, this doping strategy enables a cascade of energy transfer among distinct emission centers, resulting in near&#8208;unity&#8208;yield white light emission and extending the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic metal halides with afterglow emission have attracted increasing attention due to their significantly longer afterglow duration and higher stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their afterglow colors have not yet reached the blue spectral region.

     alt="Blue Long Afterglow and Ultra Broadband Vis-NIR Emission from All-Inorganic Copper-Doped Silver Halide Single Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of copper(I) ions into all-inorganic Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals achieves ultralong blue afterglow (&amp;gt;300&#8197;s) by manipulating the formation of bromine vacancies. Moreover, this doping strategy enables a cascade of energy transfer among distinct emission centers, resulting in near-unity-yield white light emission and extending the emission into the near-infrared region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-inorganic metal halides with afterglow emission have attracted increasing attention due to their significantly longer afterglow duration and higher stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their afterglow colors have not yet reached the blue spectral region. Here, we report all-inorganic copper-doped Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals with ultralong blue afterglow (&amp;gt;300&#8197;s) by modulating defect states through doping engineering. The introduction of copper(I) ions into Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates the formation of bromine vacancies, thus increasing the density of trap states available for charge storage and enabling bright, persistent emission after ceasing the excitation. Moreover, cascade energy transfer between distinct emissive centers in the crystals results in ultra-broadband photoluminescence, not only covering the whole white light with near-unity quantum yield but also extending into the near-infrared region. This &#8216;cocktail&#8217; of exotic light-emission properties, in conjunction with the excellent stability of copper-doped Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals, allowed us to demonstrate their implementation to solid-state lighting, night vision, and intelligent anti-counterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry with On&#8208;Paper Electrokinetic Manipulations: Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Trillion Detection of Per/Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Water and Opioids in Urine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paper&#8208;based device that combines electrokinetic stacking and separations with MS ionization is developed to enable trace analysis without prior sample preparation. Sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection of harmful per/polyfluoroalkyl substances from tap water in 10&#8197;minutes is demonstrated.







Abstract
We developed a simple, paper&#8208;based device that enables sensitive detection by mass spectrometry (MS) without solid phase extraction or other sample preparation. Using glass fiber filter papers within a 3D printed holder, the device employs electrokinetic manipulations to stack, separate, and desalt charged molecules on paper prior to spray into the MS. Due to counter&#8208;balanced electroosmotic flow and electrophoresis, charged analytes stack on the paper and desalting occurs in minutes. One end of the paper strip was cut into a sharp point and positioned near the inlet of a MS. The stacked analyte bands move toward the paper tip with the EOF where they are ionized by paper spray. The device was applied to analysis of PFAS in tap water with sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection limits in less than ten minutes with no sample pretreatment. Analysis of opioids in urine also occurs in minutes. The crucial parameters to enable stacking, separation, and MS ionization of both positively and negatively charged analytes were determined and optimized. Experimental and computational modeling studies confirm the electrokinetic stacking and analyte transport mechanisms. On&#8208;paper separations were carried out by stacking analyte bands at different locations depending on their electrophoretic mobility, achieving baseline separation in some cases.

         <title>Detection of Sulfoquinovosidase Activity in Cell Lysates Using Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of activity&#8208;based probes targeting the active site nucleophile of glycoside hydrolase family&#8197;31 sulfoquinovosidases is described. The probes are shown to bind covalently by structural biology, mass spectrometry and Cy5 in&#8208;gel fluorescence, are selective for sulfoquinovosidases in whole bacterial cell lysates, and are used to monitor active levels of enzyme over time.







Abstract
The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY&#8208;family&#8197;31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of Bacillus megaterium SQase. A fluorescent Cy5&#8208;probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin&#8208;probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5&#8208;probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT&#8208;qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.

         <title>An Expedient Radical Approach for the Decarboxylative Synthesis of Stereodefined All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;based, photo&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative formation of stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins is reported using various &#945;&#8208;amino radical precursors and heterocycles as substrates. This user&#8208;friendly protocol combines a wide structural scope, easy drug and postsynthetic manipulations, and variation in both reaction partners. The mechanistic studies reveal a key CO2 extrusion step to enable the overall transformation.







Abstract
We report a user&#8208;friendly approach for the decarboxylative formation of stereodefined and complex tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted olefins from vinyl cyclic carbonates and amines as radical precursors. The protocol relies on easy photo&#8208;initiated &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;radical formation followed by addition onto the double bond of the substrate resulting in a sequence involving carbonate ring&#8208;opening, double bond relay, CO2 extrusion and finally O&#8208;protonation. The developed protocol is efficient for both mismatched and matched polarity substrate combinations, and the scope of elaborate stereodefined olefins that can be forged including drug&#8208;functionalized derivatives is wide, diverse and further extendable to other types of heterocyclic and radical precursors. Mechanistic control reactions show that the decarboxylation step is a key driving force towards product formation, with the initial radical addition under steric control.

         <title>One&#8208;Component Cationic Lipids for Systemic mRNA Delivery to Splenic T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that predominantly target the liver and possess complex constituents, we designed simplified one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipid/mRNA nanoparticles (CLNs) for extrahepatic mRNA delivery. These CLNs facilitated mRNA expression in the spleen and T cells, demonstrating substantial potential for immunotherapy applications.







Abstract
Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non&#8208;liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine&#8208;based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications. This straightforward strategy extends the utility of lipid family for extrahepatic mRNA delivery, offering new insights into vector development beyond LNPs to further the field of precise mRNA therapy.

The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;activated organic photothermal agent that synchronously enables satisfying NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging is highly warranted yet rather challenging on the basis of the overwhelming nonradiative decay. Herein, such an agent, namely TPABT&#8208;TD, was tactfully designed and constructed via employing benzo[c]thiophene moiety as bulky electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge and tailoring the peripheral molecular rotors. Benefitting from its high electron donor&#8211;acceptor strength and finely modulated intramolecular motion, TPABT&#8208;TD simultaneously exhibits ultralong absorption in NIR&#8208;II region, intense fluorescence emission in the NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) region as nanoaggregates, and high photothermal conversion upon 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Those intrinsic advantages endow TPABT&#8208;TD nanoparticles with prominent fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy against orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor with negligible adverse effect.

         <dc:description>
Temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) provides the improvement in the utilization rate of the photon budget in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) SMLM imaging through single&#8208;wavelength, wide&#8208;field, and axially&#8208;confined two&#8208;photon excitation of spontaneously blinking fluorophores and reveals the 3D distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits in the brain tissue of a transgenic mouse of Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) based on temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation (TFMPE) and single&#8208;wavelength excitation is used to visualize the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distribution of spontaneously blinking fluorophore&#8208;labeled subcellular structures in a thick specimen with a nanoscale&#8208;level spatial resolution. To eliminate the photobleaching effect of unlocalized molecules in out&#8208;of&#8208;focus regions for improving the utilization rate of the photon budget in 3D SMLM imaging, SMLM with single&#8208;wavelength TFMPE achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation (TPE) of spontaneously blinking fluorophores. TPE spectral measurement of blinking fluorophores is then conducted through TFMPE imaging at a tunable excitation wavelength, yielding the optimal TPE wavelength for increasing the number of detected photons from a single blinking event during SMLM. Subsequently, the TPE fluorescence of blinking fluorophores is recorded to obtain a two&#8208;dimensional TFMPE&#8208;SMLM image of the microtubules in cancer cells with a localization precision of 18&#177;6 nm and an overall imaging resolution of approximately 51&#8197;nm, which is estimated based on the contribution of Nyquist resolution and localization precision. Combined with astigmatic imaging, the system is capable of 3D TFMPE&#8208;SMLM imaging of brain tissue section of a 5XFAD transgenic mouse with the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, revealing the distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;beta peptide deposits.

         <title>Organometallic Chirality Sensing via &#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;Like &#951;6&#8208;Arene Coordination with an Achiral Cp*Ru(II) Piano Stool Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with a readily available ruthenium piano stool complex and its use in an optical CD/UV relay assay allow time&#8208;efficient chromatography&#8208;free stereochemical analysis of a broad range of challenging molecules.







Abstract
Piano stool complexes have been studied over many years and found widespread applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, materials and drug development. We now report the first examples of quantitative chiroptical molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with readily available half sandwich complexes. This conceptually new approach to chirality sensing is based on irreversible acetonitrile displacement of [Cp*Ru(CH3CN)3]PF6 by an aromatic target molecule, a process that is fast and complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The metal coordination coincides with characteristic circular dichroism inductions that can be easily correlated to the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio of the bound molecule. A relay assay that decouples the determination of the enantiomeric composition and of the total sample amount by a practical CD/UV measurement protocol was developed and successfully tested. The introduction of piano stool complexes to the chiroptical sensing realm is mechanistically unique and extends the scope of currently known methods with small&#8208;molecule probes that require the presence of amino, alcohol, carboxylate or other privileged functional groups for binding of the target compound. A broad application range including pharmaceutically relevant multifunctional molecules and the use in chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis are also demonstrated.

         <title>Discovery of (&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes Reveals an Unusual Indole Ring Cleavage Pathway Catalyzed by P450 Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel enantiomeric natural indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton were isolated from a mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus. The cytochrome P450 enzyme was identified to catalyze the C2&#8722;C3 double bond cleavage of indole ring to generate products with two keto groups during the biosynthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactam indole terpenoids. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase.







Abstract
(&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes A&#8722;D (1&#8211;4), the first representatives of indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton, were isolated from the mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus Penicillium brocae MA&#8208;231. Our bioactivity tests revealed their potent antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The biosynthetic reactions by the five enzymes PbaABCDE leading to &#947;&#8208;lactam ring formation were identified with heterologous expression and in vitro enzymatic assays. Remarkably, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PbaB and its homolog in Aspergillus oryzae catalyzed the 2,3&#8208;cleavage of the indole ring to generate two keto groups in 1. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase. In addition, rare secondary amide bond formation by the glutamine synthetase&#8208;like enzyme PbaD was reported. These findings will contribute to the engineered biosynthesis of unnatural, bioactive indole terpenoids.

         <title>Conjugation and Topology Engineering of 2D &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Robust Potassium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of the application of conjugation and topology engineering to regulate the cation/anion storage feature of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, which presents robust framework structure and successive storage of cations/anions, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in potassium&#8208;ion half/full cells.







Abstract
The evolution of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) provides a significant prospect for researching the next generation of green and advanced energy storage systems (ESSs). Especially, conjugation and topology engineering serve as an irreplaceable character in adjusting the electrochemical properties of ESSs. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy using conjugation and topology engineering to demonstrate the application of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in robust potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) for the first time. By comparing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, the rhombus structure (sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF) cathode for PIBs can display the impressive electrochemical performance, including a high specific discharge capacity of 178.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a well long&#8208;term cycle stability of more than 9,000 (at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, full PIBs (FPIBs) are constructed by pairing sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF cathode with dipotassium terephthalate (KTP) anode, which delivers a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 146.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and great practical application prospect. These findings provide reasonable implications for the design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs from the perspective of conjugation and topology engineering for advanced energy storage systems.

By comparing 2D c-MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four-arm core, the rhombus structure (sql-Cu-TBA-MOF) cathode for PIBs can display the impressive electrochemical performance, including a high specific discharge capacity of 178.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a well long-term cycle stability of more than 9,000 (at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, full PIBs (FPIBs) are constructed by pairing sql-Cu-TBA-MOF cathode with dipotassium terephthalate (KTP) anode, which delivers a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 146.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and great practical application prospect. These findings provide reasonable implications for the design of 2D c-MOFs from the perspective of conjugation and topology engineering for advanced energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Sensor Based on Steric Hindrance Regulated Molecular Packing for In Vivo Epilepsy Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescence sensing mechanism is presented by using steric hindrance quenchers to regulate the molecular packing state of fluorophores. The ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice brain is visualized by the SHINE sensor.







Abstract
Fluorescence sensing is crucial to studying biological processes and diagnosing diseases, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window with reduced background signals. However, it's still a great challenge to construct &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensors when the sensing wavelength extends into the NIR&#8208;II region to obtain higher imaging contrast, mainly due to the difficult synthesis of spectral overlapped quencher. Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quencher (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQs can competitively pack with fluorophores and prevent their self&#8208;aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensing method is achieved via bio&#8208;analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely the Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy. As a proof of concept, the ClO&#8722;&#8208;sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR&#8208;II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real&#8208;time visualization of ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice.

         <title>Catalytic Refining Lignin&#8208;derived Monomers: Seesaw Effect between Nanoparticle and Single&#8208;Atom Pt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt automatically adsorbed on oxygen vacancy of TiO2 via an in&#8208;situ interfacial redox reaction, resulting in atomically dispersion of Pt on TiO2.In the upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived 4&#8208;propylguaiacol, single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2&#8208;H achieved a conversion of 96.9% and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3% under 3 MPa H2 at 250 &#176;C for 3 h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0%. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2&#8208;H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2&#8208;H reduced the energy barrier of CAr&#8211;OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single&#8208;atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2&#8208;H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin&#8208;derived monomers and high stability.This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil&#8208;based 4&#8208;alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived monomers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is reported using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles (f&#8208;AuNPs) with alkylthiols acting as the catalyst only upon mild thermal activation.

The combined experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that f&#8208;AuNPs is inactive at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state, catalyst activation occurs rapidly at mild temperatures (~ 70 &#176;C) and the doping reaction completes in few seconds affording large electrical conductivities (~ 10 &#8211; 140 S cm&#8208;1). The implementation of this methodology enables the use of semiconductor+dopant+catalyst solutions, will broaden the use of the corresponding n&#8208;doped films in opto&#8208;electronic devices such as thin&#8208;film transistors, electrochemical transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectrics well as guide the design of new catalysts</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Unique Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Titanium Dioxide Supported Platinum Clusters for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial to modulating the nature of metal species, yet the SMSI behaviors of sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters remain unknown due to the difficulties in constructing SMSI at cluster scale. Herein, we achieve the successful construction of the SMSI between Pt clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets by vacuum annealing, which required a relatively low temperature that avoids the aggregation of small clusters. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy observation is employed to explore the SMSI behaviors, and the results reveal the dynamic rearrangement of Pt atoms upon annealing for the first time. The originally disordered Pt atoms become ordered as the crystallizing of the amorphous TiO2 support, forming an epitaxial interface between Pt and TiO2. Such SMSI state can remain stable in oxidation environment even at 400 &#176;C. Further investigations prove that the electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt occupies the Pt 5d orbitals, which is responsible for the disappeared CO adsorption ability of Pt/TiO2 after forming SMSI. This work not only opens a new avenue for constructing SMSI at cluster scale but also provides in&#8208;depth understanding on the unique SMSI behavior, which would stimulate the development of supported metal clusters for catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triphenylamine[3]arenes: Streamlining Synthesis of a Versatile Macrocyclic Platform for Supramolecular Architectures and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylamine[3]arenes (TPA[3]s), featuring [16]paracyclophane backbone with alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, were synthesized through a BF3&#183;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction using triphenylamine derivatized monomers and paraformaldehyde. This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron&#8208;donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three&#8208;fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of chiral hydrogels from thermoresponsive helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers (PPAs) carrying three&#8208;fold dendritic oligoethylene glycols (OEGs) is reported. Three different temperatures, i.e. below or above cloud point temperatures (Tcps) of the copolymers, and under freezing condition, were utilized, affording thermoresponsive hydrogels with different morphologies and mechanical properties. At room temperature, transparent hydrogels were obtained through crosslinking among different copolymer chains. Differently, opaque hydrogels with much improved mechanical properties were formed at elevated temperatures through crosslinking from the thermally dehydrated and collapsed copolymer aggregates, leading to heterogeneity for the hydrogels with highly porous morphology. While crosslinking at freezing temperature synergistically through ice templating, these amphiphilic dendronized copolymers formed hydrogels with highly porous lamellar structures, which exhibited remarkable compressible properties as human articular cartilage with excellent fatigue resistance. Amphiphilicity of the dendronized copolymers played a pivotal role in modulating the network formation during the gelation, as well as morphology and mechanical performance of the resulting hydrogels. Through crosslinking, these dendronized copolymers featured with typical dynamic helical conformations were transformed into hydrogels with unprecedently stabilized helicities due to the restrained chain mobilities in the three&#8208;dimensional networks.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fabrication of chiral hydrogels from thermoresponsive helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers (PPAs) carrying three-fold dendritic oligoethylene glycols (OEGs) is reported. Three different temperatures, i.e. below or above cloud point temperatures (Tcps) of the copolymers, and under freezing condition, were utilized, affording thermoresponsive hydrogels with different morphologies and mechanical properties. At room temperature, transparent hydrogels were obtained through crosslinking among different copolymer chains. Differently, opaque hydrogels with much improved mechanical properties were formed at elevated temperatures through crosslinking from the thermally dehydrated and collapsed copolymer aggregates, leading to heterogeneity for the hydrogels with highly porous morphology.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Methyl Carbodithioate Esters as Effective Gold Contact Groups for Single&#8208;Molecule Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are several binding groups used within molecular electronics for anchoring molecules to metal electrodes (e.g., R&#8211;SMe, R&#8211;NH2, R&#8211;CS2&#8722;, R&#8211;S&#8722;). However, some anchoring groups that bind strongly to electrodes have poor/unknown stability, some have weak electrode coupling, while for some their binding motifs are not well defined. Further binding groups are required to aid molecular design and to achieve a suitable balance in performance across a range of properties. We present an in&#8208;depth investigation into the use of carbodithioate esters as contact groups for single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, using scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction measurements (STM&#8208;BJ) and detailed surface spectroscopic analysis. We demonstrate that the methyl carbodithioate ester acts as an effective contact for gold electrodes in STM&#8208;BJ measurements. Surface enhanced Raman measurements demonstrate that the C=S functionality remains intact when adsorbed on to gold nanoparticles. A gold(I) complex was also synthesised showing a stable C=S&#1476;&#8594;AuI interaction from the ester. Comparison with a benzyl thiomethyl ether demonstrates that the C=S moiety significantly contributes to charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions. The overall performance of the CS2Me group demonstrates it should be used more extensively and has strong potential for the fabrication of larger area devices with long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a new strategy that rapidly and reliably incorporates bromine atoms at distal, secondary C(sp3)&#8211;H sites in aliphatic amines with excellent and predictable site&#8208;selectivity pattern.

         <title>Controlling the Orientation&#8208;Dependent Second Harmonic Generation in Hybrid Germanium Perovskite Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the crystal orientation plays a crucial role in the conversion efficiency during second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we provide a new strategy in controlling the surface&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG with the precise design of (101) and (20) MAGeI3 facets. Based on the SHG measurement, the (101) MAGeI3 single crystal exhibits larger SHG (1.3 &#215; (20) MAGeI3). Kelvin probe force microscopy imaging shows a smaller work function for the (101) MAGeI3 compared with the (20), which indirectly demonstrates the stronger intrinsic polarization on the (101) surface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the band bending within the (101) facet. Temperature&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy show shorter lifetime and wider emission band in the (101) MAGeI3 single crystal, revealing the higher defect states. Additionally, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns show the (101) MAGeI3 possesses larger in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8208; density, which could directly enhance the spontaneous polarization in the (101) facet. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further demonstrates the higher intrinsic polarization in the (101) facet compared with the (20) facet, and the larger built&#8208;in electric field in the (101) facet facilitates surface vacancy defect accumulation. Our work provides a new angle in tuning and optimizing hybrid perovskite&#8208;based nonlinear optical materials.</dc:description>

While substantial advances have been achieved over decades, these rearrangements remained applicable exclusively to parent 1,5&#8208;hexadienes.

Detailed mechanistic investigations including several control experiments, cross&#8208;over experiment, HRMS analysis, 31P NMR and DFT studies have been performed to underpin the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Covalent Polymers through Carbodiimide&#8208;driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical systems make use of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine&#8208;tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinitiated Transient Self&#8208;Assembly in a Catalytically Driven Chemical Reaction Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically&#8208;fueled chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are key in controlling dissipative self&#8208;assembly. A key challenge in the field is to store chemical fuel&#8208;precursors or &#8220;pre&#8208;fuels&#8221; in the system that are catalytically converted into activating or deactivating fuels that drive the CRN. In addition, real&#8208;time control over such catalysis by light is highly desirable, but so far not yet achieved. Here we show a catalytically&#8208;driven CRN that is photoinitiated with 450 nm light, producing activated monomers that go on to perform transient self&#8208;assembly. Monomer activation proceeds via photoredox catalysis, converting the monomer alcohol groups into the corresponding aldehydes that self&#8208;assemble into large supramolecular fibers. Monomer deactivation is achieved by organometallic catalysis that relies on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release formate (i.e., the deactivating fuel). Additionally, irradiation with 305 nm light accelerates the release of formate by photo&#8208;uncaging the pre&#8208;fuel, leading to a factor ~2 faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light photoactivation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.</dc:description>

         <title>Are Redox&#8208;active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4'&#8208;oligo[n]methylene&#8208;bipyridinium assemblies (with n = 2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state Z = +2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra&#8208;molecular orbitals (supra&#8208;MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive s bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for Z = +2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that all&#8208;trans and folded conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one&#8208;electron injection, for radical cations (Z = +1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra&#8208;MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra&#8208;MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (Z = 0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins Enabled by 1,4&#8208;Cyano Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration. This approach can be applied to homopolymerize &#945;&#8208; substituted styrenes or acrylates. As a chain transfer agent, a symmetric allylic sulfide is created to regulate the propagating thiyl radicals over the polymerization process.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Olefins are valued and abundant building blocks from fossil resources. They are widely used to provide small&#8208;molecule or polymeric products. Despite numerous advantages of radical polymerization, it has been well&#8208;documented as textbook knowledge that &#945;&#8208;olefins and their functionalized derivatives cannot be radically homopolymerized because of the degradative chain transfer side reactions. Herein, we report our studies on the homopolymerization of thiocyanate functionalized &#945;&#8208;olefins enabled by 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration under radical conditions. By this approach, a library of ABC sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with high molecular weights can be prepared. We can also extend this strategy to the homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;substituted styrenic and acylate monomers which are known to be challenging to achieve. Overall, the demonstrated functional group migration radical polymerization could provide new possibilities to synthesize polymers with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures. These polymers are promising candidates for novel polymeric materials.

         <title>Umbrella&#8208;Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally multi&#8208;alkylated aromatic micelles are assembled in water from umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles featuring a linear alkyl chain flanked by two polyaromatic panels. The alkylation strongly enhances the stability of the novel micelles against dilution and heat. Notably, thanks to the softness of the fully alkyl&#8208;filled cavity, efficient uptake of large metallodyes and pseudorotaxane&#8208;like binding of cycloparaphenylenes is achieved.







Abstract
To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8211;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups). The amphiphiles quantitatively assemble into spherical micelles (~2&#8211;3&#8197;nm in core diameter), possessing an alkylated cavity surrounded by a polyaromatic framework, in water. The alkylation significantly enhances the stability of the micellar structures against dilution (up to 9&#8197;&#956;M) and heat (up to &gt;120&#8201;&#176;C). The highly condensed hexadecyl core of the hybrid micelle, as indicated by solvatochromic guest probes, displays increased uptake ability toward large alkylated metallodyes. Interestingly, efficient uptake of aromatic macrocycles (i.e., [n]cycloparaphenylenes) by the present micelle provides pseudorotaxane&#8208;shaped host&#8211;guest composites with high emissivity (&#934;F=up to 35&#8201;%). Internal multi&#8208;alkylation of an aromatic micelle can thus successfully enhance its assembly stability/guest uptake functions.

         <title>A Hybrid Orbitrap&#8208;Nanoelectromechanical Systems Approach&#160;to Analysis of Individual, Intact Proteins in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)&#8208;based mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technique that enables determination of the mass of individual adsorbed particles, by driving nanomechanical devices at resonance and monitoring the real&#8208;time changes in their resonance frequencies induced by each single molecule adsorption event. We incorporate NEMS into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and report our progress towards leveraging the single&#8208;molecule capabilities of the NEMS to enhance the dynamic range of conventional MS instrumentation and to offer new capabilities for performing deep proteomic analysis of clinically relevant samples. We use the hybrid instrument to deliver&#160;E. coli&#160;GroEL molecules (801 kDa) to the NEMS devices in their native, intact state. Custom ion optics are used to focus the beam down to 40 &#181;m diameter with a maximum flux of 25 molecules/second. The mass spectrum obtained with NEMS&#8208;MS shows good agreement with the known mass of GroEL.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Coffee&#8208;ring Nanostructured Membranes for Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross&#8208;flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n&#8208;hexane, coffee&#8208;ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~ 13 LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfiguring the Hydrogen Networks of Aqueous Electrolyte to Stabilize Iron Hexacyanoferrate for High&#8208;Voltage Decoupled Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as insertion&#8208;type cathodes have attracted significant attention in various aqueous batteries to accommodate metal or non&#8208;metal ions while suffering from serious dissolution and consequent inferior lifespan. Herein, we reveal that the dissolution of PBAs primarily originates from the locally elevated pH of electrolytes that are caused by proton co&#8208;insertion during discharge. To address this issue, a water&#8208;locking electrolyte (WLE) has been strategically implemented, which interrupts the generation and Grotthuss diffusion of protons by breaking the well&#8208;connected hydrogen bonding network in aqueous electrolytes. As a result, the WLE enables the iron hexacyanoferrate to endure over 1000 cycles at a 1C rate and supports a high&#8208;voltage decoupled cell with an average voltage of 1.95 V. These findings provide insights for mitigating dissolution problems in electrode materials, thereby enhancing the viability and performance of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>piSTING: A Pocket&#8208;Independent Agonist Based on Multivalency&#8208;Driven STING Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent therapeutic target for innate immunity. Despite the efforts to develop pocket&#8208;dependent small&#8208;molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING&#8208;based vaccine combination with aPD&#8208;1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Modulation of Ag&#8208;Imidazole Cuboctahedral Cage Microenvironments for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X= NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1%(acidic), 94.1%(neutral) and 95.3% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8208;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.</dc:description>

         <title>Triply Interlocked [2]catenanes: Rational Synthesis, Reversible Conversion Studies and Unprecedented Application in Photothermal Responsive Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triply interlocked [2]catenane complexes featuring two identical, mechanically interlocked units are extraordinarily rare chemical compounds, whose properties and applications remain open to detailed studies. Herein, we introduce the rational design of a new ligand precursor, L1, suitable for the synthesis of six triply interlocked [2]catenanes by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The interlocked compounds can be reversibly converted into the corresponding simple triangular prism metallacage by addition of H2O or DMF solvents to their CH3OH&#160;solutions, thereby demonstrating the importance of &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions in the formation of triply interlocked [2]catenanes. Moreover, extensive studies have been conducted to assess the remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Complex 6a, exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance (conversion efficiency in solution : 31.82%), is used to prepare novel photoresponsive elastomer in combination with thermally activated liquid crystal elastomer. The resultant material displays robust response to near&#8208;infrared&#160;(NIR)&#160;laser and the capability of completely reforming the shape and reversible actuation, paving the way for the application of half&#8208;sandwich organometallic units in photo&#8208;responsive smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetal&#8208;thiol Click&#8208;like Reaction: Facile and Efficient Synthesis of Dynamic Dithioacetals and Recyclable Polydithioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithioacetals are heavily used in organic, material and medical chemistries, and exhibit huge potential to synthesize degradable or recyclable polymers. However, the current synthetic approaches of dithioacetals and polydithioacetals are overwhelmingly dependent on external catalysts and organic solvents. Herein, we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction for synthesizing dithioacetals and polydithioacetals. High conversion, higher than acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, can be achieved. High universality was confirmed by monitoring the reactions of linear and cyclic acetals (including renewable bio&#8208;sourced furan&#8208;acetal) with aliphatic and aromatic thiols, and the reaction mechanism of monomolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and auto&#8208;protonation (activation) by thiol was clarified by combining experiments and density functional theory computation. Subsequently, we utilize this reaction to synthesize readily recyclable polydithioacetals. By simple heating and stirring, linear polydithioacetals with w of ~110 kDa were synthesized from acetal and dithiol, and depolymerization into macrocyclic dithioacetal and repolymerization into polydithioacetal can be achieved; through reactive extrusion, a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer dynamic network with excellent mechanical properties and continuous reprocessability was prepared from poly(vinyl butyral) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). This green and high&#8208;efficient synthesis method for dithioacetals and polydithioacetals is beneficial to the sustainable development of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers may suffer from sudden mechanical damages during long&#8208;term use under various harsh operating environments. Rapid and real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing will extend their service life, which is particularly attractive in the context of circular economy. In this work, a lignin cluster polymerization strategy (LCPS) was designed to prepare a series of lignin functionalized polyolefin composites with excellent mechanical properties through nickel catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene and lignin cluster monomers. These composites can also achieve rapid self&#8208;healing within 30 seconds under a variety of extreme usage environments (underwater, seawater, extremely low temperatures as low as &#8208;60 &#176;C, organic solvents, acid alkali solvents, etc.), which is of great significance for real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing of sudden mechanical damage. More importantly, the dynamic cross&#8208;linking network within these composites enable great re&#8208;processability and amazing sealing performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Hydrogenation in Concentrated Seawater at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene (E&#8208;AHE) is a promising alternative for thermal&#8208;catalytic process, yet it suffers from low current densities and efficiency. Here, we achieved a 71.2% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of E&#8208;AHE at a large partial current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 using concentrated seawater as an electrolyte, which can be recycled from the brine waste (0.96 M NaCl) of alkaline seawater electrolysis (ASE). Mechanistic studies unveiled that cation of concentrated seawater dynamically prompted unsaturated interfacial water dissociation to provide protons for enhanced E&#8208;AHE. As a result, compared with freshwater, a twofold increase of FE of E&#8208;AHE was achieved on concentrated seawater&#8208;based electrolysis. We also demonstrated an integrated system of ASE and E&#8208;AHE for hydrogen and ethylene production, in which the obtained brine output from ASE was directly fed into E&#8208;AHE process without any further treatment for continuously cyclic operations. This innovative system delivered outstanding FE and selectivity of ethylene surpassed 97.0% and 97.5% respectively across wide&#8208;industrial current density range (&#8804; 0.6 A cm&#8722;2). This work provides a significant advance of electrocatalytic ethylene production coupling with brine refining of seawater electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D compounds exfoliated from weakly bonded bulk materials with van der Waals (vdW) interaction are easily accessible. However, the strong internal ionic/covalent bonding of most inorganic crystal frameworks greatly hinders 2D material exfoliation. Herein, we first proposed a radical/strain&#8208;synergistic strategy to exfoliate non&#8208;vdW interacting pseudo&#8208;layered phosphate framework. Specifically, hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) distort the covalent bond irreversibly, meanwhile, H2O molecules as solvents, further accelerating interlayered ionic bond breakage but mechanical expansion. The innovative 2D laminar NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystal, exfoliated by &#8226;OH/H2O synergistic strategy, exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity, high&#8208;rate performance (85.7 mA h g&#8208;1 at 20 C), cyclic life (2300 cycles), and ion migration rates, compared with the bulk framework. Importantly, this chemical/physical dual driving technique realized the effective exfoliation for strongly coupled pseudo&#8208;layered frameworks, which accelerates 2D functional material development.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Neutral H2O2 Electrosynthesis from Favorable Reaction Microenvironments via Porous Carbon Carrier Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) in neutral media is undoubtedly a practical route, but the limited comprehension of electrocatalysts has hindered the system advancement. Herein, we present the design of model catalysts comprising mesoporous carbon spheres&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for H2O2 electrosynthesis at near&#8208;zero overpotential with approximately 95% selectivity in a neutral electrolyte. Impressively, the optimized Pd/MCS&#8208;8 electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 15.77 mol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, generating a neutral H2O2 solution with an accumulated concentration of 6.43 wt.%, a level sufficiently high for medical disinfection. Finite element simulation and experimental results suggest that mesoporous carbon carriers promote O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8208; ORR in neutral media. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the robust interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the carbon carriers optimized the adsorption of OOH* at the carbon edge, ensuring high active 2e&#8208; process. These findings offer new insights into carbon&#8208;loaded electrocatalysts for efficient 2e&#8208; ORR in neutral media, emphasizing the role of carrier engineering in constructing favorable microenvironments and synergizing active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Access to Organostibines via Selective Organic Superbase Catalyzed Antimony&#8208;Carbon Protonolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bonds via organic superbase catalysis under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions is reported. This novel approach utilizes electron&#8208;deficient stibine, Sb(C6F5)3, to give upon base&#8208;catalyzed reactions with weakly acidic aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons access to a range of new aromatic and heteroaromatic stibines, respectively, with loss of C6HF5. Also, the significantly less electron&#8208;deficient stibines, Ph2SbC6F5 and PhSb(C6F5)2 smoothly underwent base&#8208;catalyzed exchange reactions with a range of terminal alkynes to generate the stibines of formulae PhSb(C&#8801;CPh)2, and Ph2SbC&#8801;CR [R = C6H5, C6H4&#8208;NO2, COOEt, CH2Cl, CH2NEt2, CH2OSiMe3, Sb(C6H5)2], respectively. These formal substitution reactions proceed with high selectivity as only the C6F5 groups serve as a leaving group to be liberated as C6HF5 upon formal proton transfer from the alkyne. Kinetic studies of the base&#8208;catalyzed reaction of Ph2SbC6F5 with phenyl acetylene to form Ph2SbC&#8801;CPh and C6HF5 suggested the empirical rate law to exhibit a first&#8208;order dependence with respect to the base catalyst, alkyne and stibine. DFT calculations support a pathway proceeding via a concerted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis transition state, where the base catalyst activates the Sb&#8208;C6F5 bond sequence through secondary bond interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dialumene&#8208;Mediated Production of Phosphines through P4 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation and further functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) by main group complexes has become an increasingly studied topic in recent times. Herein, we report the controlled formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries from the selective reaction of P4 with dialumenes, ([L(IiPr)Al]2) (1: L = Tripp; 2: L = tBu2MeSi; IiPr = {MeCN(iPr)}2C)). The two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction product of P4 features a P42&#8208; structure and is shown to be able to act as a source of P3&#8208;. Treatments of different electrophiles (e.g., chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl), iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI), HCl, or acetyl chloride (CH3COCl)) with these phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes under mild conditions gave the corresponding phosphine (e.g., P(SiMe3)3, PH3, or P(COCH3)).</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoinvertive SN1 Through Neighboring Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neighboring group participation, the assistance of non&#8208;conjugated electrons to a reaction center, is a fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. In the framework of nucleophilic substitution reactions, neighboring group participation is known to cause rate acceleration, first order kinetics (SN1), and retention of configuration. The latter phenomenon is a result of double inversion: the first one when the neighboring group displaces the leaving group, and the second when a nucleophile substitutes the neighboring group. This powerful control of stereoretention has been widely used in organic synthesis for more than a century. However, neighboring group participation may also lead to inversion of configuration, a phenomenon which is often overlooked. Herein, we review this unique mode of stereoinversion, dividing the relevant reactions into three classes with the aim to introduce a fresh perspective on the different modes of stereoinversion via neighboring group participation as well as the factors that control this stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Based Multimeric Aptamer Generation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimeric aptamers have gained more attention than their monomeric counterparts due to providing more binding sites for target analytes, leading to increased affinity. This work attempted to engineer the surface&#8208;based generation of multimeric aptamers by employing the room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique and chemically modified primers for developing a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor. The multimeric aptamers, generated through surface RCA, are hybridized to modified spacer primers, facilitating the positioning of the aptamers in the proximity of sensing surfaces. These multimeric aptamers can be used as bio&#8208;receptors for capturing specific targets. The surface amplification process was fully characterized, and the optimal amplification time for biosensing purposes was determined, using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SP). Interestingly, multimeric aptasensors produced considerably higher response signals and affinity (more than 10&#8208;fold), as well as higher sensitivity (almost 4&#8208;fold) compared to monomeric aptasensors. Furthermore, the impact of surface structures on the response signals was studied by utilizing both flat working electrodes (WEs) and nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) WEs. The NMIs multimeric aptasensors showed significantly higher sensitivity in buffer and saliva media with the limit of detection less than 2 fg/ml. Finally, the developed NMIs multimeric aptasensors were clinically challenged with several saliva patient samples.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs)&#160;have gained significant interest and have been rapidly developed in flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) in recent years. However, ensuring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;OSCs while retaining ideal mechanical properties remains an enormous challenge. The fracture strain (FS) value of typical high&#8208;efficiency blend films is generally less than 8%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end&#8208;capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53%) and flexible (17.03%) OSCs, along with excellent FS values (16.59%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding FS values of 25.18% and 12.3% were achieved by P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl &#8208;based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end&#8208;capped MCD&#8208;based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600 mAh g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated S/CNTs|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6% at 0.2 C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in&#8208;situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. &#160;The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8208; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5 C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6 mAh g&#8208;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5 C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3 mAh g&#8208;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Radical and Cationic Single&#8208;Unit Monomer Insertions for Engineering Polymer Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;unit monomer insertion (SUMI), derived from living/controlled polymerization, can be directly functionalized at the end or within the chain of polymers prepared by living/controlled polymerization, offering potential applications in the preparation of polymers with complex architectures. Many scenarios demand the simultaneous incorporation of monomers suitable for different polymerization methods into complex polymers. Therefore, it becomes imperative to utilize SUMI technologies with diverse mechanisms, especially those that are compatible with each other. Here, we reported the orthogonal SUMI technique, seamlessly combining radical and cationic SUMI approaches. Through the careful optimization of monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and adjustments to reaction conditions, we can efficiently execute both radical and cationic SUMI processes in one pot without mutual interference. The utilization of orthogonal SUMI pairs facilitates the integration of radical and cationic reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various configurations. This flexibility enables the synthesis of diblock, triblock, and star polymers that incorporate both cationically and radically polymerizable monomers. Moreover, we have successfully implemented a mixing mechanism of free radicals and cations in RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization, resulting in the creation of a side&#8208;chain sequence&#8208;controlled polymer brushes.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite Membranes for High&#8208;Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis conditions range significantly constrains scale&#8208;up preparation. Herein, we proposed a facile interzeolite conversion approach using FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3 &#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24 ~ 96 h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#160;MPa feed pressure and 303 K, the membranes showed an average CO2 permeance of (5.2 &#177; 0.5) &#215; 10&#8208;7 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1&#183;Pa&#8208;1 (1530&#160;GPU), with an average CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity of 143 &#177; 7. Minimal defects ensure a high selectivity of 126 with a CO2 permeation flux of 0.4 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1 at 6.1&#160;MPa feed pressure, far surpassing requirements for industrial applications. The feasibility for successful scale&#8208;up of our approach was further demonstrated by the batch synthesis of 40 cm&#8208;long hollow fiber SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite membranes exhibiting CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity up to 400 (0.2 MPa feed pressure and 303 K) without using sweep gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to Ethanol via Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Defected Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8208;N2 Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper,&#160;we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol, delivering 69.8 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with the DFT calculation, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its unique defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration. Firstly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in Cu+/Cu2+ dual valence states, although predominantly in Cu+. The Cu+ sites support CO2 activation and the Cu+/Cu2+ sites are conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8208;C coupling. Secondly, the Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V are rich in electrons and thus highly active. Together they dictate the rate&#8208;determining step on CO2 photoreduction to ethanol and lower the Gibbs free energy change. Furthermore, the defected configuration also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also reveals the valence state change of Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during the CO2 photoreduction reaction.</dc:description>

This study also reveals the valence state change of Cu in Cu-N2-V during the CO2 photoreduction reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric 1,n&#8208;Remote Aminoacetoxylation of Unactivated Internal Alkenes Enabled by Palladium Catalysis**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium &#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed using PhI(OAc)2 as oxidant, providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 with a tert&#8208;butyl group in oxazoline ring and propyl group in C6 position of pyridinyl is vital for the reaction, where the former is good for asymmetric aminopalladation step and the latter for the chain walking process. The enantioenriched lactam products were proven to be good building blocks for the synthesis of azabicycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Thiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unexpectedly facile dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy enolsilanes, providing sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts, are reported. A total of fifteen thiophene substrates have been found to undergo (4+3) cycloaddition smoothly to produce endo and exo (4+3) adducts in yields of up to 83% with moderate to good diastereoselectivity. Complete conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when the optically enriched epoxide was used. The desulfurizing transformations of the sulfur&#8208;bridged skeleton of the cycloadducts provide functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks consisting of 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadiene subunits. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these (4+3) cycloadditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials.

The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8210;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Pure Covalent Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self&#8208;assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (trans&#8208;CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo&#8208;chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |glum| up to 7 &#215; 10&#8722;3, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds&#160;Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8208;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8208;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500 hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170 mAh g&#8208;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;State Control over Supramolecular Chirality through Dynamic Chemistry Mediated Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic chemistry utilizing both covalent and noncovalent bonds provides valid protocols in manipulating properties of self&#8208;assemblies and functions. Here we employ dynamic chemistry to realize multiple&#8208;route control over supramolecular chirality up to five states. N&#8208;protected fluorinated phenylalanine in the carboxylate state self&#8208;assembled into achiral nanoparticles ascribed to the amphiphilicity. Protonation promoted one&#8208;dimensional growth into helices with shrunk hydrophilicity, which in the presence of disulfide pyridine undergo chirality inversion promoted by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;directed coassembly. Further interacting with the water&#8208;soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five&#8208;state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

Further interacting with the water-soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five-state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclooctatetraene&#8208;Embedded Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>

Molecular Nanorings Featuring Hoop&#8208;Shaped Segments of Carbon Schwarzites. We describe three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings (COTCNRs) which can be recognized as hoop&#8208;shaped segments of distinctive carbon schwarzites. COTCNR3 complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) and forms one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular wires with ambient electrical conductivities of up to (7.11&#177;0.14)&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
With the prosperity of the development of carbon nanorings, certain topologically or functionally unique units&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings have sprung up in the past decade. Herein, we report the facile and efficient synthesis of three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings (COTCNRs) that contain three (COTCNR1 and COTCNR2) and four (COTCNR3) COT units in a one&#8208;pot Yamamoto coupling. These nanorings feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of Gyroid (G&#8208;), Diamond (D&#8208;), and Primitive (P&#8208;) type carbon schwarzites. The conformations of the trimeric nanorings COTCNR1 and COTCNR2 are shape&#8208;persistent, whereas the tetrameric COTCNR3 possesses a flexible carbon skeleton which undergoes conformational changes upon forming host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70), whose co&#8208;crystals may potentially serve as fullerene&#8208;based semiconducting supramolecular wires with electrical conductivities on the order of 10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (for C60&#8834;COTCNR3) and 10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (for C70&#8834;COTCNR3) under ambient conditions. This research not only describes highly efficient one&#8208;step syntheses of three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings which feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of distinctive topological carbon schwarzites, but also demonstrates the potential application in electronics of the one&#8208;dimensional fullerene arrays secured by COTCNR3.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Cephalotaxus Diterpenoids and Their Structural Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified synthetic approach inspired by biosynthesis is presented for producing three subgroups of cephalotaxus diterpenoids. By selectively introducing carbon atoms and expanding rings, cephalotane&#8208;type C18 dinorditerpenoids can be transformed into troponoid&#8208;type C19 norditerpenoids and intact cephalotane&#8208;type C20 diterpenoids. Several natural products, including fortalpinoid C and cephanolide E, were successfully synthesized.







Abstract
Herein, we present a unified chemical synthesis of three subgroups of cephalotaxus diterpenoids. Key to the success lies in adopting a synthetic strategy that is inspired by biosynthesis but is opposite in nature. By employing selective one&#8208;carbon introduction and ring expansion operations, we have successfully converted cephalotane&#8208;type C18 dinorditerpenoids (using cephanolide B as a starting material) into troponoid&#8208;type C19 norditerpenoids and intact cephalotane&#8208;type C20 diterpenoids. This synthetic approach has enabled us to synthesize cephinoid H, 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;cephinoid H, 7&#8208;oxo&#8208;cephinoid H, fortalpinoid C, 7&#8208;epi&#8208;fortalpinoid C, cephanolide E, and 13&#8208;epi&#8208;cephanolide E. Furthermore, through the development of an intermolecular asymmetric Michael reaction between &#946;&#8208;oxo esters and &#946;&#8208;substituted enones, we have achieved the enantioselective synthesis of advanced intermediates within our synthetic sequence, thus formally realizing the asymmetric total synthesis of the cephalotaxus diterpenoids family.

         <title>Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin free&#8208;standing porous aromatic framework (PAF) membranes were prepared by liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization, and applied in the anion conduction for the first time, with excellent performance in hydroxide conductivity and stability due to the rational presence of transporting sites and rigid structure of PAF.







Abstract
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) show promising potential in anionic conduction due to their high stability and customizable functionality. However, the insolubility of most PAFs presents a significant challenge in their processing into membranes and subsequent applications. In this study, continuous PAF membranes with adjustable thickness were successfully created using liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization. The rigid backbone and the stable C&#8722;C coupling endow PAF membrane with superior chemical and dimensional stabilities over most conventional polymer membranes. Different quaternary ammonium functionalities were anchored to the backbone through flexible alkyl chains with tunable length. The optimal PAF membrane exhibited an OH&#8722; conductivity of 356.6&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. Additionally, the PAF membrane exhibited outstanding alkaline stability, retaining 95&#8201;% of its OH&#8722; conductivity after 1000&#8197;hours in 1&#8197;M NaOH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of PAF materials in anion exchange membranes, achieving the highest OH&#8722; conductivity and exceptional chemical/dimensional stability. This work provides the possibility for the potential of PAF materials in anionic conductive membranes.

         <title>A Minimalistic Covalent Bond&#8208;Forming Chemical Reaction Cycle that Consumes Adenosine Diphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials that consume chemical energy are fundamental to the development of synthetic active matter, yet the complexity of their reaction cycles hinders understanding how energy is used. The creation of a fully characterised minimalistic metabolic cycle based on the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) driven assembly of building blocks has allowed insight to be gained into the way energy is dissipated by the network and uncover general design principles for driven systems.







Abstract
The development of synthetic active matter requires the ability to design materials capable of harnessing energy from a source to carry out work. Nature achieves this using chemical reaction cycles in which energy released from an exergonic chemical reaction is used to drive biochemical processes. Although many chemically fuelled synthetic reaction cycles that control transient responses, such as self&#8208;assembly, have been reported, the generally high complexity of the reported systems hampers a full understanding of how the available chemical energy is actually exploited by these systems. This lack of understanding is a limiting factor in the design of chemically fuelled active matter. Here, we report a minimalistic synthetic responsive reaction cycle in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) triggers the formation of a catalyst for its own hydrolysis. This establishes an interdependence between the concentrations of the network components resulting in the transient formation of the catalyst. The network is sufficiently simple that all kinetic and thermodynamic parameters governing its behaviour can be characterised, allowing kinetic models to be built that simulate the progress of reactions within the network. While the current network does not enable the ADP&#8208;hydrolysis reaction to populate a non&#8208;equilibrium composition, these models provide insight into the way the network dissipates energy. Furthermore, essential design principles are revealed for constructing driven systems, in which the network composition is driven away from equilibrium through the consumption of chemical energy.

While the current network does not enable the ADP-hydrolysis reaction to populate a non-equilibrium composition, these models provide insight into the way the network dissipates energy. Furthermore, essential design principles are revealed for constructing driven systems, in which the network composition &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; driven away from equilibrium through the consumption of chemical energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exploring New Paths for Solar Energy Storage: A Win&#8208;Win Approach for rGO/CdS to Improve the Energy Conversion Efficiency and Stability of Integrated Photorechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries.







Abstract
Integrating solar energy into rechargeable battery systems represents a significant advancement towards sustainable energy storage solutions. Herein, we propose a win&#8208;win solution to reduce the shuttle effect of polysulfide and improve the photocorrosion stability of CdS, thereby enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of rGO/CdS&#8208;based photorechargeable integrated lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PRLSBs). Experimental results show that CdS can effectively anchor polysulfide under sunlight irradiation for 20&#8197;minutes. Under a high current density (1&#8197;C), the discharge&#8208;specific capacity of the PRLSBs increased to 971.30&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 113.3&#8201;% enhancement compared to that of under dark condition (857.49&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Remarkably, without an electrical power supply, the PRLSBs can maintain a 21&#8197;hours discharge process following merely 1.5&#8197;hours of light irradiation, achieving a breakthrough solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion efficiency of up to 5.04&#8201;%. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman analysis corroborate the effectiveness of this complementary weakness approach in bolstering redox kinetics and curtailing polysulfide dissolution in PRLSBs. This work showcases a feasible strategy to develop PRLSBs with potential dual&#8208;functional metal sulfide photoelectrodes, which will be of great interest in future&#8208;oriented off&#8208;grid photocell systems.

         <title>Cyclopropenes as Chemical Reporters for Dual Bioorthogonal and Orthogonal Metabolic Labeling of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual biorthogonal and orthogonal metabolic labeling of genomic DNA in HeLa cells was demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl&#8208;tetrazine dye conjugate and the photoclick reaction with a pyrene&#8208;tetrazole using isomeric cyclopropenes as chemical reporters.







Abstract
Dual bioorthogonal labeling enables the investigation and understanding of interactions in the biological environment that are not accessible by a single label. However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross&#8208;reactivity. We developed a pair of differently modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcyclopropenyl&#8208;modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest&#8208;reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions. Their orthogonal reactivity could be evidenced in vitro. Primer extension experiments were performed with both 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines investigating their replication properties as substitutes for thymidine and evaluating subsequent labeling reactions on the DNA level. Finally, dual, orthogonal and metabolic fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA was demonstrated in HeLa cells. An experimental procedure was developed combining intracellular transport and metabolic DNA incorporation of the two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines with the subsequent dual bioorthogonal labeling using a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl tetrazine and a fluorogenic pyrene&#8208;tetrazole. These results are fundamental for advanced metabolic labeling strategies for nucleic acids in the future, especially for live cell experiments.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) can enhance dipole moment and induce more positive surface electrostatic potential, contributing to the compact and diverse molecular stacking, thus promoting exciton delocalization for efficient charge generation. Besides, AHS suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination loss and enabling PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 to yield the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V.







Abstract
High open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem devices and indoor photovoltaics. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide band gap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.232&#8197;V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02&#8201;%, Voc=1.197&#8197;V). Notably, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and Voc, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.

         <title>Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of protein templates in artificial enzyme design is illustrated through genetic code expansion. Incorporation of a secondary amine into the nucleotide&#8208;binding DHFR and multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR resulted in catalytic entities, with the former favoring the use of NADPH as the hydride source for reactions, whereas the latter required biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH).







Abstract
Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N&#8208;terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. In this study, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR and nucleotide&#8208;binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D&#8208;proline moiety demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro&#8208;R hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r. up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis. Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR&#8208;based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.

Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR-based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimerized Acceptors with Conjugate&#8208;Break Linker Enable Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling connecting sites and halogen substitutions, four dimerized acceptors were designed and synthesized. Thanks to the modification of molecular structure, a champion efficiency of 18.07&#8201;% was achieved in FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid devices. Importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based intrinsically stretchable devices achieved high performance (power conversion efficiency=14.29&#8201;%) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain=18.23&#8201;%).







Abstract
Designing new acceptors is critical for intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) with high efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, nearly all stretchable polymer acceptors exhibit limited efficiency and high&#8208;performance small molecular acceptors are very brittle. In this regard, we select thienylene&#8208;alkane&#8208;thienylene (TAT) as the conjugate&#8208;break linker and synthesize four dimerized acceptors by the regulation of connecting sites and halogen substitutions. It is found that the connecting sites and halogen substitutions considerably impact the overall electronic structures, aggregation behaviors, and charge transport properties. Benefiting from the optimization of the molecular structure, the dimerized acceptor exhibits rational phase separation within the blend films, which significantly facilitates exciton dissociation while effectively suppressing charge recombination processes. Consequently, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid OSCs render the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.07&#8201;% among reported acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linker. Most importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based IS&#8208;OSCs achieve high PCE (14.29&#8201;%) and remarkable stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS]=18.23&#8201;%), significantly surpassing Y6&#8208;based counterpart (PCE=12.80&#8201;% and COS=8.50&#8201;%). To sum up, these findings demonstrate that dimerized acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linkers have immense potential in developing highly efficient and mechanically robust OSCs.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Allysine for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach was developed for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of the side chain of dimethyl lysine. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and modifies dimethyl lysine and tertiary amines to form aldehydes in small molecules, peptides, proteins and cells.







Abstract
Inspired by the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which selectively converts the side chain of lysine into allysine, an aldehyde&#8208;containing post&#8208;translational modification, we report herein the first chemical method for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of dimethyl lysine. This approach is highly chemoselective for dimethyl lysine on proteins. We highlight the utility of this biomimetic approach for generating aldehydes in a variety of pharmaceutically active linear and cyclic peptides at a late stage for their diversification with various affinity and fluorescent tags. Notably, we utilized this approach for generating small&#8208;molecule aldehydes from the corresponding tertiary amines. We further demonstrated the potential of this approach in generating cellular models for studying allysine&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Responsive Anionophores with AND Logic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform for accessing stimuli&#8208;responsive anionophores, triggered by multiple stimuli of biological relevance including light, redox, and an esterase, is reported, and accessed via post&#8208;synthetic modification of a dynamic hydrogen bonding anionophore. By utilizing two different cages, a responsive anionophore with AND logic activation, requiring two different stimuli, was achieved.







Abstract
Artificial ion transport systems have emerged as an important class of compounds that promise applications in chemotherapeutics as anticancer agents or to treat channelopathies. Stimulus&#8208;responsive systems that offer spatiotemporally controlled activity for targeted applications remain rare. Here we utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4,6&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;isophthalamide core to generate a modular platform enabling access to stimuli&#8208;responsive ion transporters that can be activated in response to a wide variety of external stimuli, including light, redox, and enzymes, with excellent OFF&#8208;ON activation profiles. Alkylation of the two free hydroxyl groups with stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties locks the amide bonds through intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hence makes them unavailable for anion binding and transport. Triggering using a particular stimulus to cleave both cages reverses the hydrogen bonding arrangement, to generate a highly preorganized anion binding cavity for efficient transmembrane transport. Integration of two cages that are responsive to orthogonal stimuli enables multi&#8208;stimuli activation, where both stimuli are required to trigger transport in an AND logic process. Importantly, the strategy provides a facile method to post&#8208;functionalize the highly active transporter core with a variety of stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties for targeted activation with multiple triggers.

Novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks (CDA) derived from naturally occuring camphor are introduced as new design tools to construct diverse secondary structures. Specifically, the conformational switching to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix, by simply inserting flexible achiral &#946;&#8208;hGly spacers in a 6&#8208;strand stabilizing CDA&#8208;homooligomers, exemplifies the potential of the CDAs in backbone regulation and in developing functional foldamers.







Abstract
Rational design of unnatural amino acid building blocks capable of stabilizing predictable secondary structures similar to protein fragments is pivotal for foldamer chemistry/catalysis. Here, we introduce novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks: [1S,2R,4R]exoCDA and [1S,2S,4R]endoCDA, derived from the abundantly available R(+)&#8208;camphor, which is traditionally known for its medicinal value. Further, we demonstrate that the homooligomers of exoCDA adopt 6&#8208;strand conformation, which switches to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix simply by inserting flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly spacer at alternate positions (1&#8201;:&#8201;1 &#946;&#8208;hGly/exoCDA heterooligomers), as evident by DFT&#8208;calculations, solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of crystalline&#8208;state structure of left&#8208;handed 10/12&#8208;mixed helix, that is free from the conventional approach of employing &#946;&#8208;amino acids of either alternate chirality or alternate &#946;2/&#946;3 substitutions, to access the 10/12&#8208;helix. The results also show that the homooligomers of heterochiral exoCDA don&#8242;t adopt helical fold, instead exhibit banana&#8208;shaped strands, whereas the homodimers of the other diastereomer endoCDA, nucleate 8&#8208;membered turns. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;exoCDA and hetero&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;hGly&#8208;exoCDA] oligomers are found to exhibit self&#8208;association properties with distinct morphological features. Overall, the results offer new possibilties of constructing discrete stable secondary and tertiary structures based on CDAs, which can accommodate flexible residues with desired side&#8208;chain substitutions.

         <title>How to Deal with Charge in the Ranking of Lewis Acidity: Critical Evaluation of an Extensive Set of Cationic Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge of a compound strongly influences the affinity towards anionic donors. Accordingly, comparing vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) for Lewis acids of varying charge states is of limited use. Here, the systematic evaluation of the FIA of &gt;700 literature&#8208;known cationic Lewis acids suggests how to tackle this charge problem and explores the influence of counteranions.







Abstract
The quantification of Lewis acidity is of fundamental and applied importance in chemistry. However, if neutral and charged Lewis acids are compared, a coherent ranking has been elusive, and severe uncertainties were accepted. With this study, we present a systematic computational analysis of Lewis base affinities of 784 mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tricationic Lewis acids and their comparison with 149 representative neutral Lewis acids. Evaluating vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) reveals a charge&#8208;caused clustering that prohibits any meaningful ranking. Instead, solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv is identified as a metric that overcomes charge sensitivity in a balanced manner, allowing for a coherent evaluation of Lewis acidity across varying charge states. Analyzing the impact of molecular volume on solvation&#8208;induced FIA damping provides rationales for fundamental trends and guidelines for the choice or design of neutral and cationic Lewis acids in the condensed phase. Exploring alternative scales, explicit counteranion effects, and selected experimental case studies reaffirms the advantages of solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv as the most versatile and practical approach for the quantitative ranking of general (thermodynamic) Lewis acidity.

         <title>An Enzymatic Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage and Aldol Reaction Cascade Converts an Angular Scaffold into the Linear Tetracyclic Core of Ochraceopones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones originates from a common angular tetracycle through a cascade of enzymatic C&#8722;C bond cleavage and construction. The multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH facilitates the cleavage of a C&#8722;C bond in the angular tetracycle by an unprecedented free&#8208;radical&#8208;initiated process. The subsequent new aldolase OchL constructs a C&#8722;C bond through an aldol reaction to generate the linear tetracycle.







Abstract
Meroterpenoids of the ochraceopones family featuring a linear tetracyclic scaffold exhibit exceptional antiviral and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. The biosynthetic pathway and chemical logic to generate this linear tetracycle, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized all biosynthetic enzymes to afford ochraceopones and elucidated the complete biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrated that the linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones was derived from an angular tetracyclic precursor. A multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH was validated to catalyze the free&#8208;radical&#8208;initiated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage of the angular tetracycle. Then, a new carbon&#8208;carbon bond was verified to be constructed using a new aldolase OchL, which catalyzes an intramolecular aldol reaction to form the linear tetracycle. This carbon&#8208;carbon bond fragmentation and aldol reaction cascade features an unprecedented strategy for converting a common angular tetracycle to a distinctive linear tetracyclic scaffold in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.

         <title>Bending, Twisting, and Propulsion of Photoreactive Crystals by Controlled Gas Release</title>

Hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in liquid media and excited by light.







Abstract
The rapid release of gas by a chemical reaction to generate momentum is one of the most fundamental ways to elicit motion that could be used to sustain and control the motility of objects. We report that hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in mother solution. In needle&#8208;like regular crystals, the reaction occurs mainly on the surface and results in the formation of cracks that evolve due to internal pressure; the expansion on the cracked surface of the crystal results in bending, twisting, or coiling of the crystal. In hollow crystals, gas accumulates inside their cavities and emanates preferentially from the recess at the crystal terminus, propelling the crystals to undergo directional photomechanical motion through the mother solution. The motility of the object which can be controlled externally to perform work delineates the concept of &#8220;crystal microbots&#8221;, realized by photoreactive organic crystals capable of prolonged directional motion for actuation or delivery. Within the prospects, we envisage the development of a plethora of light&#8208;weight, efficient, autonomously operating robots based on organic crystals with high work capacity where motion over large distances can be attained due to the large volume of latent gas generated from a small volume of the crystalline solid.

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Gradient&#8208;Distributed Dielectric Properties toward Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gradient&#8208;distributed&#8208;dielectric carbon host (GDD&#8208;CH) is synthesized by introducing a grading content of polyantimonic acid (PAA) under the facile method of electrospinning technology and followed by carbonization progress. The gradient dielectric properties trigger a polarized electric field; the dipole moment is formed and arranged at the interface due to the directional migration of electrons and ions. This effectively regulates the Li&#8208;ion flux diffusion pathway, thus equalizing the ion concentration gradient within the host. As a result, the GDD&#8208;CH host enables dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for more than 2000&#8197;h at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The conventional conductive three&#8208;dimensional (3D) host fails to effectively stabilize lithium metal anodes (LMAs) due to the internal incongruity arising from nonuniform lithium&#8208;ion gradient and uniform electric fields. This results in undesirable Li &#8220;top&#8208;growth&#8221; behavior and dendritic Li growth, significantly impeding the practical application of LMAs. Herein, we construct a 3D hierarchical host with gradient&#8208;distributed dielectric properties (GDD&#8208;CH) that effectively regulate Li&#8208;ion diffusion and deposition behavior. It comprises a 3D carbon fiber host modified by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Sb particles, which could promote Li&#8208;ion homogeneously distribution and reduce ion concentration gradient via unique gradient dielectric polarization. Sb transforms into superionic conductive Li3Sb alloy during cycling, facilitating Li&#8208;ion dredging and pumps towards the bottom, dominating a bottom&#8208;up deposition regime confirmed by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and physicochemical characterizations. Consequently, a stable cycling performance of symmetrical cells over 2000&#8197;h under a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. The GDD&#8208;CH&#8208;based lithium metal battery shows remarkable cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 378&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low N/P ratio (1.51). This strategy of dielectric gradient design broadens the perspective for regulating the Li deposition mechanism and paves the way for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal anodes with long durability.

The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2 has been realized via dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive carboxylation of racemic aza&#8208;biaryl triflates. Compared with previous routes to atropisomeric carboxylic acids, this work features good functional group tolerance, easy to scale&#8208;up, facile transformation and avoids cumbersome steps, handling organometallic reagents and using stoichiometric chiral materials, which expands the synthetic utility of CO2 chemistry.







Abstract
Upgrading CO2 to value&#8208;added chiral molecules via catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation is a highly important yet challenging task. Although great progress on the formation of centrally chiral carboxylic acids has been achieved, catalytic construction of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2 has never been reported to date. Herein, we report the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2, which is enabled by nickel&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive carboxylation of racemic aza&#8208;biaryl triflates. A variety of important axially chiral carboxylic acids, which are valuable but difficult to obtain via catalysis, are generated in an enantioconvergent version. This new methodology features good functional group tolerance, easy to scale&#8208;up, facile transformation and avoids cumbersome steps, handling organometallic reagents and using stoichiometric chiral materials. Mechanistic investigations indicate a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process induced by chiral nickel catalysis.

         <title>Immobilization of Amino&#8208;site into a Pore&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Separation of Propyne/Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2 with densely decorated amino sites and partitioned nanospaces is capable of efficiently producing polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from C3H4&#8208;containing mixtures.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) is a crucial yet complex process, however, it remains a great difficulty in developing porous materials that can meet the requirements for practical applications, particularly with an exceptional ability to bind and store trace amounts of C3H4. Functionalization of pore&#8208;partitioned metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis&#8208;basic (&#8722;NH2) and Lewis&#8208;acidic (&#8722;NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1&#8197;kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4&#8722;C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2&#8208;decorated ppMOF (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2) can efficiently produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 (99.95&#8201;%, 8.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2&#8208;decorated crystal (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NO2). The in situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.

         <title>Regulating Lateral Adsorbate Interaction for Efficient Electroreforming of Bio&#8208;polyols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation was proposed. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which effectively tuned the adsorption energies and tailored the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products.







Abstract
Tailoring the selectivity at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is one of the greatest challenges for heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and complementary strategies to catalyst structural designs need to be developed. Herein, we proposed a new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways by lateral adsorbate interaction for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion possesses the alcoholic property that facilely adsorbs on the nickel oxyhydroxide catalyst, but is resistant to oxidation due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups. The alien HFIP adsorbents can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which achieved a &gt;2&#8208;fold enhancement of the oxalate selectivity to 55&#8201;% for the representative glycerol oxidation and can be extended to various bio&#8208;polyol substrates. Through in situ spectroscopic analysis and DFT calculation on the glycerol oxidation, we reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded adsorbate interaction can effectively tune the adsorption energies and tailor the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products. This work offers an additional perspective of tuning electrocatalytic reactions via introducing redox&#8208;innocent adsorbates to create lateral adsorbate interactions.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Linkage Chemistry and Its Critical Role in The Evolution of &#960; Electronic Structures and Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of non&#8208;conjugated, partially &#960;&#8208;conjugated, and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkages was explored to integrate typical &#960; units into 2D polymeric lattices, which led to the creation of 2D layer frameworks. The linkage plays a pivotal role in growing 2D electronic structures and determines electronic functions, unveiling a full picture of linkage chemistry and offering a general yet transformative guidance for designing electronic framework materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a molecular platform for designing a novel class of functional materials with well&#8208;defined structures. A crucial structural parameter is the linkage, which dictates how knot and linker units are connected to form two&#8208;dimensional polymers and layer frameworks, shaping ordered &#960;&#8208;array and porous architectures. However, the roles of linkage in the development of ordered &#960; electronic structures and functions remain fundamental yet unresolved issues. Here we report the designed synthesis of COFs featuring four representative linkages: hydrazone, imine, azine, and C=C bonds, to elucidate their impacts on the evolution of &#960; electronic structures and functions. Our observations revealed that the hydrazone linkage provides a non&#8208;conjugated connection, while imine and azine allow partial &#960; conjugation, and the C=C bond permits full &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Importantly, the linkage profoundly influences the control of &#960; electronic structures and functions, unraveling its pivotal role in determining key electronic properties such as band gap, frontier energy levels, light absorption, luminescence, carrier density and mobility, and magnetic permeability. These findings highlight the significance of linkage chemistry in COFs and offer a general and transformative guidance for designing framework materials to achieve electronic functions.

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>

An economical and efficient electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrogenation is described. The reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. Notably, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides can be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation of alkene and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection.







Abstract
Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;An economical and efficient electrochemical Ni-catalyzed alkene hydrogenation is described. The reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. Notably, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides can be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation of alkene and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal-hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well-established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench-stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large-scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a Ni&lt;sup&gt;II/0&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle and the pre-coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming of Supercrystals Using Replicable DNA&#8208;Functionalized Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner by integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem for producing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies.







Abstract
The development of self&#8208;replicating systems is of great importance in research on the origin of life. As the most iconic molecules, nucleic acids have provided prominent examples of the fabrication of self&#8208;replicating artificial nanostructures. However, it is still challenging to construct sophisticated synthetic systems that can create large&#8208;scale or three&#8208;dimensionally ordered nanomaterials using self&#8208;replicating nanostructures. By integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem to produce DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies, we developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner. The replication efficiency and crystal quality of the resulting superlattice structures can be effectively increased by regulating the molar ratio of the template to the copy colloids. By constructing binary systems from two types of gold nanoparticles (or proteins), superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained through the replication and catalytic assembly processes. This programmable enthalpy&#8208;mediated approach was easily leveraged to achieve the phase transformation and catalytic amplification of colloidal crystals starting from different initial template crystals. This work offers a potential way to construct self&#8208;replicating artificial systems that exhibit complicated phase behaviors and can produce large&#8208;scale superlattice nanomaterials.

         <title>Trifluoromethylation of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Mild Functionalization and Tunable p&#8208;Type Doping Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and versatile method is reported for the functionalization of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 with surface&#8208;bound trifluoromethyl groups using an easily&#8208;prepared electrophilic trifluoromethylation reagent. The nature of the adlayer is extensively characterized to reveal covalent bonding of trifluoromethyl groups at surface chalcogens and defect sites. Trifluoromethylation induces tunable p&#8208;type doping as demonstrated through photoluminescence and charge transport measurements.







Abstract
Chemical modification is a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. Here we report the electrophilic trifluoromethylation of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 under mild conditions using the reagent trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TTT). Chemical characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the trifluoromethyl groups bind covalently to surface chalcogen atoms as well as oxygen substitution sites. Trifluoromethylation induces p&#8208;type doping in the underlying 2D material, enabling the modulation of charge transport and optical emission properties in WSe2. This work introduces a versatile and efficient method for tailoring the optical and electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Distinguish MnO2/Mn2+ Conversion/ Zn2+ Intercalation/ H+ Conversion Chemistries at Different Potentials in Aqueous Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>

This study introduces a novel amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte with an extended electrochemical stability window of approximately 3.0&#8197;V in a water&#8208;rich environment (76&#8197;wt&#8201;%). This widened window enables high&#8208;voltage scanning to initiate the MnO2/Mn2+ redox conversion at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. By employing specific surfactant (e.g., hexadecyl pyridinium chloride monohydrate), the electrolyte potentially segregates Zn2+ and H+ intercalation processes. The tailored amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte facilitates the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V, exclusive Zn2+ intercalation at an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau of approximately 1.33&#8197;V, and H+ intercalation/conversion at plateaus near 1.12&#8197;V.







Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 chemistry has been extensively explored, but its electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in the context of MnO2/Mn2+ conversion and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, remain not fully understood. Here, we designed an amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte, which distinguished the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion, Zn2+ intercalation, and H+ intercalation and conversion processes at three distinct discharge plateaus of an aqueous Zn||MnO2 battery. The amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte is featured with an extended electrochemical stability window up to 3.0&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity, Zn2+&#8208;selective ion tunnels, and hydrophobic associations with cathode materials. This specifically designed electrolyte allows the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. More interesting, the discharge plateaus of ~1.33&#8197;V, previously assigned as the co&#8208;intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ ions in the MnO2 cathode, are specified as the exclusive intercalation of Zn2+ ions, leading to an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau. Furthermore, with a distinct three&#8208;step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high specific energy of 0.858&#8197;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even at a low MnO2 loading mass of 0.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Tailoring Second Coordination Sphere for Tunable Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Charge Transfer toward Enhanced Photoelectrochemical H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8211;liquid interfacial charge transfer dynamics of p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated by designing the metal centers and first/second coordination spheres of molecular catalysts in the electrolyte. The p&#8208;Si/Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 photocathode system exhibits efficient and durable photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.







Abstract
The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8211;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H2 production performance. Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H2 production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2, which contains an electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8722;SO3H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat&#8208;band potential of the polished p&#8208;Si photocathode and nanoporous p&#8208;Si photocathode by 81&#8197;mV and 124&#8197;mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95&#8201;% for H2 production, which is well maintained during 18&#8197;h and 21&#8197;h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band&#8208;edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8211;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H2 production.

&lt;p&gt;The solid&#8211;liquid interfacial charge transfer dynamics of p-Si photocathode is modulated by designing the metal centers and first/second coordination spheres of molecular catalysts in the electrolyte. The p-Si/Co(pda-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocathode system exhibits efficient and durable photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8211;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p-Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production performance. Co(pda-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which contains an electron-withdrawing &#8722;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat-band potential of the polished p-Si photocathode and nanoporous p-Si photocathode by 81&#8197;mV and 124&#8197;mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95&#8201;% for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, which is well maintained during 18&#8197;h and 21&#8197;h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band-edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8211;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precision Engineering of the Co&#8208;immobilization of Enzymes for Cascade Biocatalysis</title>

A double&#8208;layered coating approach was developed for the precise and sequential immobilization of dual&#8208;enzyme systems on resin particles using two biorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition. The method enables the combined purification and the ordered immobilization of enzymes and significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency and recyclability of multienzyme systems.







Abstract
The design and orderly layered co&#8208;immobilization of multiple enzymes on resin particles remain challenging. In this study, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher binding pair was fused to the N&#8208;terminus of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldo&#8208;keto reductase (AKR), respectively. A non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA), p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (p&#8208;AzF), as the anchor for covalent bonding enzymes, was genetically inserted into preselected sites in the AKR and ADH. Employing the two bioorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition for the immobilization of AKR and ADH enabled sequential dual&#8208;enzyme coating on porous microspheres. The ordered dual&#8208;enzyme reactor was subsequently used to synthesize (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanol asymmetrically from the corresponding prochiral ketone, enabling the in situ regeneration of NADPH. The reactor exhibited a high catalytic conversion of 74&#8201;% and good reproducibility, retaining 80&#8201;% of its initial activity after six cycles. The product had 99.9&#8201;% ee, which that was maintained in each cycle. Additionally, the double&#8208;layer immobilization method significantly increased the enzyme loading capacity, which was approximately 1.7&#8197;times greater than that of traditional single&#8208;layer immobilization. More importantly, it simultaneously enabled both the purification and immobilization of multiple enzymes on carriers, thus providing a convenient approach to facilitate cascade biocatalysis.

         <title>Selective Stereoretention of Carbohydrates upon C&#8722;C Cleavage Enabling D&#8208;Glyceric Acid Production with High Optical Purity over a Ag/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative stereostructure&#8208;retention strategy enabled the preservation of a stereogenic center and precise C2&#8722;C3 cleavage in sugars. D&#8208;Glyceric acid production with the highest yield reported to date (86.8&#8201;%) and &gt;99&#8201;% ee was achieved without the use of an asymmetric catalyst. This approach overcomes the current limitation of poor enantioselectivity and suggests new possibilities for chiral chemical production from renewable biomass.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acid production from renewable biomass by chemocatalysis is vitally important for reducing our carbon footprint, but remains underdeveloped. We herein establish a strategy that make use of a stereogenic center of biomass to achieve a rare example of D&#8208;glyceric acid production with the highest yield (86.8&#8201;%) reported to date as well as an excellent ee value (&gt;99&#8201;%). Unlike traditional asymmetric catalysis, chiral catalysts/additives are not required. Ample experiments combined with quantum chemical calculations established the origins of the stereogenic center and catalyst performance. The chirality at C4 in D&#8208;xylose was proved to be retained and successfully delivered to C2 in D&#8208;glyceric acid during C&#8722;C cleavage. The remarkable cooperative&#8208;roles of Ag+ and Ag0 in the constructed Ag/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst are disclosed as the crucial contributors. Ag+ was responsible for low&#8208;temperature activation of D&#8208;xylose, while Ag0 facilitated the generation of active O* from O2. Ag+ and active O* cooperatively promoted the precise cleavage of the C2&#8722;C3 bond, and more importantly O* allowed the immediate fast oxidization of the D&#8208;glyceraldehyde intermediate to stabilize D&#8208;glyceric acid, thereby inhibiting the side reaction that induced racemization. This strategy makes a significant breakthrough in overcoming the limitation of poor enantioselectivity in current chemocatalytic conversion of biomass.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Switchable Peroxidase/Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of Carbon Quantum Dots</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) are synthesized using polyaniline as a precursor. O/N&#8208;CQDs possess photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity that can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity dynamically. Using such an artificial &#8220;light switch&#8221;, it is feasible to autonomously manipulate the ROS level that is adaptive to the development of diseases, providing an intelligent therapeutic strategy for precise medicine.







Abstract
Nanozymes possess multi&#8208;enzyme activities over the natural enzymes, which produce multi&#8208;pathway synergistic effects for varies of biomedical applications. Unfortunately, their multi&#8208;enzyme activities are in fighting, significantly reducing the synergistic effects. Dynamic regulation of their multi&#8208;enzyme activities is the bottleneck for intelligent therapies. Herein, we construct a novel oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer) activity. Interestingly, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity can be reversibly converted to catalase&#8208;like (ROS scavenger) activity under visible light irradiation. It is found that both the peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity. The mechanism of switchable enzyme activities is attributed to the polarization of quinoid nitrogen in polyaniline (PANI) precursor retained on O/N&#8208;CQDs under visible light, which consumes the ROS to produce O2 and H2O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we are able to non&#8208;intrusively up and down regulate the ROS level in cells successfully by simply switching off and on the light respectively, potentially facilitating the precise medicine based on the development of the disease. Indeed, the photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs opens a non&#8208;invasive strategy for better manipulations of the multi&#8208;activity of nanozymes, promising their wider and more intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate in a NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O Ternary Electrolyte</title>

The glut in NH3 production has resulted in a heavily imbalanced N&#8208;cycle causing massive accumulation of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in our ecosystems, destroying the environment. Upcycling these Nr via electrochemical conversion into NH3 can partially close the N&#8208;cycle and reduce reliance on the carbon&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosh process. Here we report the remarkable performance of a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni catalyst at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
A glut of dinitrogen&#8208;derived ammonia (NH3) over the past century has resulted in a heavily imbalanced nitrogen cycle and consequently, the large&#8208;scale accumulation of reactive nitrogen such as nitrates in our ecosystems has led to detrimental environmental issues. Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste nitrogen back into NH3 holds promise in mitigating these environmental impacts and reducing reliance on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance electrolyzer using an ultrahigh alkalinity electrolyte, NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O, for low&#8208;cost NH3 electrosynthesis. At 3,000&#8197;mA/cm2, the device with a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst achieves an unprecedented faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5&#177;1.5&#8201;% under a low cell voltage of 3.83&#8197;V; whereas at 1,000&#8197;mA/cm2, an FE of 96.5&#177;4.8&#8201;% under a cell voltage of only 2.40&#8197;V was achieved. Techno&#8208;economic analysis revealed that our device cuts the levelized cost of ammonia electrosynthesis by ~40&#8201;% ($30.68 for Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni vs. $48.53 for Ni foam per kmol&#8208;NH3). The NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O electrolyte together with the Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst can enable the high&#8208;throughput nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia applications for affordable and scalable real&#8208;world wastewater treatments.

&lt;p&gt;The glut in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production has resulted in a heavily imbalanced N-cycle causing massive accumulation of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in our ecosystems, destroying the environment. Upcycling these Nr via electrochemical conversion into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can partially close the N-cycle and reduce reliance on the carbon-intensive Haber-Bosh process. Here we report the remarkable performance of a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni catalyst at industrially relevant current densities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glut of dinitrogen-derived ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) over the past century has resulted in a heavily imbalanced nitrogen cycle and consequently, the large-scale accumulation of reactive nitrogen such as nitrates in our ecosystems has led to detrimental environmental issues. Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste nitrogen back into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; holds promise in mitigating these environmental impacts and reducing reliance on the energy-intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Herein, we report a high-performance electrolyzer using an ultrahigh alkalinity electrolyte, NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for low-cost NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis. At 3,000&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the device with a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst achieves an unprecedented faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5&#177;1.5&#8201;% under a low cell voltage of 3.83&#8197;V; whereas at 1,000&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an FE of 96.5&#177;4.8&#8201;% under a cell voltage of only 2.40&#8197;V was achieved.

         <title>How to Decarbonize N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs): The simple Alane Adducts (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlR3 (R=H, Me, Et)</title>

A case study on different decomposition channels of a backbone saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene in the coordination sphere of alanes is reported. This study provides evidence that NHCs, nowadays ubiquitous ligands in transition metal and main group chemistry, are not always inert bystanders and &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands, as often considered.







Abstract
The reaction of the amine&#8208;stabilized alane (NMe3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 1 with the backbone&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) SIDipp (SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) at 0&#8201;&#176;C yielded the NHC alane adduct (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2. Reaction at elevated temperatures or prolonged reaction at room temperature gave the product of a ring expansion reaction (RER) of the NHC, (NMe3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH(RER&#8208;SIDippH2) 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NMe3). Subsequent reaction of the latter with sterically less hindered NHCs (IMeMe {=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, IiPrMe {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, and IiPr {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}) afforded the NHC&#8208;stabilized RER&#8208;products (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH(RER&#8208;SIDippH2) 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NHC) (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe, IiPr), while no reaction was observed with the sterically more demanding NHCs IDipp (=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), SIDipp and ItBu (=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The compounds 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NHC) were also obtained starting from (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2 and NHC at room temperature. Heating solutions of (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2 without additional base to 95&#8201;&#176;C resulted in decarbonization of the NHC and substitution of the carbene carbon atom with aluminum hydride under loss of ethene. Subsequent dimerization afforded cis&#8208;[AlH{&#956;&#8208;N(Dipp)CH2CH2N(Dipp)}]2 4_dimer. Heating solutions of the NHC&#8208;ligated aluminum alkyls (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlR3 2R (R=Me, Et) to 145&#8201;&#176;C instead led to complete scission of the NHC backbone with evolution of ethene and isolation of the dialkylaluminium(III) amidinates {DippNC(R)NDipp}AlR2 5R (R=Me, Et).

         <title>Reticular Modulation of Piezofluorochromic Behaviors in Organic Molecular Cages by Replacing Non&#8208;Luminous Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A luminescent organic molecular cage (OMC) that displays piezochromic behavior has been synthesized by incorporating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores into its structure. Changing the rigidity of the cage by replacing the non&#8208;luminous components enabled further modulation of the flexibility and versatility of the OMCs, with a remarkable luminescence peak shift observed upon hydrostatic compression.







Abstract
Organic piezochromic materials that manifest pressure&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responses are important in various fields such as data storage and anticounterfeiting. The manipulation of piezofluorochromic behaviors for these materials is promising but remains a great challenge. Herein, a non&#8208;luminous components regulated strategy is developed and organic molecular cages (OMCs), a burgeoning class of crystalline organic materials with structural dynamics, are first explored for the design of piezofluorochromic materials with tunable luminescence. A series of OMCs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores, termed Cage&#8197;1&#8211;3, are synthesized and their piezofluorochromic behaviors are investigated by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the sufficient voids between its flexible chromophores offered by the OMC structure, Cage&#8197;1 exhibits thermofluorochromic and piezofluorochromic properties. Moreover, the piezofluorochromic performance of this OMC could be further promoted by replacing its non&#8208;luminous components with improved flexibilities, and a remarkable luminescence peak shift by 150&#8197;nm together with a response sensitivity of 13.8&#8197;nm&#8201;GPa&#8722;1 was achieved upon hydrostatic compression. The cage structure plays a vital role in facilitating efficient and reversible piezofluorochromic behaviors. This study has shed light on the rational design and exploitation of OMCs as an exceptional platform to accomplish customizable piezofluorochromic behaviors and enlarge their potential applications in pressure&#8208;based luminescence.

         <title>Transesterification Induced Multifunctional Additives Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole dimethylphosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyltrimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. Among them, DTMSP removes H2O and HF, and DITFA promotes the dissolution of LiNO3 in carbonate electrolyte. Both DTMSP and DITFA have low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), tending to preferentially redox decompose to produce a high&#8208;quality electrode electrolyte interphase layer.







Abstract
The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H2O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li+. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic&#8208;rich layer (e.g. Li3N/Li3P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high&#8208;performance electrolyte for LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;1,3-dimethylimidazole dimethylphosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyltrimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3-dimethylimidazole trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. Among them, DTMSP removes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF, and DITFA promotes the dissolution of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in carbonate electrolyte. Both DTMSP and DITFA have low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), tending to preferentially redox decompose to produce a high-quality electrode electrolyte interphase layer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3-dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic-rich layer (e.g. Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high-performance electrolyte for LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Anode/Electrolyte Interfaces Coupled with Regulated Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Term and Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic anode/electrolyte interface coupled with regulated solvation structures strategy is firstly realized with Tris additive for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract solvated&#8208;Zn2+, then promote the de&#8208;solvation by the orientation polarization, the volume rejection effect and strong intermolecular force of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris, leading to an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport kinetics and the inhibition of side reactions.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) show a great potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their high safety and high energy density. However, the severe side reactions of zinc negative electrode largely hinder the further application of AZIBs. Herein, trace tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) additive with rich lone&#8208;pair&#8208;electrons and zincophilic sites is firstly introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, Tris not only regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, but is also adsorbed vertically on the Zn anode surface with a changed coordination intensity during the plating/stripping process of Zn to generate an in situ dynamic adsorption layer for the first time. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract the solvated Zn2+ and then promote the de&#8208;solvation of the solvated Zn2+ owing to the orientation polarization with regularly&#8208;changed applied electric field, the volume rejection effect, and strong intermolecular force towards H2O of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris. Therefore, an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport kinetics as well as the inhibition of side reactions of Zn anode are successfully realized. Accordingly, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell provides an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 2600&#8197;h. Furthermore, the Zn||MnO2 full cell with Tris could demonstrate a high capacity and structural stability for practical applications.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution in Neutral Media by Differential Intermediate Binding at Charge&#8208;Modulated Sites of a Bimetallic Alloy Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential binding of H* and OH* on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of amorphous Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 50&#177;9&#8197;mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential intermediate binding on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam (NF), where the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1&#8197;M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is only 50&#177;9&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It has a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1, mass activity of 13.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;200&#8197;mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and produces 16&#8197;ml H2 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;300&#8197;mV vs. RHE, more than double that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C. The Mo&#948;+ and Co&#948;&#8722; sites adsorb OH*, and H*, respectively, and the electron injection from Co to H&#8722;O&#8722;H cleaves the O&#8722;H bond to form the Mo&#8722;OH* intermediate. Operando spectral analyses indicate a weak H&#8208;bonded network for facilitating the H2O*/OH* transport, and a potential&#8208;induced reversal of the charge density from Co to the more electronegative Mo, because of the electron withdrawing Co&#8722;H* and Mo&#8722;OH* species. Co85Mo15/NF can also drive the complete electrolysis of neutral water at only 1.73&#8197;V (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In alkaline, and acidic media, it demonstrates a Pt&#8208;like HER activity, accomplishing &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 161&#177;7, and 175&#177;22&#8197;mV, respectively.

         <title>Novel Stereo&#8208;Induction Pattern in Pudovik Addition/Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement Towards Chiral Trisubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed to synthesize axially chiral phosphorus allenes through a PPS&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Pudovik addition followed by phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. Mechanistic experiments have demonstrated that the enantio&#8208;determining step is the 1,2&#8208;addition, with the subsequent rearrangement undergoing a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Despite the significance of chiral allene skeletons in catalysis, organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry et&#8197;al., there is a scarcity of reports on axially chiral allenyl phosphorus compounds. Here, we disclosed an efficient and straightforward cascade reaction between ethynyl ketones and phosphine oxides, resulting in a broad array of trisubstituted allenes incorporating a phosphorus moiety in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities facilitated by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis, Additionally, comprehensive series of mechanistic experiments have been conducted to elucidate that this cascade reaction proceeds via an asymmetric Pudovik addition reaction followed by a subsequent phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement that occurs concomitantly with kinetic resolution, representing a stereospecific rearrangement and protonation process facilitating central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer in a cascade manner. We anticipate that our research will pave the way for a promising exploration of novel stereo&#8208;induction pattern in the Pudovik addition/phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement cascade reaction.

         <title>Vertically Concentrated Quantum Wells Enabling Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a thermal&#8208;gradient annealing treatment to address the issue of vertical quantum well (QW) polydispersity in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained, which enables a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) systems exist heightened sensitivity to the domain distribution. The top&#8208;down crystallization mode will lead to a vertical gradient distribution of quantum well (QW) structure, which is unfavorable for deep&#8208;blue emission. Herein, a thermal gradient annealing treatment is proposed to address the polydispersity issue of vertical QWs in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The formation of large&#8208;n domains at the upper interface of the perovskite film can be effectively inhibited by introducing a low&#8208;temperature source in the annealing process. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained. As a result, the fabricated device delivers a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%. Green and sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with remarkable EQE of 21.83&#8201;% and 17.51&#8201;% are also successfully achieved, respectively, by using the same strategy. The findings provide a universal strategy across the entire quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, paving the way for future practical application of PeLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a thermal-gradient annealing treatment to address the issue of vertical quantum well (QW) polydispersity in quasi-2D perovskites.

         <title>Completely Non&#8208;Fused Low&#8208;Cost Acceptor Enables Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 17&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By successive changes in molecular configuration and branching position of alkoxy side chains, we designed and synthesized a completely non&#8208;fused acceptor, TBT&#8208;26, with a narrow band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV and excellent stability. TBT&#8208;26 has a significantly low raw material cost of about 12&#8197;$/g. The TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based device gives outstanding power conversion efficiency of 17.0&#8201;% for small area device and 14.3&#8201;% for large area module with an area of 28.8&#8197;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
To meet the industrial requirements of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, it is imperative to accelerate the development of cost&#8208;effective materials. Thiophene&#8208;benzene&#8208;thiophene central unit&#8208;based acceptors possess the advantage of low synthetic cost, while their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is relatively low. Here, by incorporating a para&#8208;substituted benzene unit and 1st&#8208;position branched alkoxy chains with large steric hindrance, a completely non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, TBT&#8208;26, was designed and synthesized. The narrow band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV ensures the effective utilization of sunlight. The favorable phase separation morphology of TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based blend film facilitates the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in corresponding OPV cell. Therefore, the TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based small&#8208;area cell achieves an impressive PCE of 17.0&#8201;%, which is the highest value of completely non&#8208;fused OPV cells. Additionally, we successfully demonstrated the scalability of this design by fabricating a 28.8&#8197;cm2 module with a high PCE of 14.3&#8201;%. Overall, our work provides a practical molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost acceptors, paving the way for industrial applications of OPV technology.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Delivery of Charged Species using Ion&#8208;selective Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell POT&#8208;membrane nanoparticles are synthesized and characterized. By tailoring the composition of the membrane in the shell, the selective encapsulation and light&#8208;driven release of cations is demonstrated through optical and electrochemical experiments. On&#8208;off cycles of irradiation allowed for subsequent delivery/encapsulation of cations from/to the NPs, which is useful for future on&#8208;demand drug delivery nanoplatforms.







Abstract
Controlled release systems have gained considerable attention owing to their potential to deliver molecules, including ions and drugs, in a customized manner. We present a light&#8208;induced ion&#8208;transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300&#8197;nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)&#8208;selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, POT NPs can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0 and doped POT+ coexist in the core, allowing K+ encapsulation in the shell. As POT0 is photo&#8208;oxidized to POT+, K+ is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality of the NPs. This process is reversible and can be simultaneously assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0 and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.

         <title>Stiffness Modulation and Pulsatile Release in Dual Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hydrogels that similar to living organisms can maintain or adapt their properties and internal structure upon exposure to a combination of external stimuli. These hydrogels contain both redox and light responsive units, which can operate independently if addressed separately, but show adaptivity and self&#8208;regulation of stiffness when addressed simultaneously.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, self&#8208;regulation can be introduced in synthetic hydrogels by incorporating chemo&#8208;mechanical signals or coupled chemical reactions to maintain or adapt the material's physico&#8208;chemical properties when exposed to external triggers. In this work, we present redox and light dual stimuli responsive hydrogels capable of rapidly adapting the polymer crosslinking network while maintaining hydrogel stability. Upon irradiation with UV light, polymer hydrogels containing redox responsive disulfide crosslinks and light responsive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties show a release of payload accompanied by adaptation of the hydrogel network towards higher stiffness due to in situ crosslinking by S&#8208;nitrosylation. Whereas the hydrogel design allows the network to either become softer in presence of reducing agent glutathione or stiffer upon UV irradiation, simultaneous application of both stimuli induces network self&#8208;regulation resulting in a pulsatile form of payload release from the hydrogel. Finally, adaptive stiffness was used to make tunable hydrogels as substrates for different cell lines.

         <title>Monitoring ROS Responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based Nanoparticle Mediated Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy via 129Xe MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supplying ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4 nanoparticle was designed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy by ROS&#8208;mediated size reduction and charge reversion. Moreover, the 129Xe MRI of lung metastases showed significant differences in lung ventilation defects in the treatment and control groups, indicating the great potential of 129Xe MRI for monitoring the immunotherapeutic efficacy of lung metastatic cancer.







Abstract
The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late&#8208;stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe3O4 by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune&#8208;activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H2O2. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H2O2, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized 129Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered. The ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced immunotherapy combined with non&#8208;radiation evaluation methodology paves a new way for designing novel theranostic agents for cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late-stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS-responsive Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune-activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune-suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with &#945;-PD-L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticle-mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered. The ferroptosis-enhanced immunotherapy combined with non-radiation evaluation methodology paves a new way for designing novel theranostic agents for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Efficient Dark Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with Ultra&#8208;Wide Range Tunable&#8208;Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of efficient dark blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials with tunable&#8208;lifetime have been prepared. The phosphorescence lifetime of the doped films can be continuously increased from 32.8&#8197;ms to 1925.8&#8197;ms. The reason is that the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group can modulate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO and singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, as well as the interactive force with methyl benzoate derivatives and polyvinyl alcohol.







Abstract
Tunable&#8208;lifetime room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been widely studied due to their broad applications. However, only few reports have achieved wide&#8208;range lifetime modulation. In this work, ultra&#8208;wide range tunable&#8208;lifetime efficient dark blue RTP materials were realized by doping methyl benzoate derivatives into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. The phosphorescence lifetimes of the doped films can be increased from 32.8&#8197;ms to 1925.8&#8197;ms. Such wide range of phosphorescence lifetime modulation is extremely rare in current reports. Moreover, the phosphorescence emission of the methyl 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate&#8208;doped film is located in the dark blue region and the phosphorescence quantum yield reaches as high as 15.4&#8201;%, which broadens their applications in organic optoelectronic information. Further studies demonstrated that the reason for the tunable lifetime was that the magnitude of the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group modulates the HOMO&#8211;LUMO and singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of methyl benzoate derivatives, as well as the ability to non&#8208;covalent interactions with PVA. Moreover, the potential applications of luminescent displays and optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these high&#8208;performance dark blue RTP materials have been conducted.

         <title>Understanding Defects in Amorphous Silicon with Million&#8208;Atom Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning methods and computational chemistry are combined to develop a comprehensive understanding of coordination defects in amorphous silicon. Fivefold&#8208;connected atoms fall into three categories based on their chemical structure, and are found to cluster together, which can be explained based on energetic arguments.







Abstract
The structure of amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si) is widely thought of as a fourfold&#8208;connected random network, and yet it is defective atoms, with fewer or more than four bonds, that make it particularly interesting. Despite many attempts to explain such &#8220;dangling&#8208;bond&#8221; and &#8220;floating&#8208;bond&#8221; defects, respectively, a unified understanding is still missing. Here, we use advanced computational chemistry methods to reveal the complex structural and energetic landscape of defects in a&#8208;Si. We study an ultra&#8208;large&#8208;scale, quantum&#8208;accurate structural model containing a million atoms, and thousands of individual defects, allowing reliable defect&#8208;related statistics to be obtained. We combine structural descriptors and machine&#8208;learned atomic energies to develop a classification of the different types of defects in a&#8208;Si. The results suggest a revision of the established floating&#8208;bond model by showing that fivefold&#8208;bonded atoms in a&#8208;Si exhibit a wide range of local environments&#8211;analogous to fivefold centers in coordination chemistry. Furthermore, it is shown that fivefold (but not threefold) coordination defects tend to cluster together. Our study provides new insights into one of the most widely studied amorphous solids, and has general implications for understanding defects in disordered materials beyond silicon alone.

         <title>Electro/Ni Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Carboxylates and Aryl Bromide</title>

Electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of widely available carboxylate nucleophiles with aryl bromides are developed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral cross&#8208;coupling expands the chemical space of paired electrosynthesis and represents a sustainable method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond.







Abstract
Paired redox&#8208;neutral electrolysis offers an attractive green platform for organic synthesis by avoiding sacrificial oxidants and reductants. Carboxylates are non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive, and widely available, making them ideal nucleophiles for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here, we report the electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of pristine carboxylates with aryl bromides. At a cathode, a NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate is formed through the activation of Ar&#8722;Br bond by a NiI&#8208;bipyridine catalyst and subsequent reduction. At an anode, the carboxylates, including amino acid, benzyl carboxylic acid, and 2&#8208;phenoxy propionic acid, undergo oxidative decarboxylation to form carbon&#8208;based free radicals. The combination of NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate and carbon radical results in the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling products. The adaptation of this electrosynthesis method to flow synthesis and valuable molecule synthesis was demonstrated. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied through electrochemical voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies. The relationships between the electrochemical properties of carboxylates and the reaction selectivity were revealed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions described herein expand the chemical space of paired electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling and represent a promising method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds because of the ubiquitous carboxylate nucleophiles and the innate scalability and flexibility of electrochemical flow&#8208;synthesis technology.

         <title>Homochiral &#960;&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled Chirality Imprinting in Conjugated Polymers: Confined Polymerization and Chiral Memory from Scratch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) were synthesized through confined polymerization within &#960;&#8208;rich homochiral covalent organic frameworks, utilizing a chiral imprinting process. The isolated OACPs retained chirality and displayed robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids.







Abstract
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) have garnered increasing research interest for their resemblance to biological helices and intriguing chirality&#8208;related functions. Traditional methods for synthesizing involve decorating achiral conjugated polymer architectures with enantiopure side substituents through complex organic synthesis. Here, we report a new approach: the templated synthesis of unsubstituted OACPs via supramolecularly confined polymerizations of achiral monomers within nanopores of 2D or 3D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs). We show that the chiral &#960;&#8208;rich nanospaces facilitate the in situ enantiospecific polymerization and self&#8208;propagation, akin to nonenzymatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, resulting in chiral imprinting. The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200&#8201;&#176;C. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.

The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200&#8201;&#176;C. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using an Osmium Complex as a Panchromatic Self&#8208;Photosensitized Catalyst: Utilization of Blue, Green, and Red Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Os complex that absorbs longer&#8208;wavelength light (350&#8211;700&#8197;nm) has been developed as a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955;&#8805;400&#8197;nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded with monochromatic blue (&#955;0=405&#8197;nm), green (&#955;0=525&#8197;nm), or red (&#955;0=630&#8197;nm) light with a high CO selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) represents an attractive approach for solar&#8208;energy storage and leads to the production of renewable fuels and valuable chemicals. Although some osmium (Os) photosensitizers absorb long wavelengths in the visible&#8208;light region, a self&#8208;photosensitized, mononuclear Os catalyst for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction has not yet been exploited. Here, we discovered that the introduction of an Os metal to a PNNP&#8208;type tetradentate ligand resulted in the absorption of light with longer&#8208;wavelength (350&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and that can be applied to a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955;&#8805;400&#8197;nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded under irradiation with blue (&#955;0=405&#8197;nm), green (&#955;0=525&#8197;nm), or red (&#955;0=630&#8197;nm) light to give CO with &gt;90&#8201;% selectivity. The quantum efficiency using red light was determined to be 12&#8201;% for the generation of CO. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the detection of intermediates using various spectroscopic techniques, including transient absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Dual Enhancement of Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Entropically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropically driven self&#8208;assembled system based on a platinum complex displays a dual enhancement of phosphorescence and chiroptical response, both in the ground state and excited state (glum value increases from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06), upon elevating the temperature of the supramolecular system. The strategy developed in this work overcomes the customary trade&#8208;off between QY and glum, a prevalent challenge in most CPL materials.







Abstract
Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L&#8722;Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of L&#8722;Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15&#8201;% at 25&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;% at 60&#8201;&#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10&#8197;cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L&#8722;Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L&#8722;Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69&#8201;% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self&#8208;assembled CPL systems. This study marks the pioneering demonstration of dual thermo&#8208;enhancement of phosphorescence and CPL and provides valuable insights into the thermal effects on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Curvature Induction in an Artificial Bilayer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous curvature induction in an artificial supramolecular bilayer membrane and its transformation into vesicles in pure water is demonstrated. Compositional asymmetry resulting from the autogenous protonation of amines led to the formation of an asymmetric membrane and curvature induction. The stability provided by the hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of the supramolecular structure in water appears to be critical in the dynamic morphological transformations.







Abstract
Maintaining lipid asymmetry across membrane leaflets is critical for functions like vesicular traffic and organelle homeostasis. However, a lack of molecular&#8208;level understanding of the mechanisms underlying membrane fission and fusion processes in synthetic systems precludes their development as artificial analogs. Here, we report asymmetry induction of a bilayer membrane formed by an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with oxyalkylene side chains bearing terminal tertiary amine moieties (BA1) in water. Autogenous protonation of the tertiary amines in the periphery of the bilayer by water induces anisotropic curvature, resulting in membrane fission to form vesicles and can be monitored using time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy and microscopy. Interestingly, upon loss of the induced asymmetry by extensive protonation using an organic acid restored bilayer membrane. The mechanism leading to the compositional asymmetry in the leaflet and curvature induction in the membrane is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Studies extended to control molecules having changes in hydrophilic (BA2) and hydrophobic (BA3) segments provide insight into the delicate nature of molecular scale interactions in the dynamic transformation of supramolecular structures. The synergic effect of hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of BA1 aggregates provide dynamicity and unusual stability. Our study unveils mechanistic insight into the dynamic transformation of bilayer membranes into vesicles.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Linker Strategy for the Construction of Sulfone&#8208;Containing D&#8211;A&#8211;A Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>

Sulfone&#8208;containing D&#8211;A&#8211;A covalent organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized via a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to facilitate charge transport and surface reactions with water. High photocatalytic H2O2 production activity was achieved to create solutions that can be used directly for the degradation of organic pollutants.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen using semiconductor catalysts offers a promising approach for converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production is often restricted by the low photo&#8208;generated charge separation, slow surface reactions and inadequate stability. Here, we developed a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to build a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8211;A) type covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF. The FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF structure features extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation that improves charge mobility, while the introduction of sulfone units not only as active sites facilitates surface reactions with water but also bolsters stability through increased interlayer forces. The resulting FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF has a low exciton binding energy, long excited&#8208;state lifetime and high photo&#8208;stability that leads to high performance for photocatalytic H2O2 production (up to 1.0&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) with an H2O2 output of 19&#8197;mM after 72&#8197;hours of irradiation. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates high stability, which sustained activity over 192&#8197;hours of photocatalytic experiment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar-driven photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from water and oxygen using semiconductor catalysts offers a promising approach for converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is often restricted by the low photo-generated charge separation, slow surface reactions and inadequate stability. Here, we developed a mixed-linker strategy to build a donor-acceptor-acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8211;A) type covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, FS-OHOMe-COF. The FS-OHOMe-COF structure features extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation that improves charge mobility, while the introduction of sulfone units not only as active sites facilitates surface reactions with water but also bolsters stability through increased interlayer forces. The resulting FS-OHOMe-COF has a low exciton binding energy, long excited-state lifetime and high photo-stability that leads to high performance for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (up to 1.0&#8197;mM&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output of 19&#8197;mM after 72&#8197;hours of irradiation. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates high stability, which sustained activity over 192&#8197;hours of photocatalytic experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Carbon dioxide hydrate upon low temperature compression transforms into different crystalline polymorphs of elusive carbonic acid. In view of the widespread diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in the Universe, this finding represents a valuable support for understanding and modelling the complex crustal composition of Solar and exoSolar icy bodies.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is widespread in astrochemically relevant environments, often coexisting with water (H2O) ices and thus triggering a great interest regarding the possible formation of their adducts under various thermodynamic conditions. Amongst them, solid carbonic acid (H2CO3) remains elusive, yet being widely studied. Synthetic routes followed for its production have always been characterised by drastic irradiation on solid ice mixtures or complex procedures on fluid samples (such as laser heating at moderate to high pressures). Here we report about a simpler yet effective synthetic route to obtain two diverse carbonic acid crystal structures from the fast, cold compression of pristine clathrate hydrate samples. The two distinct polymorphs we obtained, differing in the water content, have been deeply characterised via spectroscopic and structural techniques to assess their composition and their astonishing pressure stability, checked up to half a megabar, also highlighting the complex correlations between them so to compile a detailed phase diagram of this system. These results may have a profound impact on the prediction and modelisation of the complex chemistry which characterises many icy bodies of our Solar System.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expanding Difluorination: An Enantioselective Platform to Access &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Difluorinated Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(I)/I(III)&#8208;catalysed ring expanding fluorination of cyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters has been developed to generate gem&#8208;difluorinated 6&#8211;10 membered rings (up to 95&#8201;%). Validation of an enantiodivergent variant is also disclosed using a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol catalyst (up to 7&#8201;:&#8201;93&#8197;e.r.) and X&#8208;ray analyses of selected products reveals the subtle impact of difluorination on widening the internal &#8736;CCC angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C).







Abstract
Cyclic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;carbonyl compounds have a venerable history as drug discovery leads, but limitations in the synthesis arsenal continue to impede chemical space exploration. This challenge is particularly acute in the arena of fluorinated medium rings where installing the difluoromethylene unit subtly alters the ring conformation by expanding the internal angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C): this provides a handle to modulate physicochemistry (e.g. pKa). To reconcile this disparity, a highly modular ring expansion has been devised that leverages simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides, and processes them to one&#8208;carbon homologated rings with concomitant geminal difluorination (6 to 10 membered rings, up to 95&#8201;% yield). This process is a rare example of the formal difluorination of an internal alkene and is enabled by sequential I(III)&#8208;enabled O&#8208;activation. Validation of enantioselective catalysis in the generation of unprecedented medium ring scaffolds is reported (up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7&#8197;e.r.) together with X&#8208;ray structural analyses and product derivatization.

         <title>Upcycling of Carbon Fiber/Thermoset Composites into High&#8208;Performance Elastomers and Repurposed Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;crosslinked polyurethane thermosets with CF cloths. Upon heating CFRCs in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, polyurethane thermosets are cleaved into linear polymers, which generates non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and value&#8208;added healable and reprocessable elastomers with high mechanical strength and damage resistance.







Abstract
Recycling of carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) based on thermosetting plastics is difficult. In the present study, high&#8208;performance CFRCs are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polyurethane (PU&#8722;AP) thermosets with carbon fiber (CF) cloths. PU&#8722;AP thermosets exhibit a breaking strength of 95.5&#8197;MPa and toughness of 473.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 and contain abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups, which can have strong adhesion with CFs. Because of the high interfacial adhesion between CF cloths and PU&#8722;AP thermosets and high toughness of PU&#8722;AP thermosets, CF/PU&#8722;AP composites possess a high tensile strength of &gt;870&#8197;MPa. Upon heating in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at 100&#8201;&#176;C, the aromatic pinacols in the CF/PU&#8722;AP composites can be cleaved, generating non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and linear polymers that can be converted to high&#8208;performance elastomers. The elastomers are mechanically robust, healable, reprocessable, and damage&#8208;resistant with an extremely high tensile strength of 74.2&#8197;MPa and fracture energy of 149.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2. As a result, dissociation of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites enables the recovery of reusable CF cloths and high&#8208;performance elastomers, thus realizing the upcycling of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Catalyzes Oxidative Coupling Formation of Insecticidal Dimeric Indole Piperazine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fungal cytochrome P450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster were discovered from 37208 CYP450s by genome mining. CpsD catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to give a group of unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring&#8208;scaffold heterodimeric compounds through the formation of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds. Dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the pest Galleria mellonella.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling is an efficient strategy for using simple building blocks to construct complex structural scaffolds of natural products. Among them, heterodimeric coupling between two different monomers is relatively scarce, and the corresponding CYP450s are largely undiscovered. In this study, we discovered a fungal CYP450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster from 37208 CYP450s of Pfam PF00067 family member database and subsequently identified a group of new skeleton indole piperazine alkaloids (campesines A&#8722;G) by combination of genome mining and heterologous synthesis. Importantly, CYP450 CpsD mainly catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to generate an unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring scaffold through the formation of one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;N bonds, illuminating its first dimerase role in this family of natural products. The proposed catalytic mechanism of CpsD was deeply investigated by diversified substrate derivatization. Moreover, dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the global honeybee pest Galleria mellonella. Our study shows a representative example of discovering new skeleton monomeric and dimeric indole piperazine alkaloids from microbial resources, expands our knowledge of bond formation by CYP450s and supports further development of the newly discovered and engineered campesine family compounds as potential biopesticides.

CpsD catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to give a group of unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight-ring-scaffold heterodimeric compounds through the formation of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds. Dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the pest &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-catalyzed oxidative coupling is an efficient strategy for using simple building blocks to construct complex structural scaffolds of natural products. Among them, heterodimeric coupling between two different monomers is relatively scarce, and the corresponding CYP450s are largely undiscovered. In this study, we discovered a fungal CYP450 (CpsD) and its associated &lt;i&gt;cps&lt;/i&gt; cluster from 37208 CYP450s of Pfam PF00067 family member database and subsequently identified a group of new skeleton indole piperazine alkaloids (campesines A&#8722;G) by combination of genome mining and heterologous synthesis. Importantly, CYP450 CpsD mainly catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to generate an unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight-ring scaffold through the formation of one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;N bonds, illuminating its first dimerase role in this family of natural products. The proposed catalytic mechanism of CpsD was deeply investigated by diversified substrate derivatization. Moreover, dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the global honeybee pest &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt;. Our study shows a representative example of discovering new skeleton monomeric and dimeric indole piperazine alkaloids from microbial resources, expands our knowledge of bond formation by CYP450s and supports further development of the newly discovered and engineered campesine family compounds as potential biopesticides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Supporting Atomic Bi&#8722;N2O2 Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation effect and interlayer coordination of Bi3+ ions result in an oriented variation of the exposed crystal plane and the slight lattice strain of the original hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, forming a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework for high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single atomic catalysts (SACs) offer a superior platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to obtain well&#8208;defined and novel site configuration owing to the uncertainty of functional framework&#8208;derived SACs through calcination. Herein, a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported directly for CO2RR. In flow cell, the target catalyst Bi1&#8208;HOF maintains a faradaic efficiency (FE) HCOOH of over 90&#8201;% at a wide potential window of 1.4&#8197;V. The corresponding partial current density ranges from 113.3 to 747.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. And, Bi1&#8208;HOF exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of over 30&#8197;h under a successive potential&#8208;step test with a current density of 100&#8211;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density function theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of HOF effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from Bi center to CO2 molecule, reaching an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. Besides, this study offers a versatile method to reach series of M&#8722;N2O2 sites with regulable metal centers via the same intercalation mechanism, broadening the platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during CO2RR.

         <title>Robust Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production: Linkage Position Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>

The linkage position matters: Changing para&#8208; to ortho&#8208;position linkage in covalent organic framework photocatalysts results in a high hydrogen peroxide rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water without sacrificial reagents, and significantly improved long&#8208;term continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance from about 6 to 48&#8197;h.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. However, the nature of organic polymers makes the balance between high activity and stability challenging. We demonstrate that the linkage position matters in the design of robust COF photocatalysts with durable high activity without sacrificial reagents. COFs with ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;linkages (o&#8208;COFs and p&#8208;COFs) were constructed by 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol with benzene&#8208;, pyridine&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;orthodiamines and paradiamines. The pyrzaine&#8208;containing o&#8208;COFs with two pyridinic nitrogen atoms exhibited a H2O2 production rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 together with long&#8208;time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance in pure water (48&#8197;h), superior to the corresponding p&#8208;COFs. A four&#8208;step reaction mechanism is proposed by density function calculations. Moreover, the active sites and origin of stability enhancement for o&#8208;COFs are clarified. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy in the design of robust COF photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
Novel strong electron&#8208;accepting units for providing second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence with donor&#8211;acceptor polymers are presented. Introducing trifluoromethyl group to boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes improves both their electron&#8208;accepting ability and solubility. Owing to their bulky structures and excellent light&#8208;absorption ability, bright NIR&#8208;II fluorescence is observed from polymer solutions, films, and nanoparticles.







Abstract
Luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1,000&#8211;1,700&#8197;nm) window is beneficial especially for deep tissue imaging and optical sensors because of intrinsic high permeability through various media. Strong electron&#8208;acceptors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are a crucial unit for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) with the NIR&#8208;II emission property, however, limited kinds of molecular skeletons are still available. Herein, D&#8211;A CPs involving fluorinated boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes (BAz) with enhanced electron&#8208;accepting properties are reported. Combination of fluorination at the azobenzene ligand and trifluoromethylation at the boron can effectively lower the LUMO energy level down to &#8722;4.42&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of conventional strong electron&#8208;acceptors. The synthesized series of CPs showed excellent absorption/fluorescence property in solution over a wide NIR range including NIR&#8208;II. Furthermore, owing to the inherent solid&#8208;state emissive property of the BAz skeleton, obvious NIR&#8208;II fluorescence from the film (up to &#955;FL=1213&#8197;nm) and the nanoparticle in water (&#955;FL=1036&#8197;nm, brightness=up to 29&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;M&#8722;1) were observed, proposing that our materials are applicable for developing next&#8208;generation of NIR&#8208;II luminescent materials.

Liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with mechanically tunable circularly polarized luminance (CPL) were fabricated by in situ chemical cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed polymerizable CsPbX3 PQD nanomonomers into cholesteric elastic networks. This work can pave an avenue for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in dynamic information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.







Abstract
Endowing perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) offers great promise for innovative chiroptical applications, but the existing strategies are inefficient in acquiring stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible chiral perovskite films with large, tunable dissymmetry factor (glum) and long&#8208;term stability. Here, we report a strategy for the design and synthesis of luminescent cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (Lumin&#8208;CLCE) films with mechanically tunable CPL, which is enabled by liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral self&#8208;assembly and in situ covalent cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed photopolymerizable CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) PQD nanomonomers into the elastic polymer networks. The resulting Lumin&#8208;CLCE films showcase circularly polarized structural color in natural light and noticeable CPL with a maximum glum value of up to 1.5 under UV light. The manipulation of CPL intensity and rotation direction is achieved by controlling the self&#8208;assembled helicoidal nanostructure and the handedness of soft helices. A significant breakthrough lies in the achievement of a reversible, mechanically tunable perovskite&#8208;based CPL switch activated by biaxial stretching, which enables flexible, dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels capable of decrypting preset information in specific polarization states. This work can provide new insights for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Isomerization of Borylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes Enabled by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>

Sorbic acid&#8208;based C5 units are ubiquitous in natural products. To complement biosynthesis algorithms, a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization of &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted dienes has been achieved by selective energy transfer catalysis (E&#8201;:&#8201;Z up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Application of the method in stereospecific [4+2] and [2+2] cycloaddition processes is also disclosed to generate cyclic products with four contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
Configurationally&#8208;defined dienes are pervasive across the bioactive natural product spectrum, where they typically manifest themselves as sorbic acid&#8208;based fragments. These C5 motifs reflect the biosynthesis algorithms that facilitate their construction. To complement established biosynthetic paradigms, a chemical platform to facilitate the construction of stereochemically defined, functionalizable dienes by light&#8208;enabled isomerization has been devised. Enabled by selective energy transfer catalysis, a variety of substituted &#946;&#8208;boryl sorbic acid derivatives can be isomerized in a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3). Directionality is guided by a stabilizing nO&#8594;pB interaction in the product: this constitutes a formal anti&#8208;hydroboration of the starting alkyne. This operationally simple reaction employs low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and is complete in 1&#8197;h. X&#8208;ray analysis supports the hypothesis that the nO&#8594;pB interaction leads to chromophore bifurcation: this provides a structural foundation for selective energy transfer.

         <title>Regulated Dual Defects of Bridging Organic and Terminal Inorganic Ligands in Iron&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nodes for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulated dual defects of bridging organic ligands and terminal ligands of hydroxyls (OH&#8722;) and H2O induce the formation of exposed coordinatively unsaturated Fe centers as active sites in a Fe&#8208;based MOF catalyst, resulting in the efficient activation of inert N2 molecules and thus the enhanced photocatalytic NH3 production.







Abstract
Engineering advantageous defects to construct well&#8208;defined active sites in catalysts is promising but challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O due to the chemical inertness of N2 molecule. Here, we report defective Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalysts via a non&#8208;thermal plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where their NH3 production capability is synergistically regulated by two types of defects, namely, bridging organic ligands and terminal inorganic ligands (OH&#8722; and H2O). Specially, the optimized MIL&#8208;100(Fe) catalysts, where there are only terminal inorganic ligand defects and coexistence of dual defects, exhibit the respective 1.7&#8208; and 7.7&#8208;fold activity enhancement comparable to the pristine catalyst under visible light irradiation. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the dual defects in the catalyst induce the formation of abundant and highly accessible coordinatively unsaturated Fe active sites and synergistically optimize their geometric and electronic structures, which favors the injection of more d&#8208;orbital electrons in Fe sites into the N2 &#960;* antibonding orbital to achieve N2 activation and the formation of a key intermediate *NNH in the reaction. This work provides a guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of porous catalysts with precise defective structures for high&#8208;performance activation of catalytic molecules.

         <title>Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with Approaching 20&#8201;% Efficiency and Improved Photostability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells with approaching 20% efficiency and improved photostability were fabricated by incorporating a new trimeric guest acceptor named Tri&#8208;V into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X binary blend, wherein Tri&#8208;V can effectively restrict the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X, thus leading to favorable phase&#8208;separation morphology and desirable molecular packing.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) processed from non&#8208;halogenated solvents is crucially important for their scale&#8208;up industry production. However, owing to the difficulty of regulating molecular aggregation, there is a huge efficiency gap between non&#8208;halogenated and halogenated solvent processed OSCs. Herein, we fabricate o&#8208;xylene processed OSCs with approaching 20&#8201;% efficiency by incorporating a trimeric guest acceptor named Tri&#8208;V into the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X host blend. The incorporation of Tri&#8208;V effectively restricts the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X, regulates the molecular packing and optimizes the phase&#8208;separation morphology, which leads to mitigated trap density states, reduced energy loss and suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X:Tri&#8208;V&#8208;based device achieves an efficiency of 19.82&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency for non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs reported to date. Noticeably, with the addition of Tri&#8208;V, the ternary device shows an improved photostability than binary PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X&#8208;based device, and maintains 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 1380&#8197;h. This work provides a feasible approach for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency, stable, eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, and sheds new light on the large&#8208;scale industrial production of OSCs.

Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312, DOI: 10.1002/anie.202317312), regarding the multireference character (MRC) of our proposed cluster. Their argument is based on small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, fractional occupation density (FOD) and CASPT2(12,13) calculations. They also proposed that the singlet planar In4H+ cluster cannot be observed. We present our calculations which reveals that some of their arguments are based on wrong interpretation of data and inadequate use of methodology. While we certainly agree with the strong physical ground of FOD, CASSF and CASPT2 methodology, we believe that such analysis for clusters is not adequate.

&lt;p&gt;Detailed electronic structure analysis of the global minimum geometry of In&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cluster having a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom reveal that the proposal by Huo et&#8197;al. having multi-reference character is over ambiguous.

Multi&#8208;configurational second&#8208;order perturbation theory calculations revealed that the low&#8208;lying isomers of In4H+ reported by Kalita et&#8197;al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312) all showed the obvious multi&#8208;reference characters and the desired D4h isomer with a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) was only the fifth lowest isomer, which was 5.05&#8197;kcal/mol higher than the global minimum in C4v symmetry and having a quasi&#8208;ptH, so the perfect ptH cannot be observed in In4H+ system.







Abstract
In a recent communication (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312), Kalita et&#8197;al. studied In4H+ system within the frame of single&#8208;reference approximation (SRA) and found that the global energy minimum (1&#8201;a) adopted the singlet state and a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH), while the second lowest isomer (1&#8201;b) located 3.0&#8197;kcal/mol above 1&#8201;a and adopted the triplet state as well as non&#8208;planar structure with a quasi&#8208;ptH. They assessed the reliability of SRA by checking the T1&#8208;diagnostic values of coupled cluster calculations. However, according to our multi&#8208;configurational second&#8208;order perturbation theory calculations at the CASPT2(12,13)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVQZ (aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP for In) level, both 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibit obvious multi&#8208;referential characters, as reflected by their largest reference coefficients of 0.928 (86.1&#8201;%) and 0.938 (88.0&#8201;%), respectively. Moreover, 1&#8201;b is 5.05&#8197;kcal/mol lower than 1&#8201;a at this level, that is, what can be observed in In4H+ system is the quasi&#8208;ptH.

CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems are activated by the formation of a ribonucleoprotein and its binding to the target nucleic acid sequence. Both binding processes are important for the overall performance. In their Communication (e202404069) Hongquan Zhang, X.&#8197;Chris Le et&#8197;al. describe a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the activation of Cas13a by its RNA target. The method can unravel and quantify the kinetics of activation and enzymatic cleavage in a dynamic system. Artwork created by Jeffrey Tao.

A bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) strategy opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products. In their Communication (e202402886), Weiwei Tang et&#8197;al. report a novel crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization method using BCA that demonstrates the dual functions of cocrystallization and catalytic racemization. This BCA strategy could address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reaction conditions.

In&#8208;silico screening of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is reported by Kazuhiro&#8197;J. Fujimoto, Takeshi Yanai, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202403829). Using a two&#8208;boron&#8208;doping/two&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fusion strategy anchored on the perylene scaffold, comprehensive structure generation followed by DFT calculations produces promising candidates. The validity of this approach is underscored by the experimental synthesis of dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene, showcasing intense NIR&#8208;emission.

         <title>Towards More Sustainable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) generally display high safety and environmental friendliness. However, their large&#8208;scale applications will generate huge amounts of depleted batteries, leading to environmental concern and resource waste. Therefore, the sustainability of AZIBs have to highly considered. This minireview aims to make AZIBs more sustainable from the focus on material design and their recycling techniques, including active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes, and aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as the promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, low cost and environmental benignity. The large&#8208;scale applications of AZIBs will inevitably result in a large amount of spent AZIBs, which not only induce the waste of resources, but also pose environmental risks. Therefore, sustainable AZIBs have to be considered to minimize the risk of environmental pollution and maximize the utilization of spent compounds. Herein, this minireview focuses on the sustainability of AZIBs from material design and recycling techniques. The structure and degradation mechanism of AZIBs are discussed to guide the recycling design of the materials. Subsequently, the sustainability of component materials in AZIBs is further analysed to pre&#8208;evaluate their recycling behaviors and mentor the selection of more sustainable component materials, including active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes, and aqueous electrolytes, respectively. According to the features of component materials, corresponding green and economic approaches are further proposed to realize the recycling of active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes and electrolytes, respectively. These advanced technologies endow the recycling of component materials with high efficiency and a closed&#8208;loop control, ensuring that AZIBs will be the promising candidates of sustainable energy storage devices. This review will offer insight into potential future directions in the design of sustainable AZIBs.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks in Adsorption and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the fields of catalysis and adsorption for ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), highlighting the relationship between ionic structures and properties. The insights into the future development of design strategies and applications based on ionic COFs are also offered.







Abstract
The ion extraction and electro/photo catalysis are promising methods to address environmental and energy issues. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of promising template to construct absorbents and catalysts because of their stable frameworks, high surface areas, controllable pore environments, and well&#8208;defined catalytic sites. Among them, ionic COFs as unique class of crystalline porous materials, with charges in the frameworks or along the pore walls, have shown different properties and resulting performance in these applications with those from charge&#8208;neutral COFs. In this review, current research progress based on the ionic COFs for ion extraction and energy conversion, including cationic/anionic materials and electro/photo catalysis is reviewed in terms of the synthesis strategy, modification methods, mechanisms of adsorption and catalysis, as well as applications. Finally, we demonstrated the current challenges and future development of ionic COFs in design strategies and applications.

Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. This perspective aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application to enable bottlebrush physics to be more approachable.







Abstract
Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. While great strides have been made in our fundamental understanding of bottlebrush polymers and networks, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for the field to accelerate advancements. This review aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application (LengthScale), enabling bottlebrush physics to be more approachable. We conclude by addressing several topical issues and asking a series of pointed questions to stimulate conversation within the community.

         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the field of chemical RNA synthesis are discussed, starting with protection concepts, followed by selected nucleoside modifications that are challenging to incorporate into RNA. Comments on the chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs, the enzymatic ligation of synthetic RNA, and RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modifications using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functional groups complete this minireview.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play a vital role in living organisms. Many of their cellular functions depend critically on chemical modification. Methods to modify RNA in a controlled manner&#8212;both in vitro and in vivo&#8212;are thus essential to evaluate and understand RNA biology at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site&#8208;specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid&#8208;phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, N4&#8208;acetylcytidine, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytidine, 3&#8208;methylcytidine, 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3, and 2&#8242;&#8208;N3 ribose modifications. We also discuss the all&#8208;chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single&#8208;molecule FRET studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of 14N Nuclei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization of quadrupolar 14N nuclei was demonstrated for the first time. This was achieved using pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl moieties followed by polarization transfer from 1H to 14N nuclei using PH&#8208;INEPT pulse sequence. After optimization of interpulse delays by both simulations and experiments, up to 760&#8208;fold signal enhancement at 7&#8197;T was obtained.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization techniques provide a dramatic increase in sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. In spite of the outstanding progress in solution&#8208;state hyperpolarization of spin&#8208;1/2 nuclei, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar nuclei remains challenging. Here, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar 14N nuclei with natural isotopic abundance of &gt;99&#8201;% is demonstrated. This is achieved via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl unsaturated moieties followed by a subsequent polarization transfer from 1H to 14N nuclei at high magnetic field using PH&#8208;INEPT or PH&#8208;INEPT+ radiofrequency pulse sequence. Catalyst screening identified water&#8208;soluble rhodium complex [Rh(P(m&#8208;C6H4SO3Na)3)3Cl] as the most efficient catalyst for hyperpolarization of the substrates under study, providing up to 1.3&#8201;% and up to 6.6&#8201;% 1H polarization in the cases of vinyl and allyl precursors, respectively. The performance of PH&#8208;INEPT and PH&#8208;INEPT+ pulse sequences was optimized with respect to interpulse delays, and the resultant experimental dependences were in good agreement with simulations. As a result, 14N NMR signal enhancement of up to 760&#8208;fold at 7.05&#8197;T (corresponding to 0.15&#8201;% 14N polarization) was obtained.

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral Agent Enables One&#8208;pot Spontaneous Deracemization of Racemic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization method using a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) was developed. The BCA helps achieve the dual functions of catalytic racemization and cocrystallization with the resulting enantiomers (see picture). This method was successfully implemented for the deracemization of chiral drugs containing one or multiple stereocenters, thus extending current strategies to the enantioseparation of racemic compounds.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot deracemization method using a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) is proposed for the first time to convert a racemate to the desired enantiomer. Specifically, chiral &#945;, (&#945;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinemethanol) formed enantiospecific cocrystals with racemic dihydromyricetin, and used its own alkaline catalysis to catalyze the racemization between the (2R,3R)&#8208;enantiomer and (2S,3S)&#8208;enantiomer in solution, achieving a one&#8208;pot spontaneous deracemization. This strategy was also successfully extended to the deracemization of three other racemic compound drugs: (R,S)&#8208;carprofen, (R,S)&#8208;indoprofen, and (R,S)&#8208;indobufen. The one&#8208;pot deracemization method based on the BCA strategy provides a feasible approach to address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reactions that are commonly encountered in the cocrystallization&#8208;induced deracemization process and opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products with atom economy.

         <title>Na2C3O2: The First Crystalline Compound with the Elusive &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double deprotonation of propiolic acid yielded the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; anion, which coordinates to the sodium cation in crystalline Na2C3O2 both via its carboxylate group and via its acetylide unit in a Janus&#8208;faced manner.







Abstract
By reaction of sodium electride or NaC2H with the anhydrous sodium salt of propiolic acid, Na(OOC&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;H), in liquid ammonia crystalline powders of Na2C3O2 were obtained. The structure analysis based on synchrotron powder diffraction data revealed that Na2C3O2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (I2/a, Z=4) exhibiting the elusive Y&#8208;shaped &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; anion, which is unprecedented in a crystalline compound up to now. IR/Raman and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic investigations with assignments supported by DFT&#8208;based ab initio calculations confirm this finding. Reaction with sodium electride led to a higher crystallinity of the product, but additionally a by&#8208;product apparently due to decomposition and polymerization of Na2C3O2 was formed. No such by&#8208;product was observed in the reaction with NaC2H, which turned out to be a milder metalation route. However, the product of the latter reaction is less crystalline.

Time&#8208;resolved tandem catalysis: Palladium catalyzes the regioselective Heck reaction between A and B, while triflic acid mediates the skeleton rearrangement of the resulting Heck products D to dihydrofurans C.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols, the reactivity of 3&#8208;vinylazetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols 1 and 3&#8208;vinyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;ols 2 under transition metal catalysis remains largely unexplored. We report herein their unique reactivity under dual palladium and acid catalysis. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2(PPh3)2, AgTFA and triflic acid, the reaction of 1 or 2 with aryl iodides affords 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydrofurans, which are valuable heterocycles in organic synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that this arylative ring&#8208;expansion reaction proceeds via a domino process involving Heck arylation of alkene, acid&#8208;catalyzed transposition of allylic alcohol and ring opening of the azetidine/oxetane by an internal hydroxyl group.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Allylation of Indoles with gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective allylation of indoles with gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes is developed under rhodium catalysis. The reaction shows exceptional branched regioselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity with a bulky ligand, which provides an efficient route to enantioenriched C2 and C3 fluoroallylated indoles with wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The use of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) as fluoroallyl surrogates under transition&#8208;metal catalysis has drawn considerable attention recently but such reactions are restricted to producing achiral or racemic mono&#8208;fluoroalkenes. Herein, we report the first enantioselective allylation of indoles under rhodium catalysis with gem&#8208;DFCPs. This reaction shows exceptional branched regioselectivity towards rhodium catalysis with gem&#8208;DFCPs, which provides an efficient route to enantioenriched fluoroallylated indoles with wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Photoactivated Circularly Polarized Luminescent Organic Radicals in Doped Amorphous Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated CPL radicals are developed by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system. The photoactivated luminescent radicals display a robust quantum yield of 57.8% and the dissymmetry factor of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. As a result, information displays, flexible objects and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are successfully prepared.







Abstract
Luminescent organic radicals, especially those with photoactivated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features, hold great significance for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications, but their development still remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to achieve photoactivated CPL radicals by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system, yielding a compound of R/S&#8208;5,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bibenzo[d][1,3]dioxole (R/S&#8208;BDP). The photoactivated R/S&#8208;BDP molecules in polymer matrix display a robust quantum yield of 19.8&#8201;% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;4, marking this work as the first example of photoactivated CPL radicals. Furthermore, the glum is improved to 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2 by using a liquid crystal as host. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that R/S&#8208;BDP molecules, endowed with double phosphine cores in axial chirality, offer a direct way for intramolecular electron transfer upon photoirradiation. This leads to the generation of radical ionic pairs, which subsequently trigger the donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement through intermolecular electron transfer, thereby resulting in stable radical emission. The extended photoactivated BDP&#8208;F exhibits a remarkably high quantum efficiency of 57.8%. Ultimately, the distinctive photo&#8208;responsive CPL radical luminescence has been successfully used for information displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Constructing &#960;&#8211;&#960; Superposition Effect of Tetralithium Naphthalenetetracarboxylate with Electron Delocalization for Robust Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductive network composites i.e. carbon nanotubes interwoven tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate achieve great lithium&#8208;ion storage performance due to the multiple conjugated carboxyls, great electron delocalization in naphthalene and extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect from the interface.







Abstract
Organics are gaining significance as electrode materials due to their merits of multi&#8208;electron reaction sites, flexible rearrangeable structures and redox reversibility. However, organics encounter finite electronic conductivity and inferior durability especially in organic electrolytes. To circumvent above barriers, we propose a novel design strategy, constructing conductive network structures with extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect by manipulating intermolecular interaction. Tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate (LNTC) interwoven by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forms LNTC@CNTs composite firstly for Li&#8208;ion storage, where multiple conjugated carboxyls contribute sufficient Li&#8208;ion storage sites, the unique network feature enables electrolyte and charge mobility conveniently combining electron delocalization in &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect between LNTC and CNTs endows laudable structural robustness. Accordingly, LNTC@CNTs maintain an excellent Li&#8208;ion storage capacity retention of 96.4&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles. Electrochemical experiments and theoretical simulations elucidate the fast reaction kinetics and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage stability owing to the electron delocalization and &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect, while conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates during charging/discharging. Consequently, a dual&#8208;ion battery combining this composite anode and expanded graphite cathode exhibits a peak specific capacity of 122&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long cycling life with a capacity retention of 84.2&#8201;% after 900&#8197;cycles.

         <title>In Silico Screening and Experimental Verification of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Two&#8208;Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in silico screening method based on a comprehensive structure generation followed by TD&#8208;DFT calculations was established for developing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Using perylene as a scaffold, a two&#8208;boron&#8208;doping/two&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fusion strategy was applied to provide ca. 2500 possible structures. One of the promising candidates, extracted using several criteria, was synthesized and exhibited intense NIR&#8208;emission.







Abstract
Embedding two boron atoms into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leads to the formation of a neutral analogue that is isoelectronic to the corresponding dicationic PAH skeleton, which can significantly alter its electronic structure. Based on this concept, we explore herein the identification of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive PAHs with the aid of an in silico screening method. Using perylene as the PAH scaffold, we embedded two boron atoms and fused two thiophene rings to it. Based on this design concept, all possible structures (ca. 2500 entities) were generated using a comprehensive structure generator. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations were conducted on all these structures, and promising candidates were extracted based on the vertical excitation energy, transition dipole moment, and atomization energy per bond. One of the extracted dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene candidates was synthesized and indeed exhibited emission at 724&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 0.40 in toluene, demonstrating the validity of this screening method. This modification was further applied to other PAHs, and a series of thienobora&#8208;modified PAHs was synthesized.

         <title>Final Stages in the Biosynthesis of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final stages of the biosynthesis of the [FeFe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases are elucidated by a combination of organometallic synthesis and biophysical analysis. The complex [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; containing the unprecedented aminomethylthiolate ligand, allows maturation of HydA1 in the presence of HydF and the established cocktail of reagents and proteins. The same complex maturates HydA1 using a simplified protein&#8208;free recipe.







Abstract
The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The recently hypothesized intermediate [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; ([1]2&#8722;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe2(S2)(CN)(CO)5]&#8722;. The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CNBEt3)(CO)5]&#8722;, [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)&#8722;(CO)5]&#8722;, and [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722;, where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]+, PPh4+ and PPN+ salts as well as the 13CD2&#8208;isotopologues. These Fe2 species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial&#8208;equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur. In vitro experiments demonstrate that [1]2&#8722; maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.

     alt="Final Stages in the Biosynthesis of the [FeFe]-Hydrogenase Active Site"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stages of the biosynthesis of the [FeFe]&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; active site of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases are elucidated by a combination of organometallic synthesis and biophysical analysis. The complex [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; containing the unprecedented aminomethylthiolate ligand, allows maturation of HydA1 in the presence of HydF and the established cocktail of reagents and proteins. The same complex maturates HydA1 using a simplified protein-free recipe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; active site of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The recently hypothesized intermediate [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ([&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(CN)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHFmoc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CNBEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHFmoc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&#8722;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHFmoc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18-crown-6)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PPN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salts as well as the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-isotopologues. These Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial-equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur. In vitro experiments demonstrate that [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes Fabricated on Flexible Polymer Supports for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy gives metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes with areas over 2,400&#8197;cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm). Three spiral wound membrane modules with an area of 4,800&#8197;cm2 were prepared. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).







Abstract
Ultrathin continuous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes have the potential to achieve high gas permeance and selectivity simultaneously for otherwise difficult gas separations, but with few exceptions for zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) membranes, current methods cannot conveniently realize practical large&#8208;area fabrication. Here, we propose a ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy for preparing large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes on flexible polymeric support layers. The bipolymer directs metal ions to form a cross&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network with a uniform distribution of metal ions on support layers. Ligand back diffusion controls the feed of ligand molecules available for nuclei formation, resulting in the continuous growth of large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes. We report the practical fabrication of three representative defect&#8208;free MOF membranes with areas larger than 2,400&#8197;cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm), including ZIFs and carboxylate&#8208;linker MOFs. Among these, the ZIF&#8208;8 membrane displays high gas permeance of 3,979&#8197;GPU for C3H6, with good mixed gas selectivity (43.88 for C3H6/C3H8). To illustrate its scale&#8208;up practicality, MOF membranes were prepared and incorporated into spiral&#8208;wound membrane modules with an active area of 4,800&#8197;cm2. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).

         <title>A Sensitive Technique Unravels the Kinetics of Activation and Trans&#8208;Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method enables kinetic studies of the binding (kobs, kon, koff, and Kd) and trans&#8208;cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems, which reveals that once the crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is activated by its binding with the RNA activator, the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas13a is sustained over a broad temperature range (7&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C). Cas13a at the ambient temperature is useful for transcriptomic and diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Activation of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system requires the formation of a crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and the binding of an RNA activator to the RNP. These two binding processes play a crucial role in the performance of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system. However, the binding kinetics remain poorly understood, and a main challenge is the lack of a sensitive method for real&#8208;time measurements of the dynamically formed active CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a enzyme. We describe here a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding between Cas13a and its activator. The method is able to unravel and quantify the kinetics of binding and cleavage separately, on the basis of measuring the real&#8208;time trans&#8208;cleavage rates of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system and obtaining the real&#8208;time concentrations of the active CRISPR&#8208;Cas ternary complex. We further discovered that once activated, the Cas13a system operates at a wide range of temperatures (7&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C) with fast trans&#8208;cleavage kinetics. The new method and findings are important for diverse applications of the Cas13a system, such as the demonstrated quantification of microRNA at ambient temperatures (e.g., 25&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Spiroaminals via Chiral Bifunctional Hydrogen Bonding Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals via chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance.







Abstract
Spiroaminals represent novel structural motifs prevalent in diverse natural products and biologically active molecules. Achieving their enantioselective synthesis is a highly desirable and challenging task in synthetic endeavors due to their intricate molecular frameworks. Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals using chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the possible stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance. Additionally, we validated the scalability of the reaction and demonstrated the synthesis of variable spiroaminal scaffolds, confirming the viability of our protocol.

         <title>Enabling Closed&#8208;Loop Circularity of &#8220;Non&#8208;Polymerizable&#8221; &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Conjugated Lactone Towards High&#8208;Performance Polyester with the Assistance of Cyclopentadiene</title>

For &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; &#945;, &#946;&#8208;conjugated lactone, 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (DPO), cyclopentadiene is used as the &#8220;chaperone&#8221; to assist the polymerization of the monomer via simple Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and its retro reaction. The exclusive presence of trans C=C double bond make the polymer PDPO exhibit enhanced thermal properties, with much higher Tm value and thermal stability than its structural anologue, PVL. Finally, the polymer PDPO undergoes ring&#8208;closing metathesis and recycles back to its original monomer, enabling the closed&#8208;loop circularity of &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; DPO.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to monomers presents a promising solution to the escalating crisis associated with plastic waste. Despite considerable progress made in this field, the primary efforts have been focused on redesigning new monomers to produce readily recyclable polymers. In contrast, limited research into the potential of seemingly &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; monomers has been conducted. Herein, we propose a paradigm that leverages a &#8220;chaperone&#8221;&#8208;assisted strategy to establish closed&#8208;loop circularity for a &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; &#945;, &#946;&#8208;conjugated lactone, 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (DPO). The resulting PDPO, a structural analogue of poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) (PVL), exhibits enhanced thermal properties with a melting point (Tm) of 114&#8201;&#176;C and a decomposition temperature (Td,5%) of 305&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, owing to the structural similarity between DPO and &#948;&#8208;VL, the copolymerization generates semi&#8208;crystalline P(DPO&#8208;co&#8208;VL)s irrespective of the DPO incorporation ratio. Intriguingly, the inherent C=C bonds in P(DPO&#8208;co&#8208;VL)s enable their convenient post&#8208;functionalization via Michael&#8208;addition reaction. Lastly, PDPO was demonstrated to be chemically recyclable via ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), representing a significant step towards the pursuit of enabling the closed&#8208;loop circularity of &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; lactones without altering the ultimate polymer structure.

         <title>Stepwise Dissipative Control of Multimodal Motion in a Silver(I) Catenate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not one, not two, not three, but four! Filling four receptor sites with Ag+ as chemical fuel is the key to the transient and successive self&#8208;assembly of two multicomponent devices. While the first device displays two nanomechanical movements (shuttling and sliding), the second exhibits a sliding motion at increased speed.







Abstract
Stepwise dissipative control of two distinct motions, i.e., shuttling and sliding, is demonstrated in a single multicomponent device. When [2]rotaxane 1, which acts as a biped, and deck 2 were treated with AgBF4/PhCH2Br+NEt3 as chemical fuel, the transient catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ was instantly generated showing multimodal motion and autonomous return to 1 and 2. In the dissipative process, catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ cleanly transformed into the follow&#8208;up transient device (1)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ exhibiting only sliding motion. Two interference&#8208;free dissipative cycles proved the resilience and robustness of the process.

         <title>Dynamic Chalcogen Squares for Material and Topological Control over Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce and entirely new dynamic, non&#8208;covalent bonding interaction based on selenadiazole chalcogen squares which are capable of tuning bulk glass transition temperature, increase toughness, imbue self&#8208;healing abilities, and control hydrodynamic diameter of solvated macromolecular architectures. All of these properties can be accessed via a single selenadiazole containing molecule, easily and quickly incorporated into a broad array of polymer systems via Passerini and Biginelli multicomponent reactions.







Abstract
Herein we introduce chalcogen squares via selenadiazole motifs as a new class of dynamic supramolecular bonding interactions for the modification and control of soft matter materials. We showcase selenadiazole motifs in supramolecular networks of varying primary chain length prepared through polymerization using tandem step&#8208;growth/Passerini multicomponent reactions (MCRs). Compared to controls lacking the selenadiazole motif, these networks display increased glass transition temperatures and moduli due to the chalcogen bonding linkages formed between chains. These elastomeric networks were shown to autonomously heal at room temperature, retaining up to 83&#8201;% of the ultimate tensile strength. Lastly, we use post&#8208;polymerization modification via the Biginelli MCR to add selenadiazole motifs to narrowly dispersed polymers for controlled topology in solution. Chalcogen squares via selenadiazoles introduce an exciting exchange mechanism to the realm of dynamic materials.

         <title>Bis(Aluminyl)Magnesium: A Source of Nucleophilic or Radical Aluminium&#8208;Centred Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]2 reacts thermally with MeI via nucleophilic attack through Al, consistent with a formal description as an Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic species. Under photolytic activation, reaction with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene leads to the transannular cycloaddition products, consistent with radical chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as an Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) synthon.







Abstract
The homoleptic magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) can be accessed from K2[Al(NON)]2 and MgI2 and shown to possess a non&#8208;linear geometry (&#8736;Al&#8722;Mg&#8722;Al=164.8(1)&#176;) primarily due to the influence of dispersion interactions. This compound acts a four&#8208;electron reservoir in the reductive de&#8208;fluorination of SF6, and reacts thermally with polar substrates such as MeI via nucleophilic attack through aluminium, consistent with the QT&#8208;AIM charges calculated for the metal centres, and a formal description as a Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic. On the other hand, under photolytic activation, the reaction with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene leads to the stereo&#8208;selective generation of transannular cycloaddition products consistent with radical based chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as a Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) synthon. Consistently, photolysis of Mg[Al(NON)]2 in hexane in the absence of COD generates [Al(NON)]2 together with magnesium metal.

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8211;OH&#8211;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8211;OH&#8211;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8211;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysis for sensitive sensing platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Alkynylated Fluorescent Flippers:&#160; Altered Ultrafast Photophysics to Track Thick Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems.&#160; This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains.&#160; The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. &#160;Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression.&#160; Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity.&#160; In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence.&#160; Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of 1&#8208;Octene with [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene as non&#8208;activated model substrate with neutral water as H&#8208;donor is reported, using [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] (1) as the catalyst, to form octane with high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96% and a kobs of 87 s&#8211;1. Cyclic voltammetry with 1 revealed that two subsequent reductions trigger the elimination of Cl&#8211; and afford the highly reactive anionic Ir(I) hydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)]&#8211; (2), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of 1 in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)2] (3) in 88% FE from the reaction of 2 with H2O. Complex 3 then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro&#8208;hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H2 formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu4NOH added), the electro&#8208;hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene with 1 also proceeds cleanly (89% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H2O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H+ reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H2O as a key step in this context.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y&#8208;Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface structure and chemical properties of Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well&#8208;controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization&#8208;resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y&#8208;doped&#160; ZrO2 single&#8208;crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D2O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red&#8208;shifted CO band at 2132 cm&#8208;1. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the vicinity of doping&#8208;induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where &#160;only associative adsorption was observed.&#160; Together with a novel analysis scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ&#8208;based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficiency Co&#8208;Production of Benzoquinone and H2 by Resourcing Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions.&#160;Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35 V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction&#160;(EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation&#160;in an alkaline medium&#160;and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60 V was applied to produce a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90 V for 12 days, showing remarkable long&#8208;term stability. The unique configuration of the acid&#8208;base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;DNA Carriers Co&#8208;Deliver Photosensitizer and siRNA for Light&#8208;Promoted Gene Transfection and Hypoxia&#8208;Relieved Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Complex&#8208;Templated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry for the Selection and Identification of Homo&#8208;PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry meets PROTAC screening: Stability of ternary complexes formed by PROTACs is shown to act as selection criterion in multi&#8208;protein templated dynamic combinatorial libraries. Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry allows rapid identification of novel VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs from complex library mixtures.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) leverages a reversible reaction to generate compound libraries from constituting building blocks under thermodynamic control. The position of this equilibrium can be biased by addition of a target macromolecule towards enrichment of bound ligands. While DCC has been applied to select ligands for a single target protein, its application to identifying chimeric molecules inducing proximity between two proteins is unprecedented. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we develop a DCC approach to select bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) based on their ability to stabilize the ternary complex. We focus on VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs as model system, and show that the formation of a VHL2&#8201;:&#8201;Homo&#8208;PROTAC ternary complex reversibly assembled using thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry leads to amplification of potent VHL Homo&#8208;PROTACs with degradation activities which correlated well with their biophysical ability to dimerize VHL. Ternary complex templated dynamic combinatorial libraries allowed identification of novel Homo&#8208;PROTAC degraders. We anticipate future applications of ternary&#8208;complex directed DCC to early PROTAC screenings and expansion to other proximity&#8208;inducing modalities beyond PROTACs.

         <title>Reversal of the Regioselectivity of Iron&#8208;Promoted Hydrogenation and Hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described an unprecedented iron&#8208;promoted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes in reversed regioselectivity for the generation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation and halogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated, chlorodifluoromethylated, bromodifluoromethylate and iododifluoromethylated products respectively. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The reaction regioselectivity of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes is dependent on the intrinsic polarity. Thus, the reversal of the regioselectivity of the addition reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we described an unprecedented reversal of regioselectivity of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes triggered by Fe&#8722;H species for the formation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated products. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity of this scenario, leading to the formation of a less stable &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical regioisomer. On basis of this new reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, the iron&#8208;promoted hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the efficient synthesis of aliphatic chlorodifluoromethyl&#8208;, bromodifluoromethyl&#8208; and iododifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds was developed. Particularly, this novel hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes provided an effect and large&#8208;scale access to various iododifluoromethylated compounds of high value for synthetic application.

Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity of this scenario, leading to the formation of a less stable &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkyl radical regioisomer. On basis of this new reaction of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkene, the iron-promoted hydrohalogenation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes for the efficient synthesis of aliphatic chlorodifluoromethyl-, bromodifluoromethyl- and iododifluoromethyl-containing compounds was developed. Particularly, this novel hydrohalogenation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes provided an effect and large-scale access to various iododifluoromethylated compounds of high value for synthetic application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Energy&#8208;Funneling Kinetics in Nanocrystal Sublattices for Superior X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4: Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystals were explored through precise microenvironment engineering within nanocrystal sublattices. The resulting tailorable radioluminescence afterglow enabled high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultralong optical memory.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting radioluminescence scintillators have recently attracted substantial attention from both research and industrial communities, primarily due to their distinctive capabilities of converting and storing X&#8208;ray energy. However, determination of energy&#8208;conversion kinetics in these nanocrystals remains unexplored. Here we present a strategy to probe and unveil energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4:Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystal sublattices through Gd3+&#8208;driven microenvironment engineering and Mn2+&#8208;mediated radioluminescence profiling. Our photophysical studies reveal effective control of energy&#8208;funneling kinetics and demonstrate the tunability of electron trap depth ranging from 0.66 to 0.96&#8197;eV, with the corresponding trap density varying between 2.38&#215;105 and 1.34&#215;107&#8197;cm&#8722;3. This enables controlled release of captured electrons over durations spanning from seconds to 30&#8197;days. It allows tailorable emission wavelength within the range of 520&#8211;580&#8197;nm and fine&#8208;tuning of thermally&#8208;stimulated temperature between 313&#8211;403&#8197;K. We further utilize these scintillators to fabricate high&#8208;density, large&#8208;area scintillation screens that exhibit a 6&#8208;fold improvement in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, 22 lp/mm high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, and a 30&#8208;day&#8208;long optical memory. This enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of injured mice through fast thermally&#8208;stimulated radioluminescence readout. These findings offer new insights into the correlation of radioluminescence dynamics with energy&#8208;funneling kinetics, thereby contributing to the advancement of high&#8208;energy nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Inducible and Photoactivatable Cellular RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines the CRISPR/dCas13b and chemical induced proximity (CIP) techniques to develop a small molecule&#8208;induced photo&#8208;controllable m1A demethylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A) as well as an m1A methylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;m1A). These m1A editing tools are able to regulate the biological function of targeted RNAs by modulating m1A modifications, which in turn influences cell functions.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.

         <title>Unveiling Crucial Chemical Processing Parameters Influencing the Performance of Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical changes occur throughout the entire process of producing thermoelectric materials from particles in solution. Especially during the purification steps, which consequently influences the materials composition, microstructure and ultimately results in variations in the transport properties. Understanding the chemistry that occurs is crucial for material optimization and reproducibility.







Abstract
Production of thermoelectric materials from solution&#8208;processed particles involves the synthesis of particles, their purification and densification into pelletized material. Chemical changes that occur during each one of these steps render them performance determining. Particularly the purification steps, bypassed in conventional solid&#8208;state synthesis, are the cause for large discrepancies among similar solution&#8208;processed materials. In present work, the investigation focuses on a water&#8208;based surfactant free solution synthesis of SnSe, a highly relevant thermoelectric material. We show and rationalize that the number of leaching steps, purification solvent, annealing, and annealing atmosphere have significant influence on the Sn&#8201;:&#8201;Se ratio and impurity content in the powder. Such compositional changes that are undetectable by conventional characterization techniques lead to distinct consolidated materials with different types and concentration of defects. Additionally, the profound effect on their transport properties is demonstrated. We emphasize that understanding the chemistry and identifying key chemical species and their role throughout the process is paramount for optimizing material performance. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive reporting of these steps as a standard practice to ensure material reproducibility.

         <title>A Dicopper(II)&#8208;Based Carbonic Anhydrase Model&#8212;Quantum&#8208;Chemical Evaluation of the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of ascidians produces large amounts of patellamides, known to form dinuclear copper(II) complexes, which are efficient carbonic anhydrases. However, at the pH in the ascidians, catalysis is shown to be product&#8208;inhibited. All data available support the hypothesis that the function of the patellamides is to transport carbonate from the ascidian to the photosynthetically active symbiont Prochloron.







Abstract
The cyanobacterium Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of different species of colonial ascidians, occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, produces a variety of cyclic peptides. These patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles lead to relatively stable dicopper(II) complexes that are extremely efficient carbonic anhydrase mimics, the most active model systems known so far. Importantly, it recently was shown that copper(II) is coordinated to patellamide derivatives in Prochloron cells. An interesting question therefore is, whether the biological function of patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles is related to the catalytic activity in CO2 hydration or its reverse. Here, we present a computational study to evaluate the energetics of the catalytic cycle in search of a possible answer to these questions and compare the computed energy barriers with the experimental kinetic data. It emerges that release of the bridging carbonate is a critical step and that the catalysis product inhibits catalysis at pH values above approx.&#8197;7. Therefore, carbonate transport rather than CO2 hydrolysis is proposed as the biological function of copper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes in the Prochloron&#8208;Ascidian symbiosis.

         <title>Regulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics by Coupling Photocatalysis for High&#8208;Performance Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PA&#8208;LSBs) exhibit outstanding performance through the selective catalysis mechanism of photocatalysis. The PHK composite cathode demonstrates exceptional solar energy conversion capabilities. PA&#8208;LSBs showcase excellent rate performance, long cycling stability, and high areal capacity, emphasizing their practical potential for energy storage applications in this advanced materials context.







Abstract
Challenges such as shuttle effect have hindered the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), despite their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices. To address these issues, we explore the integration of solar energy into LSBs, creating a photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (PA&#8208;LSB). The PA&#8208;LSB provides a novel and sustainable solution by coupling the photocatalytic effect to accelerate sulfur redox reactions. Herein, a perovskite quantum dot&#8208;loaded MOF material serves as a cathode for the PA&#8208;LSB, creating built&#8208;in electric fields at the micro&#8208;interface to extend the lifetime of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. The band structure of the composite material aligns well with the electrochemical reaction potential of lithium&#8208;sulfur, enabling precise regulation of polysulfides in the cathode of the PA&#8208;LSB system. This is attributed to the selective catalysis of the liquid&#8208;solid reaction stage in the lithium&#8208;sulfur electrochemical process by photocatalysis. These contribute to the outstanding performance of PA&#8208;LSBs, particularly demonstrating a remarkably high reversible capacity of 679&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, maintaining stable cycling for 1500&#8197;cycles with the capacity decay rate of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle. Additionally, the photo&#8208;charging capability of the PA&#8208;LSB holds the potential to compensate for non&#8208;electric energy losses during the energy storage process, contributing to the development of lossless energy storage devices.

         <title>N&#8208;(Sulfonio)Sulfilimine Reagents: Non&#8208;Oxidizing Sources of Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom for Skeletal Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under rhodium catalysis N&#8208;sulfonio(sulfilimines) act as sulfonitrene precursors. Reaction of such species with indenes presumably delivers N&#8208;sulfonio aziridines, which evolve to isoquinolines via electrocyclic ring expansion. Contrarily, 1&#8208;arycyclobutenes are transformed into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes via ring contraction.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#955;4&#8208;dibenzothiophen&#8208;5&#8208;imino&#8208;N&#8208;dibenzothiophenium triflate (1) in multigram scale is reported. This compound reacts with Rh2(esp)2 (esp=&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedipropionic acid) generating a Rh&#8208;coordinated sulfonitrene species, which is able to transfer the electrophilic nitrene moiety to olefins. When indenes are used as substrates, isoquinolines are obtained in good yields. We assumed that after formation of the corresponding N&#8208;sulfonio aziridine, a ring expansion occurs via selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage and concomitant elimination of dibenzothiophene. Unexpectedly, a similar protocol transforms 1&#8208;arylcyclobutenes into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes. Our calculations indicate that aziridination is not favored in this case; instead, sulfilimine&#8208;substituted cyclobutyl carbocations are initially formed, and these evolve to the isolated cyclopropanes via ring contraction. Both procedures are operationally simple, tolerate a range of functional groups, including oxidation&#8208;sensitive alcohols and aldehydes, and enable the convenient preparation of valuable 15N&#8208;labelled products. These results demonstrate the potential of 1 to provide alternative pathways for the selective transfer of N&#8208;atoms in organic molecules.

         <title>Unified Approach to Deamination and Deoxygenation Through Isonitrile Hydrodecyanation: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol using isonitrile intermediates. Employing photoredox catalysis, a nucleophilic boryl radical mediates the scission of a relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, accomplishing deletion of the isonitrile group. This strategy applies to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing compounds and extends to the reduction of carbonyls, olefins, and alkyl nitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile. Rapid &#946;&#8208;scission then accomplishes defunctionalization. This method has been applied to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biomolecules. We extended this approach to the reduction of carbonyls and olefins to their saturated counterparts, as well as the hydrodecyanation of alkyl nitriles. Both experimental and computational studies demonstrate a facile &#946;&#8208;scission of the imidoyl radical, and reconcile differences in reactivity between nitriles and isonitriles within our protocol.

         <title>SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S&#8212;DABB Proteins Catalying Enantiospecific Hydrolysis of Organosilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, members of the DABB protein family, are the first two enzymes described that catalyse the enantiospecific hydrolysis of organosilyl ethers. They accept a wide range of substrates, including TBDMS&#8208;protected alcohols. The natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is still unknown, but their discovery paves the way towards a green and selective transformation of organosilane organosilanol substrates.







Abstract
Silyl ethers fulfil a fundamental role in synthetic organic chemistry as protecting groups and their selective cleavage is an important factor in their application. We present here for the first time two enzymes, SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, which are able to hydrolyse silyl ethers. They belong to the stress&#8208;response dimeric A/B barrel domain (DABB) family and are able to cleave the Si&#8722;O bond with opposite enantiopreference. Silyl ethers containing aromatic, cyclic or aliphatic alcohols and, depending on the alcohol moiety, silyl functions as large as TBDMS are accepted. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of SilE&#8722;R, determined to a resolution of 1.98&#8197;&#197;, in combination with mutational studies, revealed an active site featuring two histidine residues, H8 and H79, which likely act synergistically as nucleophile and Br&#248;nsted base in the hydrolytic mechanism, which has not previously been described for enzymes. Although the natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is unknown, we propose that these &#8216;silyl etherases&#8217; may have significant potential for synthetic applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Radical Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Alloxazine and Flavin through Ground&#8208;State Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of flavin analogues is desirable for property tuning but requires de novo synthesis. A synthetic strategy involving the introduction of a remote redox site followed by copper complexation turns an alloxazine and a flavin into redox&#8208;active structures and activates their aromatic ring for site&#8208;selective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. This unprecedented mechanism opens new vistas in the chemistry of flavins and analogues.







Abstract
Flavins and their alloxazine isomers are key chemical scaffolds for bioinspired electron transfer strategies. Their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by functional groups, which must be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis as their aromatic ring is inert towards post&#8208;functionalization. We show that the introduction of a remote metal&#8208;binding redox site on alloxazine and flavin activates their aromatic ring towards direct C&#8722;H functionalization. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a synthetic sequence involving ground&#8208;state single electron transfer (SET) with an electrophilic source followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling. This unprecedented reactivity opens new opportunities in molecular editing of flavins by direct aromatic post&#8208;functionalization and the utility of the method is demonstrated with the site&#8208;selective C6 functionalization of alloxazine and flavin with a CF3 group, Br or Cl, that can be further elaborated into OH and aryl for chemical diversification.

Their properties can be fine-tuned by functional groups, which must be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis as their aromatic ring is inert towards post-functionalization. We show that the introduction of a remote metal-binding redox site on alloxazine and flavin activates their aromatic ring towards direct C&#8722;H functionalization. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a synthetic sequence involving ground-state single electron transfer (SET) with an electrophilic source followed by radical-radical coupling. This unprecedented reactivity opens new opportunities in molecular editing of flavins by direct aromatic post-functionalization and the utility of the method is demonstrated with the site-selective C6 functionalization of alloxazine and flavin with a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, Br or Cl, that can be further elaborated into OH and aryl for chemical diversification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Indocyanine Green&#8208;Based Nanoprobe for In Vivo Detection of Cellular Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sound of Senescence: A nanostructured organic probe, NanoJaggs, can be used as photoacoustic contrast agent for in vivo imaging of the senescent cell burden in post&#8208;chemotherapy tumors. Made of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers, 30&#8197;nm nanoparticles exploit an active endocytosis mechanism and increase the number of lysosomes to specifically light up senescent cells implicated in cancer initiation and progression.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to improve conventional cancer&#8208;treatments by preventing detrimental side effects, cancer recurrence and metastases. Recent studies have shown that presence of senescent cells in tissues treated with chemo&#8208; or radiotherapy can be used to predict the effectiveness of cancer treatment. However, although the accumulation of senescent cells is one of the hallmarks of cancer, surprisingly little progress has been made in development of strategies for their detection in vivo. To address a lack of detection tools, we developed a biocompatible, injectable organic nanoprobe (NanoJagg), which is selectively taken up by senescent cells and accumulates in the lysosomes. The NanoJagg probe is obtained by self&#8208;assembly of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers using a scalable manufacturing process and characterized by a unique spectral signature suitable for both photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and fluorescence imaging. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable probe for detection of senescence and their PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescence burden in solid tumors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Click Synthesis of Multisugar&#8208;Modified Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional dendrimeric linker was developed that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars in just one step. The method exploits different click reactivities of the linker azides in a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with alkynes. The new method is fast, highly selective and allows the modification of the oligonucleotide with multiple sugars at any given position.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in the form of siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides or mRNA are currently explored as new promising modalities in the pharmaceutical industry. Particularly, the success of mRNA&#8208;vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, along with the successful development of the first sugar&#8208;modified siRNA therapeutics has inspired the field. The development of nucleic acid therapeutics requires efficient chemistry to link oligonucleotides to chemical structures that can improve stability, boost cellular uptake, or enable specific targeting. For the siRNA therapeutics currently in use, modification of the 3&#8242;&#8208;end of the oligonucleotides with triple&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)3 was shown to be of significance. This modification is currently achieved through cumbersome multistep synthesis and subsequent loading onto the solid support material. Herein, we report the development of a bifunctional click&#8208;reactive linker that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars, regardless of the position within the oligonucleotide, with remarkable efficiency and in a one&#8208;pot reaction.

         <title>Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a unified mechanism for photoswitching in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging by analyzing various photoswitching reagents. We found that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process. Based on this systematic investigation, sodium azide is suggested as a new photoswitching reagent.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized optical microscopy by exceeding the diffraction limit and revealing previously unattainable nanoscale details of cellular structures and molecular dynamics. This super&#8208;resolution imaging capability relies on fluorophore photoswitching, which is crucial for optimizing the imaging conditions and accurately determining the fluorophore positions. To understand the general on and off photoswitching mechanisms of single dye molecules, various photoswitching reagents were evaluated. Systematic measurement of the single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level fluorescence on and off rates (kon and koff) in the presence of various photoswitching reagents and theoretical calculation of the structure of the photoswitching reagent&#8208;fluorophore pair indicated that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, which is related to the power of the illuminating laser and bond dissociation energy of this pair. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the molecular photoswitching mechanism in SMLM imaging and provides a basis for designing improved photoswitching reagents with potential applications extending to materials science and chemistry.

         <title>PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy&#8208;Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi&#8208;Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of polyborylated cyclobutanes by photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is reported. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to the polyborylated alkenes and operates with a wide array of polyborylated alkenes, and olefins, allowing for the creation of polyborylated&#8208;biradical intermediates. A side&#8208;product resulting from a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) via a photo&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction was also obtained.







Abstract
While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy&#8208;transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly&#8208;borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy&#8208;transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of poly&#8208;borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly&#8208;borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1&#8208;di&#8208;, 1,1,2&#8208;tri&#8208;, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Mechanistic deuterium&#8208;labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;&#8208;lactones.

         <title>Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots originating from cellulose confined in a silica matrix result in long afterglow emission indicating formation of triplet states. Their use as sensitizer in radical photopolymerization results either in free radical polymerization or controlled radical polymerization based on a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol depending on the composition. Metal&#8208;free setup indicated less uniformity while a trace of CuBr2/TPMA resulted in dispersity approaching to unity depending on concentration.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose carbon dots (CMCCDs), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in CMCCDs@SiO2. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra gave information on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo&#8208;ATRP initiator, ethyl &#945;&#8208;bromophenylacetate (EBPA), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Both free radical and controlled radical polymerization based on photo&#8208;ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either MMA or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9&#8197;ppm Cu2+ resulted in Mw/Mn of 1.4 while an increase to 72&#8197;ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is Mw/Mn=1.03. Complementary experiments with kerria laca carbon dots confined materials, namely KCDs@SiO2, provided similar results.

     alt="Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dots originating from cellulose confined in a silica matrix result in long afterglow emission indicating formation of triplet states. Their use as sensitizer in radical photopolymerization results either in free radical polymerization or controlled radical polymerization based on a photo-ATRP protocol depending on the composition. Metal-free setup indicated less uniformity while a trace of CuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;b&gt;TPMA&lt;/b&gt; resulted in dispersity approaching to unity depending on concentration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose carbon dots (&lt;b&gt;CMCCD&lt;/b&gt;s), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in &lt;b&gt;CMCCD&lt;/b&gt;s@&lt;b&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature-dependent emission spectra gave information on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo-ATRP initiator, ethyl &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#945;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-bromophenylacetate (&lt;b&gt;EBPA&lt;/b&gt;), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (&lt;b&gt;PET&lt;/b&gt;). Both free radical and controlled radical polymerization based on photo-ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal-free photo-ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either &lt;b&gt;MMA&lt;/b&gt; or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9&#8197;ppm Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.4 while an increase to 72&#8197;ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=1.03. Complementary experiments with &lt;i&gt;kerria laca&lt;/i&gt; carbon dots confined materials, namely &lt;b&gt;KCD&lt;/b&gt;s@&lt;b&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, provided similar results. Deposition of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (9&#8197;ppm) on the photocatalyst surface explains better uniformity of the polymers formed in the ATRP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes, focusing on engineering reaction environments. It discusses strategies for electrocatalyst design, electrode modification, and electrolyte optimization to enhance CO2RR while suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization&#8208;responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation&#8208;responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Mitigating Sodium Ordering for Enhanced Solid Solution Behavior in Layered NaNiO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective reduction of multiple phase transformations in NaNiO2 has been achieved through divalent Mg2+ doping, which deshields the electron density from Na+ ions. This outcome can be attributed to the more ionic nature of Mg&#8722;O bond, creating free space for the mobility of Na+ ions and mitigating the Na+ion ordering.







Abstract
The O&#8208;type layered nickel oxides suffer from undesired cooperative Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion stemming from Ni3+ ions and undergo multiple biphasic structural transformations during the insertion/extraction of large Na+ ions, posing a significant challenge to stabilize the structural integrity. We present here a systematic investigation of the impact of substituting 5&#8201;% divalent (Mg2+) or trivalent (Al3+ or Co3+) ions for Ni3+ to alleviate Na+ion ordering and perturb the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect to enhance structural stability. We gauge a fundamental understanding of the Mg&#8722;O and Na&#8722;O or Mg&#8722;O&#8722;Na bonding interactions, noting that the ionicity of the Mg&#8722;O bond deshields the electronic cloud of oxygen from Na+ ions. Furthermore, calculations of the Van Vleck distortion modes reveal a relaxation of NiO6 octahedra from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and a reduced electron density at the interlayer with Mg2+ substitution. Long&#8208;range (operando
X&#8208;ray diffraction) and short&#8208;range (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) structural analyses provide insights into reduced ordering, allowing a stable continuous solid solution. Overall, Mg&#8208;substitution results in a high&#8208;capacity retention of ~96&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;cycles, showcasing the potential of this strategy for overcoming the structural instabilities and enhancing the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Art: Visualizing the Near&#8208;Symmetry of Molecules in Piet Mondrian's De Stijl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can we use asymmetric art to show symmetry? A new plot style, the Mondrian graph, is proposed as a method of displaying the concerted distortions of molecules, highlighting symmetry and the contribution of normal modes to solid&#8208;state conformation. The method of display borrows its artistic stylings from the works of Piet Mondrian&#8212;and speaks to how artistic and scientific conceptions of symmetry can be brought together.







Abstract
Symmetry and shape are essential aspects of molecular structure and how we interpret molecules and their properties. We, as chemists, are comfortable with pictorial representations of structure, in which some nuance is lost&#8212;investigating molecular shape numerically by looking at how closely it fits a reference, such as a plane, or a set of vectors or coordinates, is informative, though far from engaging. Often relationships between chemical structure and derived values are obscured. Taking our inspiration from Piet Mondrian's Compositions, we have depicted the symmetry information encoded within 3D data as blocks of color, to show clearly how chemical arguments and resultant molecular distortion may contribute to symmetry. Great art gives us a new perspective on the world; as a pastiche, this art may allow us to look at familiar molecules, such as porphyrins, in a new light, understanding how their shape and properties are intertwined.

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultrahigh Porosity for High&#8208;temperature and High&#8208;humidity Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on phosphomolybdate is synthesized. The micropore of material is readily opened, which is suitable for adsorption of small molecules. The material shows high separation performance of alkyne and alkene particularly under high temperature and humidity conditions.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is a newly synthesized all&#8208;inorganic zeolitic material and has been used for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Herein, a new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide was synthesized and characterized. The porous framework was established through the assembly of [P2Mo13O50] clusters with PO4 linkers. Guest molecules occupied the framework, which could be removed through heat treatment, thereby opening the micropores. The pore characteristics were controlled by the cations within the micropore, enabling the adjustment of the interactions with alkynes and alkenes. This resulted in good separation performance of ethylene/acetylene and propylene/propyne even under high temperature and humidity conditions. The high stability of the material enabled the efficient recovery and reuse without discernible loss in the separation performance. Due to the relatively weak interaction between the adsorbed alkyne and the framework, the adsorbent facilitated the recovery of a highly pure alkyne. This feature enhances the practical applicability of the material in various industrial processes.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerobic oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable formyl surrogate derived from biobased feedstocks such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde is achieved over C3N4&#8208;supported single CuN4 sites with 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms and much higher turnover frequency (TOF) than noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cuphen/C3N4 catalysts. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#8901;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#8901;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8722;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#8901;NR1R2 and &#8901;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our catalyst has much higher activity (TOF) than those based on noble metals.

         <title>Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;&#8208;OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic trialkylammonium arylating agents are shown to react efficiently with RNA in water, placing aryl ethers at 2&#8242;&#8208;O positions in the biopolymer. The reagents, which are stable for weeks in water but react with RNA in minutes to hours, can be used to modify and label RNA, and to probe its structure.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron&#8208;deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA in water via SNAr chemistry. In particular, trialkyl&#8208;ammonium (TAA)&#8208;activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8211;3&#8197;h. Remarkably, a TAA triazine previously used only for reaction with carboxylic acids, shows unprecedented selectivity for RNA over water, reacting rapidly with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups while exhibiting a half&#8208;life in water of &gt;10&#8197;days. We further show that a triazine aryl species can be used as a probe at trace&#8208;level yields to map RNA structure in vitro. Finally, we prepare a number of functionalized trialkylammonium triazine reagents and show that they can be used to covalently label RNA efficiently for use in vitro and in living cells. This direct arylation chemistry offers a simple and distinct structural scaffold for post&#8208;synthetic RNA modification, with potential utility in multiple applications in transcriptome research.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Polymerization at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylative polymerization. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers with high molecular weights. Notably, the mild reaction conditions are beneficial in terms of chemoselectivity. Our strategy thus opens a new avenue for sustainable and highly selective polymerizations.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization (CHAP) is an attractive tool for constructing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers in a sustainable manner. However, the existing methods primarily rely on palladium catalysis, which usually entails harsh reaction conditions and branching/cross&#8208;linking. Here we report the first example of an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization induced by visible light irradiation. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.

         <title>Unveiling the Pivotal Role of dx2&#8722;y2 Electronic States in Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dx2&#8722;y2 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the Ni(OH)2&#8208;based methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. The closer of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. This work provides a new design paradigm for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency Ni(OH)2&#8208;based catalysts for MOR.







Abstract
The anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enables the sustainable production of the high&#8208;valued formate. Nickel&#8208;based hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as MOR electrocatalyst has attracted enormous attention. However, the key factor determining the intrinsic catalytic activity remains unknown, which significantly hinders the further development of Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst. Here, we found that the 
 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the whole MOR process. The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of 
 orbital. The closer of 
 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of 
 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. Our work for the first time clarifies the intrinsic relationship between 
 electronic state and the MOR activities, which adds a new layer of understanding to the methanol electrooxidation research scene.

         <title>3D Printing of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems with Linear and Bottlebrush Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyelectrolyte complex, comprising anionic bottlebrush polymer and cationic linear polymer, exhibits a broader phase separation diagram and higher salt resistance capacity and vary spherical&#8208;like to core&#8211;shell&#8208;like conformation. Utilizing this system creates a tubular&#8208;like flow structure at the interface of two aqueous liquids, enhancing the structural stability, offering a more efficient and easy method for particle transport.







Abstract
We formed core&#8211;shell&#8208;like polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from an anionic bottlebrush polymer with poly (acrylic acid) side chains with a cationic linear poly (allylamine hydrochloride). By varying the pH, the number of side chains of the polyanionic BB polymers (Nbb), the charge density of the polyelectrolytes, and the salt concentration, the phase separation behavior and salt resistance of the complexes could be tuned by the conformation of the BBs. By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all&#8208;liquid 3D printing, flow&#8208;through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow&#8208;through delivery systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl electrophile has been developed to access diversified enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tertiary amino acid with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this protocol includes the efficient assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.

         <title>Taylor Dispersion&#8208;Induced Phase Separation for the Efficient Characterisation of Protein Condensate Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein phase separation (PPS) is important in functional and disease biology but is challenging to study. We present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS) to study PPS in a reaction&#8208;diffusion system inside a microfluidic capillary. The resulting data is highly information&#8208;rich and allows for thermodynamic analysis but also efficient screening campaigns of phase separation&#8208;modulating compounds using only nanoliters of sample per data point.







Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion&#8208;induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nanoliters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.

TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS-modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Consolidation of the Oxidant&#8208;Free Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis Enabled by the Hemilabile Ligand Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview we survey the novel approaches for oxidant&#8208;free Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis focusing on the hemilabile ligand strategy, where (P^N) MeDalphos hemilabile ligand stands as the most successful example. Moreover, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom couplings and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands and novel (C^N) hemilabile ligands are also reviewed.







Abstract
In this minireview we survey the challenges and strategies in gold redox catalysis. Gold's reluctance to oxidative addition reactions due to its high redox potential limits its applicability. Initial attempts to overcome this problem focused on the use of sacrificial external oxidants in stoichiometric amounts to bring Au(I) compounds to Au(III) reactive species. Recently, innovative approaches focused on employing hemilabile ligands, which are capable of coordinating to Au(I) and stabilizing square&#8208;planar Au(III) intermediates, thus facilitating oxidative addition steps and enabling oxidant&#8208;free catalysis. Notable examples include the use of the (P^N) bidendate MeDalphos ligand to achieve various cross&#8208;coupling reactions via oxidative addition Au(I)/Au(III). Importantly, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, such as oxy&#8208; and aminoarylation of alkenols and alkenamines using organohalides, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent advancements in enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands are also surveyed. Strikingly, versatile bidentate (C^N) hemilabile ligands as competitors of MeDalphos have appeared recently, by designing scaffolds where phosphine groups are substituted by N&#8208;heterocyclic or mesoionic carbenes. Overall, these approaches highlight the evolving landscape of gold redox catalysis and its tremendous potential in a broad scope of transformations.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Ethers to Mitigate Electrode Surface Reactivity in High&#8208;Voltage NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte to prolong the lifespan of high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich ternary LMBs. The electrolyte simultaneously solves the challenges of both the high&#8208;voltage cathode and Li metal anode by mitigating the electrode surface reactivity. The problems of NiO rock&#8208;salt transition, intragranular crack/microstructural defect formation, gas releases, and over&#8208;growth SEI have been alleviated.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel (Ni)&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes exhibit twice the energy density of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their lifespan is limited by severe side reactions caused by high electrode reactivity. Fluorinated solvent&#8208;based electrolytes can address this challenge, but they pose environmental and biological hazards. This work reports on the molecular engineering of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers to mitigate electrode surface reactivity in high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich LMBs. By merely extending the alkyl chains of traditional ethers, we effectively reduce the catalytic reactivity of the cathode towards the electrolyte at high voltages, which suppresses the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte, microstructural defects and rock&#8208;salt phase formation in the cathode, and gas release issues. The high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich NCM811&#8208;Li battery delivers capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%, even superior to that in carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, this strategy facilitates passivation of the Li anode by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, boosting the Li reversibility to 99.11&#8201;% with a cycling life of 350&#8197;cycles, which outperforms conventional F&#8208;free ether electrolytes. Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100&#8201;% and 500&#8201;% compared to those in conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Engineering of Halide Methyltransferase BxHMT through Dynamic Cross&#8208;Correlation Network Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine assumes a crucial role in biocatalytic alkylation. To improve the catalytic ability of BxHMT towards methyl toluene sulfonate, a strategy named dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) was proposed for the identification of potential mutation sites, both distal and proximal. Experimental results proved the efficiency of the approach, which is expected to be a useful tool for other enzyme engineering studies.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). As compared with MeI, the cost&#8208;effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessed directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. In this study, we developed a dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from Paraburkholderia xenovorans. Finally, the optimal mutant, M4 (V55T/C125S/L127T/L129P), exhibited remarkable improvement, with a specific activity of 4.08&#8197;U/mg towards MeOTs, representing an 82&#8208;fold increase as compared to the wild&#8208;type (WT) enzyme. Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work not only contributes a promising biocatalyst for the regeneration of SAM, but also offers a strategy for efficient enzyme engineering.

         <title>Detergent Chemistry Modulates the Transgression of Planetary Boundaries including Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's detergent o'clock and the role of detergent chemistry in transgressing Earth's resources is reviewed to support future research that secures safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival.







Abstract
Detergent chemistry enables applications in the world today while harming safe operating spaces that humanity needs for survival. Aim of this review is to support a holistic thought process in the design of detergent chemistry. We harness the planetary boundary concept as a framework for literature survey to identify progresses and knowledge gaps in context with detergent chemistry and five planetary boundaries that are currently transgressed, i.e., climate, freshwater, land system, novel entities, biosphere integrity. Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate&#8208;friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.

         <title>Alveoli&#8208;Inspired Carbon Cathodes with Interconnected Porous Structure and Asymmetric Coordinated Vanadium Sites for Superior Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alveoli&#8208;inspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites has been proposed for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The asymmetric electronic distribution and large atom radius of S resulted in the sloping adsorption for polysulfide and low thermodynamic energy barriers, which resulted in enhanced sulfur adsorption&#8208;catalytic conversion and stable long&#8208;cycle performance for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating sulfur conversion catalysis to alleviate the shuttle effect has become a novel paradigm for effective Li&#8722;S batteries. Although nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom (M&#8722;N4) catalysts have been investigated, further optimizing its utilization rate and catalytic activities is urgently needed for practical applications. Inspired by the natural alveoli tissue with interconnected structure and well&#8208;distributed enzyme catalytic sites on the wall for the simultaneously fast diffusion and in situ catalytic conversion of substrates, here, we proposed the controllable synthesis of bioinspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The enzyme&#8208;mimetic V&#8722;S1N3 shows asymmetric electronic distribution and high tunability, therefore enhancing in situ polysulfide conversion activities. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high charge asymmetry degree and large atom radius of S in V&#8722;S1N3 result in sloping adsorption for polysulfide, thereby exhibiting low thermodynamic energy barriers and long&#8208;range stability (0.076&#8201;% decay over 600&#8197;cycles).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alveoli-inspired carbon cathode&lt;/b&gt; with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites has been proposed for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The asymmetric electronic distribution and large atom radius of S resulted in the sloping adsorption for polysulfide and low thermodynamic energy barriers, which resulted in enhanced sulfur adsorption-catalytic conversion and stable long-cycle performance for high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries.

         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic kinetic resolution strategy was developed for the access of chiral Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes. By employing Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation, both dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;based organosilanes and monohydrosilane containing ortho&#8208;vinyl group could be prepared with high efficiency and good to excellent selectivity factors in one single operation.







Abstract
The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, a low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism.

         <title>Fabrication of Large&#8208;Area Multi&#8208;Stimulus Responsive Thin Films via Interfacially Confined Irreversible Katritzky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films were fabricated through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions, vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination.







Abstract
Fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films through irreversible reactions remains a formidable task. This study reports a breakthrough strategy for in situ synthesis of large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The as resulted films are featured with adjustable thickness of 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and an area up to 50&#8197;cm2. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions (a response time of ca 0.1&#8197;s), vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. It was revealed that the reason behind the observable motions is proton transfer from the imine groups to the carbonyl structures within the film induced by photo&#8208; and/or dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;stimulus. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination. This study provides a new strategy for fabricating smart thin films via interfacially confined irreversible Katritzky reaction.

         <title>Stabilization of Pd0 by Cu Alloying: Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Pd3Cu Electrocatalyst for Anodic Methanol Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the anodic electrocarbonylation of methanol to produce DMC, our theoretical studies suggest Cu&#8722;Pd alloy not only stabilizes Pd0, the true active site, but also reduces the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. The theoretically predicted Pd3Cu, synthesized by a two&#8208;step thermal shock method, achieves FEDMC of 93&#8201;%@1.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, far surpassing existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH3OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self&#8208;oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd0 and Pd4+ surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation. Further theoretical modeling indicates that doping Pd with Cu not only stabilizes low&#8208;valence Pd in oxidative environments but also lowers the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. Guided by this insight, we developed a facile two&#8208;step thermal shock method to prepare PdCu alloy electrocatalysts for DMC. Remarkably, the predicted Pd3Cu demonstrated the highest DMC selectivity among existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts, reaching a peaked DMC selectivity of 93&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. (Quasi) in situ spectra investigations further confirmed the predicted dual role of Cu dopant in promoting Pd&#8208;catalyzed DMC formation.
