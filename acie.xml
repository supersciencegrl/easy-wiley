         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diaseteroselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Piperidines Enabled by Boronyl Radical&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidines are widely present in small molecule drugs and natural products. Despite many methods have been developed for their synthesis, new approaches to polysubstituted piperidines are highly desirable. This work presents a radical (4+2) cycloaddition reaction for synthesis of piperidines featuring dense substituents at 3,4,5&#8208;positions that are not readily accessible by known methods. Using commercially available diboron(4) compounds and 4&#8208;phenylpyridine as the catalyst precursors, the boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition between 3&#8208;aroyl azetidines and various alkenes, including previously unreactive 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes, has delivered the polysubstituted piperidines in generally high yield and diastereoselectivity. The reaction also features high modularity, atom economy, broad substrate scope, metal&#8208;free conditions, simple catalysts and operation. The utilization of the products has been demonstrated by selective transformations. A plausible mechanism, with the ring&#8208;opening of azetidine as the rate&#8208;limiting step, has been proposed based on the experimental and computational results.</dc:description>

         <title>Value&#8208;added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208; hexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrog&#8208; enolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78% and 89% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and material science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation on both ends of S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge, due to the reversible covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling was successfully achieved with preferential activation of S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6 kcal/mol) and controllable activation of S&#8722;O bond (54.8 kcal/mol) superior to S&#8722;S bond (62.0 kcal/mol), enabled untrammeled installation on the bilateral sides of S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and protein (bovine serum albumin) cross&#8208;linkage successively.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt; 10&#8722;10 Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.</dc:description>

Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed-valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin-type or Dawson-type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Reprograms Cellular Metabolism to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy and Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxia and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8209;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90% with a 40% cure rate, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98% tumor inhibition and an 80% cure rate.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Site&#8208;Isolated Mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst on a Metal&#8208;Organic Layer for Highly Efficient Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine&#8208;ligated transition metal complexes play a pivotal role in modern catalysis, but our understanding of the impact of ligand counts on the catalysis performance of the metal center is limited. Here we report the synthesis of a low&#8208;coordinate mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh catalyst on a metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL), P&#8208;MOL&#9679;Rh, and its applications in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes as well as aryl nitriles with turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 390000. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations revealed the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh sites on the MOL to provide superior catalytic activity over homogeneous Rh catalysts. The MOL also prevents catalyst deactivation to enable recycle and reuse of P&#8208;MOL&#9679;Rh in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal High&#8208;Order Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of various cycloaddition / annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges during all time in the development of the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes chemistry. In this work, a new missing class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was study in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic complexes or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates from starting D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, when other Lewis acids are ineffective and non&#8208;selective. New important examples of formal [6+2]&#8208;, [6+3]&#8208;, [6+4]&#8208;, [6+1]&#8208;, and [4+2]&#8208; cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself also can successfully act as a hydride anion donor which allows ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;based carbocycles has been developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt; 150 examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Cage Membranes Constructed Using Fortified Intermolecular Interactions for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various types of materials with intrinsic porosity, porous organic cages (POCs) are distinctive as discrete molecules that possess intrinsic cavities and extrinsic channels capable of facilitating molecular sieving. However, the fabrication of POC membranes remains highly challenging due to the weak noncovalent intermolecular interactions and most reported POCs are powders. In this study, we constructed crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage membranes by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To elucidate the driving forces behind, a series of terephthaldehyde building blocks containing different substitutions were reacted with flexible triamine under different conditions via interfacial polymerization (IP). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can significantly boost the intermolecular interactions. The resulting membranes exhibited fast solvent permeance and high rejection of dyes not only in water, but also in organic solvents. In addition, the membrane demonstrated excellent performance in precise molecular sieving in organic solvents. This work opens an avenue to designing and fabricating free&#8208;standing membranes composed of porous organic materials for efficient molecular sieving.</dc:description>

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non&#8208;renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness. However, the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact hinder SSLMBs&#8217; practical application. In this paper, the flexible SPE of in situ polymerized PAAA opens and stabilizes the Li+ &#8242;highway&#8242; inside the SPE, enhancing Li+ transport, and the oxygen vacancies of SiO2 synergize with the substrate to bind the TFSI&#8722;, forming and transporting freer Li+, thus achieving high performance of SSLMBs at room temperature. This study provides ideas for the practical application of SSLMBs.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8722; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid-state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid-solid interface contact of solid-state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature (RT), and a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport number (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li+&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; created an excellent environment for TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; immobilization. Free Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while maintaining excellent cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hybrid Orbitrap&#8208;Nanoelectromechanical Systems Approach for the Analysis of Individual, Intact Proteins in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectromechanical systems&#8208;based mass spectrometry (NEMS&#8208;MS) determines the mass of individual particles by monitoring resonance frequency changes in tiny mechanical devices. Incorporating NEMS into an Orbitrap instrument enhances the dynamic range and enables deep proteomic analysis. This work measures E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules, showing good agreement with the known mass.







Abstract
Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)&#8208;based mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technique that enables determination of the mass of individual adsorbed particles by driving nanomechanical devices at resonance and monitoring the real&#8208;time changes in their resonance frequencies induced by each single molecule adsorption event. We incorporate NEMS into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and report our progress towards leveraging the single&#8208;molecule capabilities of the NEMS to enhance the dynamic range of conventional MS instrumentation and to offer new capabilities for performing deep proteomic analysis of clinically relevant samples. We use the hybrid instrument to deliver E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules (801&#8197;kDa) to the NEMS devices in their native, intact state. Custom ion optics are used to focus the beam down to 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter with a maximum flux of 25&#8197;molecules/second. The mass spectrum obtained with NEMS&#8208;MS shows good agreement with the known mass of GroEL.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Delivery of Carbon Disulfide in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system has been developed for cell platform applications, and it is found that the hepatoxicity caused by CS2 is related to oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death.







Abstract
Carbon disulfide (CS2) is an environmental contaminant, which is deadly hazardous to the workers under chronic or acute exposure. However, the toxicity mechanisms of CS2 are still unclear due to the scarcity of biocompatible donors, which can release CS2 in cells. Here we developed the first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system based on the &#8220;click&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; reactions between mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;5&#8208;thiolates (TATs) and strained cyclooctyne exo&#8208;BCN&#8208;OH. We successfully realized intracellular CS2 release and investigated the causes of CS2&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death. It is found that CS2 can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death. These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS2 in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS2 delivery system.

         <title>Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO by Ligand Engineering of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active electrocatalyst for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion was successfully prepared by the ligand engineering of Au25 nanoclusters with a cation&#8208;relaying ligand. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized nanoclusters was significantly boosted when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of the ligand, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT=1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+&lt;Na+&lt;K+&lt;Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted carbene organocatalytic approach to afford a wide range of chiral N(V)&#8208;stereogenic N&#8208;oxide products is disclosed by formal desymmetrization of remote diols.







Abstract
The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.

Cu+/Cu2+ dual&#8208;valence state and electron enrichment of Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V favorable to *CO adsorption and then C&#8722;C coupling, enabling CO2 photoreduction to ethanol.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been shown to selectively catalyze CO2 photoreduction to C2+ solar fuels. However, they still suffer from poor activity and low selectivity. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol and delivers 69.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8&#8201;% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with DFT calculations, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration, in which the Cu sites are electron enriched and enhance electron delocalization. Importantly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in both Cu+ and Cu2+ valence states, although predominantly as Cu+. The Cu+ sites support the CO2 activation, while the co&#8208;existence of Cu+/Cu2+ sites are highly conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8722;C coupling. Furthermore, the hollow microstructure of the catalyst also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for the solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also elucidates the C&#8208;C coupling reaction path via *CO&#8208;*CO to *COCOH and rate&#8208;determining step, and reveals the valence state change of partial Cu species from Cu+ to Cu2+ in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during CO2 photoreduction reaction.

         <title>Coupling CO2 Reduction and Acetyl&#8208;CoA Formation: The Role of a CO Capturing Tunnel in Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase (CODH)/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (ACS) complex couples catalysis at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the generated CO. Hydrophobic sites with affinity for CO within the tunnel act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Our tunnel remodeling suggests that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.







Abstract
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. In this study, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8210;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8210;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8210;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals from Organoboron Reagents Enabled by Pulsed Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed electrosynthesis efficiently converts aromatic organoboron reagents to aryl radicals. Mechanistic studies reveal that pulsed electrosynthesis overcomes challenges like radical grafting/passivation, homocoupling, overoxidation, and decomposition. This electro&#8208;oxidative method enables straightforward functionalization of aromatic organoboron reagents to form aryl C&#8722;P, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Aryl radicals play a pivotal role as reactive intermediates in chemical synthesis, commonly arising from aryl halides and aryl diazo compounds. Expanding the repertoire of sources for aryl radical generation to include abundant and stable organoboron reagents would significantly advance radical chemistry and broaden their reactivity profile. While traditional approaches utilize stoichiometric oxidants or photocatalysis to generate aryl radicals from these reagents, electrochemical conditions have been largely underexplored. Through rigorous mechanistic investigations, we identified fundamental challenges hindering aryl radical generation. In addition to the high oxidation potentials of aromatic organoboron compounds, electrode passivation through radical grafting, homocoupling of aryl radicals, and decomposition issues were identified. We demonstrate that pulsed electrosynthesis enables selective and efficient aryl radical generation by mitigating the fundamental challenges. Our discoveries facilitated the development of the first electrochemical conversion of aryl potassium trifluoroborate salts into aryl C&#8722;P bonds. This sustainable and straightforward oxidative electrochemical approach exhibited a broad substrate scope, accommodating various heterocycles and aryl chlorides, typical substrates in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to form aryl C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds, showcasing its versatility and potential in bond formation processes.

         <title>Multi&#8208;component Copolymerized Donors enable Frozen Nano&#8208;morphology and Superior Ductility for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of efficient multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) P10.8/P20.2, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl, P10.7/P20.3&#8208;TCl, and P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl were synthesized, and excellent efficiencies in both rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs along with fracture strain in pristine film (16.59&#8201;%) for P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl were achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) have gained significant interest and have been rapidly developed in flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) in recent years. However, ensuring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;OSCs while retaining ideal mechanical properties remains an enormous challenge. The fracture strain (FS) value of typical high&#8208;efficiency blend films is generally less than 8&#8201;%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end&#8208;capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs, along with excellent FS values (16.59&#8201;%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding FS values of 25.18&#8201;% and 12.3&#8201;% were achieved by P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl &#8208;based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end&#8208;capped MCD&#8208;based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.

The fracture strain (&lt;i&gt;FS&lt;/i&gt;) value of typical high-efficiency blend films is generally less than 8&#8201;%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end-capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;/P2&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;-TCl&lt;/b&gt; exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs, along with excellent &lt;i&gt;FS&lt;/i&gt; values (16.59&#8201;%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding &lt;i&gt;FS&lt;/i&gt; values of 25.18&#8201;% and 12.3&#8201;% were achieved by &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;/P2&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-TCl&lt;/b&gt; -based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end-capped MCD-based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high-efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Trigger Rapid Charge Transport Channels at the Engineered Interface of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Boosting Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst with advanced performance is developed. Rapid charge transport ways triggered by Ovs at the heterointerface are unveiled by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS). The mechanism of Ovs on this S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is revealed by comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) have been intensively studied in single semiconductor photocatalysts, exploration of intrinsic mechanisms and in&#8208;depth understanding of Ovs in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are still limited. Herein, a novel S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst made from WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 with Ovs at the heterointerface is rationally designed. The microscopic environment and local electronic structure of the S&#8208;scheme heterointerface are well optimized by Ovs. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveals that Ovs trigger additional charge movement routes and therefore increase charge separation efficiency. In addition, Ovs have a synergistic effect on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts. As a result, the optimal photocatalytic performance is significantly improved, surpassing that of single component WO3&#8208;Ov and In2S3 (by 35.5 and 3.9&#8197;times, respectively), as well as WO3/In2S3 heterojunction. This work provides new insight into regulating the photogenerated carrier dynamics at the heterointerface and also helps design highly efficient S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts.

         <title>Allyl&#8208;Allyl Coupling Promoted by Catalyst Systems with two Palladium Atoms &#8211; A Plethora of Potentially Pericyclic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plethora of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in a palladium promoted allyl coupling reaction was explored with quantum chemical computations, with results implying that one should perhaps consider such processes regularly, but do so with caution. The results of these calculations lead to a revision of the mechanism for a recently reported allyl coupling reaction that makes use of an unusual outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination.







Abstract
Recently, Huang and co&#8208;workers reported a catalytic reaction that utilizes H2 as the sole reductant for a C&#8722;C coupling of allyl groups with yields up to 96&#8201;%. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to identify several key features of this reaction that provide clarity on how it proceeds. We propose the involvement of a Pd&#8722;Pd bound dimer precatalyst, demonstrate the importance of ligand &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and counterions, and identify a new, energetically viable, mechanism involving two dimerized, outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination transition structures that determine both the rate and selectivity. Although we rule out the previously proposed transmetalation step on energetic grounds, we show it to have an unusual aromatic transition structure in which two Pd atoms support rearranging electrons. The prevalence of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in this system suggests that one should consider such processes regularly, but the results of our calculations also indicate that one should do so with caution.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;Nonadjacent Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Enabled by Pd/Cu&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Heck Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters enabled by a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric Heck cascade reaction has been developed. An array of highly functionalized chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids, were smoothly prepared. Notably, all four stereoisomers of the desired products were obtained through orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts.







Abstract
The construction of chiral motifs containing nonadjacent stereocenters in an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner has long been a challenging task in synthetic chemistry, especially with respect to their stereodivergent synthesis. Herein, we describe a protocol that enables the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters through a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed Heck cascade reaction. Notably, a C=C bond relay strategy involving the shift of the &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate was successfully applied in the asymmetric construction of 1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. The current method allows for the efficient preparation of chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, with good functional group tolerance. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of products bearing 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters could be readily accessed by a simple combination of two chiral metal catalysts with different enantiomers.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency to 12.0&#8201;% of an Ultraviolet OLED by Engineering the Horizontal Dipole Orientation of a Hot Exciton Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D triad UV emitter, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV emission, good hot exciton conversion capability and large horizontal dipole ratio, the CDFDB&#8208;based UV OLED can emit highly efficient near UV EL at 398&#8197;nm (CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040) with a maximum EQE of 12.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, much research effort has been devoted to improving the exciton utilization efficiency and narrowing the emission spectra of ultraviolet (UV) fluorophores for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications, while almost no attention has been paid to optimizing their light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we developed a linear donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) triad, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV photoluminescence (PL) (&#955;PL: 397&#8197;nm; FWHM: 48&#8197;nm), moderate PL quantum yield (&#981;PL: 72&#8201;%, Tol), good triplet hot exciton (HE) conversion capability, and large horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//: 92&#8201;%), the OLEDs based on CDFDB not only can emit UV electroluminescence with relatively good color purity (&#955;EL: 398&#8197;nm; CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040), but also show a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 12.0&#8201;%. This study highlights the important role of horizontal dipole orientation engineering in the molecular design of HE UV&#8208;OLED fluorophores.

         <title>Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Thermoresponsive hydrogels were fabricated from helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers, which showed stabilized helicities originated from the copolymer precursors, and memorized the thermally&#8208;induced chiralities. These hydrogels possessed excellent mechanical properties, and exhibited unprecedent compressibility with extraordinary fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Fabrication of chiral hydrogels from thermoresponsive helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers (PPAs) carrying three&#8208;fold dendritic oligoethylene glycols (OEGs) is reported. Three different temperatures, i.e. below or above cloud point temperatures (Tcps) of the copolymers, and under freezing condition, were utilized, affording thermoresponsive hydrogels with different morphologies and mechanical properties. At room temperature, transparent hydrogels were obtained through crosslinking among different copolymer chains. Differently, opaque hydrogels with much improved mechanical properties were formed at elevated temperatures through crosslinking from the thermally dehydrated and collapsed copolymer aggregates, leading to heterogeneity for the hydrogels with highly porous morphology. While crosslinking at freezing temperature synergistically through ice templating, these amphiphilic dendronized copolymers formed hydrogels with highly porous lamellar structures, which exhibited remarkable compressible properties as human articular cartilage with excellent fatigue resistance. Amphiphilicity of the dendronized copolymers played a pivotal role in modulating the network formation during the gelation, as well as morphology and mechanical performance of the resulting hydrogels. Through crosslinking, these dendronized copolymers featured with typical dynamic helical conformations were transformed into hydrogels with unprecedently stabilized helicities due to the restrained chain mobilities in the three&#8208;dimensional networks.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV&#8208;Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Cs+ Ions on Carbon Vacancies for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO at High Current Densities in Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte cations have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the rate and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet their implementation in electrolyte&#8208;free membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer presents significant challenges. Herein, an anchored cation strategy that immobilizes Cs+ on carbon vacancies was designed and innovatively implemented in MEA electrolyzer, enabling highly efficient CO2 electroreduction over commercial silver catalyst. Our approach achieves a CO partial current density of approximately 500 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA electrolyzer, three&#8208;fold enhancement compared to pure Ag. In&#8208;situ Raman and theoretical analyses, combined with machine learning potentials, reveal anchored Cs induces an electric field that significantly promotes the adsorption of *CO2&#8722; intermediates through performing muti&#8208;point energy calculations on each structure. Furthermore, reduced adsorption of *OH intermediates effectively hampers competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as clarified by disk electrode experiments and density functional theory studies. Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation&#8208;promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Low Temperature Superionic Conductivity by Suppression of Li Site Ordering in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ge4+ substitution into the recently discovered superionic conductor Li7Si2S7I is demonstrated by synthesis of Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I, where x &#8804; 1.2. The anion packing and tetrahedral silicon location of Li7Si2S7I are retained upon substitution. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that substitution of larger Ge4+ for Si4+ expands the unit cell volume and further increases Li+ site disorder, such that Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I has one Li+ site more (sixteen in total) than Li7Si2S7I. The ionic conductivity of Li7Si0.8Ge1.2S7I (x = 1.2) at 303 K is 1.02(3) &#215; 10&#8211;2 S cm&#8211;1 with low activation energies for Li+ transport demonstrated over a wide temperature range by AC impedance and 7Li NMR spectroscopy. All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30 K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200 K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li ion conducting materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abiotic stress tends to induce oxidative damage to enzymes and organelles that in turns hampers the phosphorylation process and decreases the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#160;productivity. Artificial assemblies can alleviate abiotic stress and simultaneously provide nutrients to diminish the oxidative damage. Here, we have integrated natural acid phosphatase (ACP)&#160;and ATP synthase with plasmonic Au clusters in a biomimetic microreactor. ACP&#160;immobilized on the Au clusters is harnessed to generate proton influx to drive ATP synthase and concurrently supply phosphate to improve phosphorus availability to combat phosphorus&#8208;deficiency stress. In tandem with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and the photothermal functionality of Au clusters, such an assembled microreactor exhibits an improved abiotic stress tolerance and achieves plasmon&#8208;accelerated ATP synthesis. This innovative approach offers an effective route to enhance the stress resistance of ATP synthase&#8208;based energy&#8208;generating systems, opening an exciting potential of these systems for biomimicking applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Cooperative Multivalency in Thioguanine for SERS Differentiation of Polyfunctional Analytes Differing by Single Functional Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule receptors are increasingly employed to probe various functional groups for (bio)chemical analysis. However, differentiation of polyfunctional analogs sharing multiple functional groups remains challenging for conventional mono&#8208; and bidentate receptors because their insufficient number of binding sites limits interactions with the least reactive yet property&#8208;determining functional group. Herein, we introduce 6&#8208;thioguanine (TG) as a supramolecular receptor for unique tridentate receptor&#8208;analyte complexation,achieving &#8805; 95% identification accuracy among 16 polyfunctional analogs across three scenarios: glycerol derivatives, disubstituted propanes, and vicinal diols. Crucially, we demonstrate distinct spectral changes induced by the tridentate interaction between TG&#8217;s three anchoring points and all the analyte&#8217;s functional groups, even the least reactive ones. Notably, H&#8208;bond networks formed in the TG&#8208;analyte complexes demonstrate additive effect in binding strength originating from good bond linearity, cooperativity, and resonance, thus strengthens complexation events and amplifies the differences in spectral changes induced among analytes. It also enhances spectral consistency by selectively form a sole configuration that is stronger than the respective analyte&#8208;analyte interaction. Finally, we achieve 95.4% accuracy for multiplex identification of a mixture consisting of multiple polyfunctional analogs. We envisage that extension to other multidentate non&#8208;covalent interactions enables the development of interference&#8208;free small molecule&#8208;based sensors for various (bio)chemical analysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Asymmetric Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) Reaction Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8211;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;Aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8208;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8208;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90% energy efficiency and a 100% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E = 1.4 V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Photocatalysts: A Nanohouse Design Improves Photocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) is a promising route for environment remediation and sustainable ammonia synthesis. To design efficient photocatalysts, the recently emerged nanoarchitectonics approach holds great promise. Here, we report a nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst with high photocatalytic NitRR performance. The nano&#8208;house has a floor of plate&#8208;like metal organic framework&#8208;based photocatalyst (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), on which another photocatalyst Co(OH)2 nanosheet is grown while ZIF&#8208;8 hollow cages are also constructed as the surrounding wall/roof. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the positively charged, highly porous and hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 wall can modulate the environment in the nanohouse by (i) NO3&#8208; enrichment / NH4+ discharge and (ii) suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In combination with the enhanced electron&#8208;hole separation and strong redox capability in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125@Co(OH)2 S&#8208;scheme heterjunction confined in the nano&#8208;house, the designed photocatalyst delivers an ammonia yield of 2454.9 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02% at 400 nm in pure water. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalytic NitRR photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pressure&#8208;induced Emission Enhancement and Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving enhanced or blue&#8208;shifted emission from piezochromic materials remains a major challenge. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for the development of piezochromic materials owing to their dynamic structures and adjustable optical properties, where the emission behaviors are not solely determined by the functional groups, but are also greatly influenced by the specific geometric arrangement. Nevertheless, this area remains relatively understudied. In this study, a successful synthesis of a series of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying topologies, dimensions, and linkages was conducted, followed by an investigation of their structural and emission properties under hydrostatic pressure generated by a diamond anvil cell. Consequently, these COFs exhibited distinct piezochromic behaviors, particularly a remarkable pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE) phenomenon with a 16&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity from three&#8208;dimensional COFs, surpassing the performance of CPMs and most organic small molecules with PIEE behavior. On the contrary, three two&#8208;dimensional COFs with flexible structures exhibited rare blue&#8208;shifted emission, whereas the variants with rigid and conjugated structures showed common red&#8208;shifted and reduced emission. Mechanism research further revealed that these different piezochromic behaviors were primarily determined by interlayer distance and interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for an impressive duration of over 85 hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) due to its favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar-to-hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) due to its favored proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone-based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS-COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70% of the backward reaction and a three-fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7 &#956;mol h-1 g-1, ranking among the highest reported for organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring dynamics of a charge transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited state emission from triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation via dark T1, their energetics and electron transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1 eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1 eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57 V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT state toward efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of Native Lignin Structural Features with Gel&#8208;Phase 2D&#8208;HSQC0 Reveals Lignin Structural Changes During Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a method featuring an extrapolated time&#8208;zero Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) sequence on whole cell walls samples, we can successfully quantify native lignin's structural features. Applying this tool to compare whole cell wall samples to extracted lignin reveals fundamental differences in the apparent linkage distribution within the polymer, which provides insight into lignin's fractionation mechanism.







Abstract
Our ability to study and valorize the lignin fraction of biomass is hampered by the fundamental and still unmet challenge of precisely quantifying native lignin's structural features. Here, we developed a rapid elevated&#8208;temperature 1H&#8722;13C Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) NMR method that enables this precise quantification of native lignin structural characteristics even with whole plant cell wall (WPCW) NMR spectroscopy, overcoming fast spin relaxation in the gel phase. We also formulated a Gaussian fitting algorithm to perform automatic and reliable spectral integration. By combining HSQC0 measurements with yield measurements following depolymerisation, we can confirm the combinatorial nature of radical coupling reactions during biosynthesis leading to a random sequential organization of linkages within a largely linear lignin chain. Such analyses illustrate how this analytical method can greatly facilitate the study of native lignin structure, which can then be used for fundamental studies or to understand lignin depolymerization methods like reductive catalytic fractionation or aldehyde&#8208;assisted fractionation.

         <title>Alumina &#8211; Stabilized SEI and CEI in Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin film (10&#8197;&#956;m) of alumina (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated on both sides of commercial polypropene separators, then transferred onto both anode and cathode surfaces during cell assembly. This creates both artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) that enhance electrochemical kinetics of potassium metal batteries (KMBs).







Abstract
Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated onto both sides of commercial polypropene separator to create artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and artificial cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) in potassium metal batteries (KMBs). This significantly enhances the stability, including of KMBs with Prussian Blue (PB) cathodes. For example, symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2 and 3.0&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2. Alumina modified separators promote electrolyte wetting and increase ionic conductivity (0.59 vs. 0.2&#8197;mS/cm) and transference number (0.81 vs. 0.23). Cryo&#8208;stage focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis of cycled modified anode demonstrates dense and planar electrodeposits, versus unmodified baseline consisting of metal filaments (dendrites) interspersed with pores and SEI. Alumina&#8208;modified CEI also suppresses elemental Fe crossover and reduces cathode cracking. Mesoscale modeling of metal &#8211; SEI interactions captures crucial role of intrinsic heterogeneities, illustrating how artificial SEI affects reaction current distribution, conductivity and morphological stability.

         <title>On Tautomerism and Amphoterism: An In&#8208;Depth Structural and Physicochemical Characterization of Ammeline and Some of Its Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammeline was solved for the first time nearly 200&#8197;years after its discovery by Justus von Liebig. Moreover, several salts of ammeline were synthesized and structurally characterized to study its amphoteric behavior and the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure in the solid. Finally, the potential of ammeline as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials was examined.







Abstract
Ammeline is a simple, readily available, molecular compound, which has been known for nearly 200&#8197;years. Despite that, no proper structural characterization of ammeline has been conducted so far. For this reason, the prevalent tautomeric form of ammeline in the solid remained unknown to this date. In the course of this study, its crystal structure was finally established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In this structure, ammeline is exclusively found as its 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one tautomer and adopts layered structure with an exceptionally high hydrogen bond density. Ammeline shows an interesting amphoteric behavior. Therefore, the synthesis and structural characterization of some of its salts were carried out to investigate the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure. In particular, the crystal structure of silver ammelinate monohydrate was solved as the first reported structure containing deprotonated ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three different modifications of ammelinium perchlorate were elucidated and the transformation conditions between them were studied. Lastly, the crystal structure of ammelinediium diperchlorate monohydrate, containing unprecedented doubly protonated ammeline, was determined. The products&#8217; thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The perchlorate salts were additionally examined for their potential as insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Donor1&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor2 Motifs Regulating Local Charge of Intercalated Single Cobalt Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Amongst, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF exhibited exceptional activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) by various bipyridines. The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structure can induce the oriented electron transfer from dual donors to the Co center, promoting CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance. Herein, intercalated single Co sites coordinated by imine&#8208;N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties via a molecular engineering strategy.

&lt;p&gt;The interlayer Co-imine N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper-based imine-COFs with distinct electronic moieties for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Amongst, Co/Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TPA-COF exhibited exceptional activity and tunable syngas (CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by various bipyridines. The interlayer Co-imine N motifs on the donor&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-acceptor-donor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; structure can induce the oriented electron transfer from dual donors to the Co center, promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance. Herein, intercalated single Co sites coordinated by imine-N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper-based imine-COFs with distinct electronic moieties via a molecular engineering strategy. It is confirmed that the charge delivery property and local charge distribution of these heterometallic frameworks can be profoundly influenced by electronic structures. Among these featured structures with mixed-state copper clusters, Co/Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TPA-COF stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity and tunable syngas (CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ratio by changing various bipyridines. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that interlayer Co-imine N motifs on the donor&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-acceptor-donor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; structures facilitate the formation of a highly separated electron-hole state, which effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from dual electron donors to Co centers, achieving an enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and reduction. This work opens up an avenue for the design of high-performance COF-based catalysts for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upgrading Electrolyte Antioxidant Chemistry by Constructing Potential Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external method to quantitatively analyze the oxidation stability of electrolyte systems is proposed. It was shown that &#8220;anion&#8208;less&#8221; solvated structures are more resistant to oxidation than &#8220;anion&#8208;rich&#8221; ones owing to the weakening of the anion polarization effect. These findings provide a molecular perspective for electrolyte design in rechargeable high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal Batteries.







Abstract
Rational design of advanced electrolytes to improve the high&#8208;voltage capability has been attracting wide attention as one critical solution to enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the limited understanding of electrolyte antioxidant chemistry as well as the lack of valid quantization approaches have resulted in knowledge gap, which hinders the formulation of new electrolytes. Herein, we construct a standard curve based on representative solvation structures to quantify the oxidation stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes, which reveals the linear correlation between the oxidation potential and the atomic charge of the least oxidation&#8208;resistant solvent. Dictated by the regularity between solvation composition and oxidation potential, a (Trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte dominated by anion&#8208;less solvation structures was designed to optimize the cycling performance of 4.5&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Li||3.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8208;LiCoO2 batteries, which maintained 80&#8201;% capacity retention even after 440 cycles. The consistency of experimental and computational results validates the proposed principles, offering a fundamental guideline to evaluate and design aggressive electrochemical systems.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite Membranes for High&#8208;Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite is a benchmark membrane material for natural gas upgrading. The membranes were facilely synthesized by adopting the novel FAU&#8208;CHA seeds. An excellent CO2/CH4 separation performance was achieved even under pressure up to 6.1&#8197;MPa. The successful scaled&#8208;up synthesis paves the way for practical applications of zeolite membranes for gas separation.







Abstract
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis condition range significantly constrains scale&#8208;up preparation. Herein, we propose a facile interzeolite conversion approach using the FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis on hollow fiber substrates. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3&#8197;&#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24&#8208;96&#8197;h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending the synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K, the membranes showed an average CO2 permeance of (5.2&#177;0.5)&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 (1530&#8197;GPU), with an average CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity of 143&#177;7. Minimal defects ensure a high selectivity of 126 with a CO2 permeation flux of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 6.1&#8197;MPa feed pressure, far surpassing requirements for industrial applications. The feasibility for successful scale&#8208;up of our approach was further demonstrated by the batch synthesis of 40&#8197;cm&#8208;long hollow fiber SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite membranes exhibiting CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity up to 400 (0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K) without using sweep gas.

[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) synthesized by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dipyrrolyethenes show roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. Upon oxidation, the 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave N&#8208;fusion and pyrrole&#8208;rearranged products, which were effectively dimerized upon treatment with CuCl.







Abstract
Exploration of expanded porphyrins with unprecedented reactivities has remained important. Here [22]pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) were synthesized as a constitutional isomer of sapphyrin by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;di(pyrro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)ethenes. These pentaphyrins display roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. The 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave an N&#8208;fused product and an unprecedented pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product, depending upon the oxidation conditions. Remarkably, upon the metalation with CuCl, the N&#8208;fused product and the pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product afforded an inner &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled face&#8208;to&#8208;face CuII complex dimer and an outer &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled lateral CuII complex dimer, respectively, in fairly good yields. Further, [22]pentaphyrin(2.0.1.1.0) fused with a NiII porphyrin was effectively dimerized upon oxidation with MnO2 to give a 16&#8211;16&#8217; directly linked dl&#8208;dimer.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Pure Covalent Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized four chiral molecular tubes by condensing enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine with luminescent tetraformyl precursors. Within the framework of these tubes, the stereochirality of the bisamino building blocks was transferred and amplified, leading to planar chirality of the tubes. These tubes thus demonstrate a promising approach to CPL&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self&#8208;assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (trans&#8208;CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo&#8208;chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |glum| up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL&#8208;active materials.

&lt;p&gt;We synthesized four chiral molecular tubes by condensing enantiomerically pure &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine with luminescent tetraformyl precursors. Within the framework of these tubes, the stereochirality of the bisamino building blocks was transferred and amplified, leading to planar chirality of the tubes. These tubes thus demonstrate a promising approach to CPL-active materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self-assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo-chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL-active materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Lipid Heterogeneity in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane with a Super&#8208;photostable Environment&#8208;Sensitive Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive probe for imaging inner mitochondrial membranes is presented by Masayasu Taki, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404328). The probe can visualize the lipid properties of the membranes as it alters spatiotemporally in living cells. Peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the inner membrane results in membrane remodeling, which leads to an increase in membrane order.

         <title>Back Cover: Hexabenzoheptacene: A Longitudinally Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Local Aromaticity and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A longitudinally helical molecular carbon featuring six benzene rings benzannulated to zigzag edges of a heptacene core, was synthesized by Lei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202407547). The steric congestion introduced by the benzannulation pattern causes the molecular carbon to adopt a helical heptacene core with local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The molecular carbon with two&#8208;dimensional crystal packing exhibits excellent charge transport properties.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Spinel Octahedral Sites via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; Type Orbital Coupling to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~ 0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.</dc:description>

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Elevated Working Voltage by Na+/Vacancy Ordering and Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage by Transition&#8208;Metal Honeycomb Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na+/vacancy ordering in sodium&#8208;ion layered oxide cathodes is widely believed to deteriorate the structural stability and retard the Na+ diffusion kinetics, but its unexplored potential advantages remain elusive. Herein, we prepared a P2&#8208;Na0.8Cu0.22Li0.08Mn0.67O2 (NCLMO&#8208;12h) material featuring moderate Na+/vacancy and transition&#8208;metal (TM) honeycomb orderings. The appropriate Na+/vacancy ordering significantly enhances the operating voltage and the TM honeycomb ordering effectively strengthens the layered framework. Compared with the disordered material, the well&#8208;balanced dual&#8208;ordering NCLMO&#8208;12h cathode affords a boosted working voltage from 2.85&#160;to 3.51 V, a remarkable ~20% enhancement in energy density, and a superior cycling stability (capacity retention of 86.5% after 500 cycles). The solid&#8208;solution reaction with a nearly "zero&#8208;strain"&#160;character, the charge compensation mechanisms, and the reversible inter&#8208;layer Li migration upon sodiation/desodiation are unraveled by systematic in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations. This study breaks the stereotype surrounding Na+/vacancy ordering and provides a new avenue for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;durability sodium layered oxide cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Bis(hydrosilane)&#8722;Coinage Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Use as Catalysts for Outer&#8208;Sphere C=O Hydrosilylation Not Involving Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes by chloride abstraction from the neutral metal chloride precursors with Na[BArF4] is described. Unlike previously reported hydrosilane&#8208;stabilized copper and silver complexes, the presented complexes are cationic and feature two bidentate ortho&#8208;(silylphenyl)phosphine ligands. These complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, revealing that both Si&#8211;H bonds are activated by the Lewis acidic cationic metal center. The new complexes were found to be effective in catalytic carbonyl hydrosilylation, leading to the corresponding silyl ethers under mild conditions without the addition of an external base. Combined mechanistic control experiments and quantum chemical calculations support an ionic outer&#8208;sphere mechanism, in which a neutral metal alkoxide species instead of a metal hydride is the key intermediate that interacts with the silylcarboxonium ion to generate the silyl ether.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in&#8208;situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic H2O2 generation in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes &#8211; Mechanistic insight from scanning electrochemical microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the anodic H2O2 generation, it has been shown that the electrolyte composition can steer the reaction pathway toward increased H2O2 generation. Previous efforts made on composition optimization found that the impact of the molar fraction of carbonate species varies for different anodes, and therefore, controversies remain concerning the reaction pathways as well as the species involved in H2O2 formation. Considering that water oxidation results in the liberation of protons within the anode microenvironment, the corresponding acidification would cause an equilibrium shift between carbonate species, which in turn may modulate the reaction pathway. We determined the changes in the fraction of carbonate species in the vicinity of an anode by performing local pH measurements using a Au nanoelectrode positioned in close proximity to an operating anode by shear&#8208;force scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It could be confirmed that the main anionic species at the interface is HCO3&#8208;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the pH value in the bulk. The simultaneous use of a Au&#8208;Pt double barrel microelectrode in generator&#8208;collector SECM measurements demon&#173;strates that the local HCO3&#8208; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk pH of the electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;like Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Materials Based on Polyfluorinated Imidazolium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8208;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of iron&#8208;based single atom materials for general and efficient synthesis of amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines. The synthetic protocol of Fe&#8208;SACs is based on primary pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica resulting in the formation of unique mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon support with the pore size controlled by the size of the original silica nanoparticles. The resulting stable and reusable Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.</dc:description>

         <title>The &#8220;Pull Effect&#8221; of a Hanging ZnII&#160;on Improving the Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity with Co Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the challenge of cleaving O&#8722;O bonds at single Co sites, mononuclear Co complexes typically show poor selectivity for the four&#8208;electron (4e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report on selective 4e&#8722; ORR catalyzed by a Co porphyrin with a hanged ZnII ion. Inspired by Cu/Zn&#8208;superoxide dismutase, we designed and synthesized 1&#8208;CoZn with a hanging ZnII at the second sphere of a Co porphyrin. Complex 1&#8208;CoZn is much more effective than its Zn&#8208;lacking analogues to catalyze the 4e&#8722; ORR in neutral aqueous solutions, giving an electron number of 3.91 per O2 reduction. With spectroscopic studies, the hanging ZnII was demonstrated to be able to facilitate the electron transfer from CoII to O2, through an electronic &#8220;pull effect&#8221;, to give CoIII&#8208;superoxo. Theoretical studies further suggested that this &#8220;pull effect&#8221; plays crucial roles in assisting O&#8722;O bond cleavage. This work is significant to present a new strategy of hanging a ZnII to improve O2 activation and O&#8722;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

The largely unknown bioactivity and mode of action are partially caused by the poor availability of the compounds via microbiological and chemical approaches. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we have developed the on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation strategy to synthesize peptides containing N&#8208;terminal DKP derived cyclic amidine structure, in which the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization mediated by HgCl2 activation of thioamides was the key step. Leveraging from this new strategy, we finished the total syntheses of streptamidine and klebsazolicin. Meanwhile, eleven klebsazolicin analogues were synthesized for its structure&#8208;activity relationship study.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Electrocatalysis and Spatial Nanoconfinement to Accelerate Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Aqueous Zn&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc batteries based on the conversion&#8208;type sulfur cathodes are promising in energy storage system due to the high theoretical energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, the multi&#8208;electron solid&#8208;state intermediate conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes generally possess sluggish kinetics, which leads to lower discharge voltage and inefficient sulfur utilization, thus suppressing the practical energy density. Herein, sulfur nanoparticles derived from metal&#8722;organic frameworks confined in&#8208;situ within electrospun fibers derived sulfur and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (S@S,N&#8208;CNF) composite, which possesses yolk&#8722;shell S@C nanostructure, is fabricated through successive sulfidation, pyrolysis, and sulfide oxidation processes, and served as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for Zn&#8722;S battery. The S and N dopants on carbon can collectively catalyse sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) by lowering energy barrier and accelerating kinetics to increase discharge voltage and specific capacity. Meanwhile, the yolk&#8722;shell S@C structure with spatially confined S nanoparticle yolks is beneficial to improve charge transfer and lower activation energy, thus further expediting SRR kinetics. Furthermore, extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that S and N dual&#8208;doping can thermodynamically and dynamically reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (i.e., the transformation of *ZnS4 into *ZnS2) for the overall SRR, thereby significantly accelerating SRR kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active site may also boost catalytic performance. Here we have designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only govern surface process by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with CO faradaic efficiency of 97%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Level&#8208;Macroscopic Structure&#8208;Activity of Inhomogeneous Localized Aggregates Enabled Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hybrid Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt&#8208;water&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic&#8208;level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes. This highlights a distinct category of micelle&#8208;like structure electrolytes featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates, enabled by appropriate low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions. Remarkably, the electrolyte enables exceptional high solubility, accommodating up to 29.8 m zinc triflate within aqueous micelles. This configuration maintains an intra&#8208;micellar salt&#8208;in&#8208;water setup, allowing for a broad electrochemical window (up to 3.86 V), low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultralow&#8208;temperature zinc ion conductivity (1.58 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8211;80&#176;C). Building upon the unique nature of the inhomogeneous localized aggregates, this micelle&#8208;like electrolyte facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping, even at &#8211;80&#176;C. The assembled Zn||PANI battery showcases an impressive capacity of 71.8 mAh g&#8722;1 and an extended lifespan of over 3000 cycles at &#8722;80&#176;C. This study opens up a promising approach in electrolyte design that transcends conventional local atomic solvation structures, broadening the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Mediated Modulation of Spatial Internal Stresses of Hydrogels for Complex 3D Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel actuators with complex 3D initial shapes show numerous important applications, but it remains challenging to fabricate such actuators. This article describes a polyelectrolyte&#8208;based strategy for modulating small&#8208;scale internal stresses within hydrogels to construct complex actuators with tailored 3D initial shapes. Introducing polyelectrolytes into precursor solutions significantly enhances the volume shrinkage of hydrogel networks during polymerization, allowing us to modulate internal stresses. Photopolymerization of these polyelectrolyte&#8208;containing solutions through a mask produces mechanically strong hydrogel sheets with large patterned internal stresses. Consequently, these hydrogel sheets attain complex 3D initial shapes at equilibrium, in contrast to the planar initial configuration of 2D actuators. We demonstrate that these 3D actuators can reversibly transform into other 3D shapes (i.e., 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape transformations) in response to external stimuli. Additionally, we develop a predictive model based on the Flory&#8208;Rehner theory to analyze the polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated shrinking behaviors of hydrogel networks during polymerization, allowing precise modulation of shrinkage and internal stress. This polyelectrolyte&#8208;boosted shrinking mechanism paves a route to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance 3D hydrogel actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings Engineered via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered extensive attention owing to their highly ordered porous structure and physicochemical properties. However, their practical application often requires their integration with various substrates, which is challenging because of their weakly adhesive nature and the diversity of substrates that exhibit different properties. Herein, we report the use of amorphous metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings to facilitate the growth of crystalline MOF coatings on various particle and planar substrates. Crystalline MOFs with different metal ions and morphologies were successfully deposited on substrates (13 types) of varying sizes, shapes, and surface chemistries. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the coated crystalline MOFs (e.g., composition, thickness) could be tuned using different synthesis conditions. The engineered MOF&#8208;coated membranes demonstrated excellent liquid and gas separation performance, exhibiting a high H2 permeance of 63200 GPU and a H2/CH4 selectivity of 10.19, likely attributable to the thin nature of the coating (~180 nm), which can be realized using the present strategy. Considering the vast array of MOFs available (&gt;90,000) and the diversity of substrates, this work is expected to pave the way for creating a wide range of MOF composites and coatings with potential applications in biomedicine, environmental science, and agriculture.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Gaseous Ammonia: Stepping Over the Nitrogen Energy Canyon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As ammonia continues to gain more and more interest as a promising hydrogen carrier compound, so does the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR). To avoid the liberation of H2 in a reverse Haber&#8208;Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N2, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value&#8208;added nitrite (NO2&#8208;), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi&#8208;metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H2 at the cathode. This will double the amount of H2 per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4&#8208;1.8 V vs. RHE at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2).

To avoid the liberation of H2 in a reverse Haber-Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N2, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value-added nitrite (NO2-), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi-metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H2 at the cathode. This will double the amount of H2 per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4-1.8 V vs. RHE at 50 mA&#183;cm-2). A selectivity study demonstrated that some of the catalyst compositions were able to produce significant amounts of NO2-, and further investigations using the most promising catalyst composition Nif_AlCoCrCuFe integrated within a GDE demonstrated up to 88% Faradaic efficiency for NO2- at the anode coupled to close to 100% Faradaic efficiency for the cathodic H2 production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Conversion Chemistry in Intercalation Host for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion&#8208;type anode materials with high theoretical capacities play a pivotal role in developing future aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs). However, their sustainable applications have long been impeded by the poor cycling stability and sluggish redox kinetics. Here we show that confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host could overcome the above challenges. Using sodium titanates as a model intercalation host, an integrated layered anode material of iron oxide hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate (FeNTO) is demonstrated. The conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer, enabling superlow redox polarization (ca. 4&#8208;6 times reduced), ultralong lifespan (up to 8700 cycles) and excellent rate performance. Notably, the charge compensation of interlayer via universal cation intercalation into host endows FeNTO with the capability of operating well in a broad range of aqueous electrolytes (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, etc.). We further demonstrate the large&#8208;scale synthesis of FeNTO thin film and powder, and rational design of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state high&#8208;voltage ARB pouch cells powering wearable electronics against extreme mechanical abuse. This work demonstrates a powerful confinement means to access disruptive electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8211;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based materials have been utilized as effective catalysts for hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR), however the insufficient selectivity and productivity still hindered the further industrial applications. In this work, we report the Fe&#8208;O4 motif activated graphitic carbon material which enabled highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis operating at high current density with excellent anti&#8208;poisoning property. In the bulk production test, the concentration of H2O2 cumulated to 8.6% in 24 h and the corresponding production rate of 33.5 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 outperformed all previously reported materials. Theoretical model backed by in&#8208;situ characterization verified &#945;&#8208;C surrounding the Fe&#8208;O4 motif as the actual reaction site in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics aspects. The strategy of activating carbon reaction site by metal center via oxo&#8208;bridge provides inspiring insights for the rational design of carbon materials for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the Charge&#8208;Density of Tetrahedral Cobalt(II) Centers through Carbon&#8208;Layer Modulation Promotes C&#8208;H Activation in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction (PDH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of active metal centers plays an indispensable role in regulating catalytic reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis, developing other metals as promoters to decorate electronic state is a common strategy, while non&#8208;metal component of carbon as electronic additives to regulate d&#8208;band center has rarely been studied in thermal&#8208;catalysis field. Herein, we report electron&#8208;deficient tetrahedral Co(II) (Td&#8208;cobalt(II)) centers through carbon&#8208;layer modulation for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is indicated that bifunctional sites of both Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and metallic&#8208;cobalt are designed, and the in&#8208;situ generated carbon through the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt can cover the inactive metallic&#8208;cobalt and tailor d&#8208;band of active Td&#8208;cobalt(II) simultaneously. More importantly, the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer is proposed to decrease electron density of Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and make d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level, consequently promotes C&#8208;H activation in PDH reaction. This study provides new perspective for the utilization of inactive carbon as electronic promoters and unlocks new opportunity to fabricate efficient PDH and other heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a results, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64% at 260 mA cm&#8208;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32% at 140 mA cm&#8208;2 &#8212; nearly 1.3 times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3 V at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring, and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyethers through epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.







Abstract
Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclization was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid.

     alt="Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo-Selective Epoxide-to-Epoxonium Ring-Opening Cascades"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six-membered-ring, and fused seven-, eight-, and nine-membered-ring polyethers through epoxide-to-epoxonium ring-opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring-opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring-opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PFTB (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl alcohol) and found that all-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; products were formed via epoxide-to-epoxonium ring-opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl-to-epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-selective cyclization was inhibition of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-selective hydroxyl-to-epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow-release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six-membered-ring and fused seven-, eight-, and nine-membered-ring polyether fragments by epoxide-to-epoxonium ring-opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide-to-epoxonium ring-opening cyclization of polyepoxide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8722;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt SAs through the strategy of external ligand grafting on MOFs, the electron density and steric factor of Pt(II) centers thereby were achieved accurate modulation. In addition, the incorporation of Pt(bpy)Cl2 as an electron acceptor induced the efficient interface migration of photoinduced electrons, relizing a 225&#8208;times improvement of photocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients.







Abstract
The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4&#8197;days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.

         <dc:description>
Borylation and subsequent halide abstraction of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand affords a cationic complex featuring a rare linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes an unique chain elongation reaction via iminoborane carboration reaction with bis(tert&#8208;butyl)iminoborane, giving access to a five&#8208;atom B/N chain.







Abstract
Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.

         <title>Selective Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides with an Ex Situ Gaseous Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that enables amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8208;aniline crosslinking by a minimalist linchpin strategy was used to form macrocyclic urea or carbamate products in unprotected peptides. The reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide range of other amino acids. Cyclization of bioactive cyclic peptides provided a variety of bicyclic peptides with novel topologies.







Abstract
Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking through a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal&#8208;mediated and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting&#8208;group strategies.

Chemical synthesis performed under harsh reaction conditions often requires the need for protecting groups to prevent off&#8208;target reactions. While traditional chemical introduction of protecting groups disagrees with the principles of green chemistry, biocatalysis provides a promising alternative. Herein, we present an unprecedented enzymatic approach for the efficient synthesis of carbamate&#8208;protected amines in water achieving up to 99&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Biocatalysis provides an attractive approach to facilitate synthetic reactions in aqueous media. Motivated by the discovery of promiscuous aminolysis activity of esterases, we exploited the esterase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) for the synthesis of carbamates from different aliphatic, aromatic, and arylaliphatic amines and a set of carbonates such as dimethyl&#8208;, dibenzyl&#8208;, or diallyl carbonate. Thus, aniline and benzylamine derivatives, aliphatic and even secondary amines could be efficiently converted into the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)&#8208; or allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)&#8208;protected products in bulk water, with (isolated) yields of up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#9651;H) and entropy barrier (&#9651;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#9651;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#9651;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#9651;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Nanoneedle Electrodes for Dopamine Detection in Drosophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in Drosophila larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).







Abstract
In vivo electrochemistry in small brain regions or synapses requires nanoelectrodes with long straight tips for submicron scale measurements. Nanoelectrodes can be fabricated using a Nanoscribe two&#8208;photon printer, but annealed tips curl if they are long and thin. We propose a new pulling&#8208;force strategy to fabricate a straight carbon nanoneedle structure. A micron&#8208;width bridge is printed between two blocks. The annealed structure shrinks during pyrolysis, and the blocks create a pulling force to form a long, thin, and straight carbon bridge. Parameterization study and COMSOL modeling indicate changes in the block size, bridge size and length affect the pulling force and bridge shrinkage. Electrodes were printed on niobium wires, insulated with aluminum oxide, and the bridge cut with focused ion beam (FIB) to expose the nanoneedle tip. Annealed needle diameters ranged from 400&#8197;nm to 5.25&#8197;&#956;m and length varied from 50.5&#8197;&#956;m to 146&#8197;&#956;m. The electrochemical properties are similar to glassy carbon, with good performance for dopamine detection with fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry. Nanoelectrodes enable biological applications, such as dopamine detection in a specific Drosophila brain region. Long and thin nanoneedles are generally useful for other applications such as cellular sensing, drug delivery, or gas sensing.

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processible and stable organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material ATT was facilely prepare by a spontaneous and quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Cycloreversion. ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photo&#8208;irradiation, enabling its applications in the high&#8208;temperature processes, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;fusion, photo&#8208;stamp, photo&#8208;weld and photo&#8208;controlled shaper memory.







Abstract
Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90&#8201;% in just 15&#8197;min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000&#8197;nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.

         <title>Ordering Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd Catalysts onto Orderly Mesoporous SrTiO3&#8208;Crystal Nanotubular Networks for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work resolved the inherent contradiction between the superior pore structure and crystallinity of metal oxides by developing an updated synthesis method using the electrospinning technique, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer in photocatalytic heterogeneous reactions. With the assistance of ordered Cu&#8722;Pd alloy, the catalysts exhibit a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of fuels has garnered significant attention, with SrTiO3 emerging as a potential candidate for photocatalysis due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. However, selectively converting CO2 into fuels with desired reaction products remains a grand challenge. Herein, we design an updated method via an aging strategy based on the electrospinning technique to synthesize a single&#8208;crystalline Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 nanotubular networks with self&#8208;assembled orderly mesopores, further modified by Cu&#8722;Pd alloy. It exhibits both high crystallinity and superior cross&#8208;linked mesoporous structures, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer, with a remarkable enhancement from 0.025&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 1.090&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 in the CO production rate. Meanwhile, the ordered arrangement of Cu and Pd atoms on the (111) surface can promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2 to *COOH), which is also responsible for its good activity. The presence of CuO in the reaction confers a significant advantage for CO desorption, leading to a remarkable CO selectivity of 95.54&#8201;%. This work highlights new insights into developing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts.

n&#8208;Propanol can be efficiently produced by ampere&#8208;level CO2 electroreduction by a Cu2O/Cu catalyst with bicontinuous structure. The catalyst is assembled by nanodomains (&lt;10&#8197;nm) of Cu2O and Cu and possesses numerous grain boundaries between the Cu and Cu2O phases.







Abstract
n&#8208;propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n&#8208;propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n&#8208;propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra&#8208;small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n&#8208;propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO&#8208;*CO coupling and *CO&#8208;*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n&#8208;propanol.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;DNA Carriers Co&#8208;Deliver Photosensitizer and siRNA for Light&#8208;Promoted Gene Transfection and Hypoxia&#8208;Relieved Photodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Developing synthetic polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras provides new opportunities for material development. Herein, we demonstrate that the micellar nanostructures self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA chimeras can efficiently, straightforwardly, and bio&#8208;compatibly co&#8208;deliver siRNA and organic photosensitizers, resulting in significantly enhanced gene/photodynamic synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy.







Abstract
Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.

         <title>Protonation of an Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis under Visible Light up to 700&#8201;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation is found to be a simple and efficient strategy to upgrade the COFs&#8217; photocatalytic activity for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation extends the light absorption, provides proton sources for H2O2 generation, simplifies the reaction pathways, and increases the H2O2 selectivity from oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for H2O2 production from water via oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of COFs for efficient H2O2 production indubitably hinges on an in&#8208;depth understanding of their ORR mechanisms. In this work, taking an imine&#8208;linked COF as an example, we demonstrate that protonation of the functional units such as imine, amine, and triazine, is a highly efficient strategy to upgrade the activity levels for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation not only extends the light absorption of the COF but also provides proton sources that directly participate in H2O2 generation. Notably, the protonation simplifies the reaction pathways of ORR to H2O2, i.e. from an indirect superoxide radical (

O2&#8226;-

 ${{O}_{2}^{\bullet -}}$



) mediated route to a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron route. Theoretical calculations confirm that the protonation favors H2O2 synthesis due to easy access of protons near the reaction sites that removes the energy barrier for generating *OOH intermediate. These findings not only extend the mechanistic insight into H2O2 photosynthesis but also provide a rational guideline for the design and upgradation of efficient COFs.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Thiazolines from 4&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehydes Using Vanillyl Alcohol Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols in the presence of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) occurred through a spontaneous condensation reaction followed by preferential enzymatic oxidation of the in situ generated C&#8722;N bond over other competing functional groups. The biocatalysts showed good substrate tolerance, and the enzymatic products could be chemically modified to expand the structural diversity.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles are commonly found in bioactive natural products and drugs. However, the biocatalytic tools for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis are limited. Herein, we report the discovery of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) as efficient biocatalysts for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from various 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols. The wild&#8208;type biocatalyst features a broad scope of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes. Though the scope of aminothiols is limited, it could be improved via semi&#8208;rational protein engineering, generating a variant to produce previously inaccessible cysteine&#8208;derived bioactive 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines using the wild&#8208;type VAO. Benefiting from the derivatizable functional groups in the enzymatic products, we further chemically modified these products to expand the chemical space, offering a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the green and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;thiazoline derivatives to prompt their use in drug discovery and catalysis.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [2]Catenanes and Cyclic Bis[2]catenanes via Orthogonal Metal&#8208;Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes were prepared efficiently via orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes displayed broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Although catenated cages have been widely constructed due to their unique and elegant topological structures, cyclic catenanes formed by the connection of multiple catenane units have been rarely reported. Herein, based on the orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we prepare a series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, whose structures are clearly evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes display broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. This work not only provides an efficient strategy for the construction of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes but also explores their applications as superior antibacterial agents, which will promote the construction of advanced supramolecular structures for biomedical applications.

         <title>Scalable and Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons has been proposed. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate that the selectivity is attributed to combined effects of in situ released protons during anodic oxidation and significant differences in H+ mobility among various solvents.







Abstract
The reduction of aromatic compounds constitutes a fundamental and ongoing area of investigation. The selective reduction of polycyclic aromatic compounds to give either fully or partially reduced products remains a challenge, especially in applications to complex molecules at scale. Herein, we present a selective electrochemical hydrogenation of polycyclic arenes conducted under mild conditions. A noteworthy achievement of this approach is the ability to finely control both the complete and partial reduction of specific aromatic rings within polycyclic arenes by judiciously varying the reaction solvents. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the pivotal role played by in situ proton generation and interface regulation in governing reaction selectivity. The reductive electrochemical conditions show a very high level of functional&#8208;group tolerance. Furthermore, this methodology represents an easily scalable reduction (demonstrated by the reduction of 1&#8197;kg scale starting material) using electrochemical flow chemistry to give key intermediates for the synthesis of specific drugs.

Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems offer a promising solution for solar energy storage. We present silver salts as a distinctive catalyst class capable of releasing stored energy from the promising dihydroazaborinine&#8208;based MOST system.

Abstract
Molecular solar thermal systems (MOST) represent an auspicious solution for the storage of solar energy. We report silver salts as a unique class of catalysts, capable of releasing the stored energy from the promising 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine based MOST system. Mechanistic investigations provided insights into the silver catalyzed thermal backreaction, concurrently unveiling the first crystal structure of a 2&#8208;aza&#8208;3&#8208;borabicyclo[2.2.0]hex&#8208;5&#8208;ene, the Dewar isomer of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine. Quantification of activation energies by kinetic experiments has elucidated the advantageous energy change associated with Lewis acid catalysts, a phenomenon corroborated through computational analysis. By means of low temperature NMR spectroscopy, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Ag+ to the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine were gained.

         <title>An Asymmetric Coumarin&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate as Efficient Fullerene&#8208;Free Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;band gap coumarin&#8208;anthracene&#8208;based D&#8208;A dyad was designed and synthesized. The molecule when applied as an acceptor into PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF blend exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.91&#8201;% in ternary organic solar cells.







Abstract
Asymmetric wide&#8208;band gap fullerene&#8208;free acceptors (FFAs) play a crucial role in organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized a simple asymmetric coumarin&#8208;anthracene conjugate named CA&#8208;CN with optical band gap of 2.1&#8197;eV in a single&#8208;step condensation reaction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis confirms various multiple intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. The molecular orbital energy levels of CA&#8208;CN estimated from cyclic voltammetry were found to be suitable for its use as an acceptor for OSCs. Binary OSCs fabricated using CA&#8208;CN as acceptor and PTB7&#8208;Th as the donor achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.13&#8201;%. We further demonstrate that the insertion of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of CA&#8208;CN as a third component in ternary OSCs with PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF as the host material achieved an impressive PCE of 14.91&#8201;%, an improvement of ~43&#8201;% compared to the PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF binary device (10.38&#8201;%). Importantly, the ternary blend enhances the absorption coverage from 400 to 800&#8197;nm and improves the morphology of the active layer. The findings highlight the efficacy of an asymmetric design approach for FFAs, which paves the way for developing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs at low cost.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Performance Cobalt&#8208;Based Environmental Catalysts from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Unveiling Overlooked Roles of Copper and Aluminum from Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of trace metals from current collectors on the activity of environmental catalysts converted from spent LIBs was revealed by a Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Al and Cu from current collectors could tune the d&#8208;band centre of active sites, leading to improved conductivity and strengthened chemisorption ability toward reactants, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of environmental catalysts converted from spent LIBs.







Abstract
Converting spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials into environmental catalysts has drawn more and more attention. Herein, we fabricated a Co3O4&#8208;based catalyst from spent LiCoO2 LIBs (Co3O4&#8208;LIBs) and found that the role of Al and Cu from current collectors on its performance is nonnegligible. The density functional theory calculations confirmed that the doping of Al and/or Cu upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Co. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was adopted to evaluate its activity. Interestingly, Al doping strengthened chemisorption for PMS (from &#8722;2.615&#8197;eV to &#8722;2.623&#8197;eV) and shortened Co&#8722;O bond length (from 2.540&#8197;&#197; to 2.344&#8197;&#197;) between them, whereas Cu doping reduced interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance (from 28.347&#8197;k&#937; to 6.689&#8197;k&#937;) excepting for the enhancement of the above characteristics. As expected, the degradation activity toward bisphenol A of Co3O4&#8208;LIBs (0.523&#8197;min&#8722;1) was superior to that of Co3O4 prepared from commercial CoC2O4 (0.287&#8197;min&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the reasons for improved activity were further verified by comparing activity with catalysts doped Al and/or Cu into Co3O4. This work reveals the role of elements from current collectors on the performance of functional materials from spent LIBs, which is beneficial to the sustainable utilization of spent LIBs.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadienes by Birch Reduction in the Presence of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete change in regioselectivity has been observed during the Birch reduction of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds. Alkyl aldehydes afford exclusively 1,4&#8208;isomers, whereas with ketones and aryl aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are isolated in good yields on a large scale. Such compounds are suitable precursors for further transformations.







Abstract
Birch reductions are well&#8208;known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;&#8208;position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;&#8208;position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, m&#8208; and p&#8208;toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93&#8201;% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4&#8201;:&#8201;1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only trans isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal meta selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Birch reductions are well-known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4-cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;-position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;-position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one-pot synthesis of 1,3-cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93&#8201;% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4&#8201;:&#8201;1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3-cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Picture: Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism for amine grafting in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402973). The image shows in a Warholian style how the adaptable response of the framework allows the rearrangement of pore windows necessary to enable the translocation and binding of tetraamines inside cavities that would otherwise be inaccessible. This behaviour is activated by the dynamic response of the heterometallic Ti2Ca2 clusters in MUV&#8208;10 in the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfinamidines via Asymmetric Nitrogen Transfer from N&#8722;H Oxaziridines to Sulfenamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines by electrophilic amination of sulfenamides with enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridines. The enantioenriched sulfinamidines show remarkable chemical and configurational stability against high temperature, acids, and bases in non&#8208;aqueous solution. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides is further demonstrated by employing enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.







Abstract
Sulfinamidines are promising aza&#8208;SIV chiral building blocks in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery. However, no report has documented their enantioselective synthesis. Here we present an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines via electrophilic amination of sulfenamides using an enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine. The resulting enantiomerically enriched primary sulfinamidines are configurationally stable at 90&#8201;&#176;C in solution and show remarkable stability against organic acids and bases under non&#8208;aqueous conditions. We also demonstrate a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides using N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.

         <title>Strong Swelling and Symmetrization in Siliceous Zeolites due to Hydrogen Insertion at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to other atoms or molecules, H2 enters both the pores and the framework cages of siliceous zeolites under high pressure. This results in strong swelling and symmetrization of the structures with very high hydrogen contents of 1.5&#8211;1.7 H2 molecules/SiO2 unit being obtained.







Abstract
Hydrogen and helium saturate the 1D pore systems of the high&#8208;silica (Si/Al&gt;30) zeolites Theta&#8208;One (TON), and Mobile&#8208;Twelve (MTW) at high pressure based on x&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. In TON, a strong 22&#8201;% volume increase occurs above 5&#8197;GPa with a transition from the collapsed P21 to a symmetrical, swelled Cmc21 form linked to an increase in H2 content from 12 H2/unit cell in the pores to 35 H2/unit cell in the pores and in the framework of the material. No transition and continuous collapse of TON is observed in helium indicating that the mechanism of H2 insertion is distinct from other fluids. The insertion of hydrogen in the larger pores of MTW results in a strong 11&#8201;% volume increase at 4.3&#8197;GPa with partial symmetrization followed by a second volume increase of 4.5&#8201;% at 7.5&#8197;GPa, corresponding to increases in hydrogen content from 43 to 67 and then to 93 H2/unit cell. Flexible 1D siliceous zeolites have a very high H2 capacity (1.5 and 1.7 H2/SiO2 unit for TON and MTW, respectively) due to H2 insertion in the pores and the framework, in contrast to other atoms and molecules, thereby providing a mechanism for strong swelling.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics achieving an unprecedented combination of high chemical robustness, excellent ferroelectricity and long&#8208;lived afterglow emission are reported by Chi Zhang, Honghan Fei et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407102). The strategy emphasizes the importance of high structural integrity in designing high&#8208;Curie temperature ferroelectrics, and the covalent interactions facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer to achieve long&#8208;lived phosphorescence.

         <title>Modulating the Microenvironments of&#160;Robust Metal Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are outstanding candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, most of reported HOFs suffer from poor stability and photocatalytic activity in the absence of Pt cocatalyst. Herein, a series of metal HOFs (Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X, X = COOMe, Br, tBu and OMe) have been rationally constructed based on dinuclear cobalt complexes, which exhibit exceptional stability in the presence of strong acid (12 M HCl) and strong base (5 M NaOH) for at least 10 days. More impressively, by varying the &#8208;X groups of the dinuclear cobalt complexes, the microenvironment of Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X can be modulated, giving rise to obviously di&#64256;erent photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#8208;X group sequence of &#8208;COOMe &gt; &#8208;Br &gt; &#8208;tBu &gt; &#8208;OMe. The optimized Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;COOMe shows H2 generation rate up to 12.8 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers and cocatalysts, which is superior to most reported Pt&#8208;assisted photocatalytic systems. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8208;X groups grafted on Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X possess different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, thus regulating the electronic structures of Co catalytic centres and proton activation barrier for H2 production, and leading to the distinctly di&#64256;erent photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double Twisted Nanographene with a Contorted Pyrene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mature synthetic methodologies enable us to rationally design and produce chiral nanographenes (NGs), most of which consist of multiple helical motifs. However, inherent chirality originating from twisted geometry has just emerged to be employed in chiral NGs. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive chiral NG constituted of orthogonally arranged two&#8208;fold twisted &#960;&#8208;skeletons at a contorted pyrene core&#160;which contributes to optical transitions of S0&#160;&#8594;&#160;S1&#160;and vice versa. The thus&#8208;obtained NG exhibited a robustness on its redox properties through 2e&#8211;&#160;uptake/release. The chemical oxidation generated stable radical cation whose absorption covers near&#8208;infrared I and II regions. Overall, the contorted pyrene core governs electronic nature of the chiral NG. The twist operation on NGs would be, therefore, a design strategy to alter conventional chirality induction on NGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s for Potential Alternatives to Engineering Plastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile fabrication, low material complexity and closed&#8208;loop recycling are essential for polymer plastics to alter their linear product economy towards a cradle&#8208;to&#8208;cradle one. Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are one way to achieve that, which intrinsically exhibit decent mechanical properties of the thermosets but could also be easily recycled like the thermoplastics. In this work, we introduce rigid ester structural motifs into dynamic poly(disulfide)s to form a series of dual polymer networks. Owning to the coherence of soft/rigid segments and the reversible sacrificial crosslinking, they exhibit tailorable properties and good resistance towards different chemicals. Their closed&#8208;loop recycling is achieved via mild solvolysis, maintaining materials&#8217; mechanical integrities. It offers a solution as a sustainable replacement for engineering plastics which are massively under production but hard to be recycled.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupled Electron&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Transfer Processes at a Liquid/Liquid Interface Decorated with Photoactive Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO4 particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid&#8208;liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2&#8208;dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO4 under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference &#8710;aq/oj between two reference electrodes in the electrolyte solutions and was intermittently illuminated with visible light (l &gt; 420 nm). The photogenerated holes caused oxidation of water to O2. Co(II) and O2 were detected at constant &#8710;aq/oj at an amperometric microelectrode (ME) facing the orifice of the MP in either the organic or the aqueous electrolyte. The overall current exhibits a photocurrent only in the &#8710;aq/oj&#8208;range, in which the IT of PF6&#8208; is kinetically limited. The amperometric detection of photogenerated products followed the same pattern as the photocurrent in the total current.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: from Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Fast Potassium Ion Kinetics: High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;life Potassium Dual&#8208;ion Battery for Operation at &#8208;60&#8451;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy storage devices operating at low temperatures are plagued by sluggish kinetics, reduced capacity, and notorious dendritic growth. Herein, novel potassium dual&#8208;ion batteries (PDIBs) capable of superior performance at &#8208;60&#176;C, and fabricated by combining MXenes and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as the anode and cathode, respectively, are presented. Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated. Theoretical calculations, crossover experiments, and in&#8208;situ XRD at room and low temperatures revealed that K+ tends to bind with solvent molecules rather than anions at subzero temperatures, which not only inhibits the participation of PF6&#8208; in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), but also guarantees co&#8208;intercalation behavior and suppresses undesirable K+ storage. The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti3C2 anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at &#8208;40&#176;C and &#8208;60&#176;C. Impressively, after charging&#8208;discharging for 20,000 cycles at &#8208;60&#176;C, the PDIB retained 86.7% of its initial capacity. This study reveals the influence of temperatures on MXenes and offers a unique design for dual&#8208;ion batteries operating at ultralow temperatures.</dc:description>

Herein, novel potassium dual-ion batteries (PDIBs) capable of superior performance at -60&#176;C, and fabricated by combining MXenes and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as the anode and cathode, respectively, are presented. Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated.

The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti3C2 anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at -40&#176;C and -60&#176;C.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Activation of Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds by Carbon&#8208;Centered Biradical via Intramolecular 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce a novel intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction that efficiently yields azetidine, oxetane, and indoline derivatives through a mechanism resembling the carbon analogue of the Norrish&#8211;Yang reaction. This process is facilitated by excited triplet&#8208;state carbon&#8208;centered biradicals, enabling the 1,5&#8208;HAT reaction&#160;by suppressing the critical 1,4&#8208;biradical intermediates from undergoing the Norrish Type II cleavage reaction, and pioneering unprecedented 1,6&#8208;HAT reactions initiated by excited triplet&#8208;state alkenes. We demonstrate the synthetic utility and compatibility of this method across various functional groups, validated through scope evaluation, large&#8208;scale synthesis, and derivatization. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling, kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8208;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8208;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8208;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8208;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8208;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945; = 0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Paired Electrolysis Enables Reductive Heck Coupling of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Among various methods to construct Csp2&#8211;Csp3 bonds, the reductive Heck reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes stands out due to its potential efficiency and broad substrate availability. However, traditional reductive Heck reactions are limited by the use of precious metal catalysts and/or limited aryl halide and alkene compatibility. Here, we present an electrochemically mediated, metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free reductive Heck reaction that tolerates both unactivated (hetero)aryl halides and diverse alkenes such as vinyl boronates and silanes. Detailed electrochemical and deuterium&#8208;labeling studies support that this transformation likely proceeds through a paired electrolysis pathway, in which acid generated by the oxidation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) at the anode intercepts an alkyl carbanion formed after radical&#8208;polar crossover at the cathode. As such, this approach offers a sustainable method for the construction of Csp2&#8211;Csp3 bonds from (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes, paving the way for the development of other electrochemically mediated olefin difunctionalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Photochemical C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated bis(diiminopyridine)cobalt complex enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles with chloro&#8208; and bromoarenes. Spectroscopic and computational studies elucidate the photoelectron transfer processes of the metal complex with triethylamine and a bromoarene, suggesting that electron transfer is facilitated by a preassembly of these molecules with the complex.







Abstract
Precious metal complexes remain ubiquitous in photoredox catalysis (PRC) despite concerted efforts to find more earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and replacements based on 3d metals in particular. Most otherwise plausible 3d metal complexes are assumed to be unsuitable due to short&#8208;lived excited states, which has led researchers to prioritize the pursuit of longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes through careful molecular design. However, we report herein that the C&#8722;H arylation of pyrroles and related substrates (which are benchmark reactions for assessing the efficacy of photoredox catalysts) can be achieved using a simple and readily accessible octahedral bis(diiminopyridine) cobalt complex, [1&#8208;Co](PF6)2. Notably, [1&#8208;Co]2+ efficiently functionalizes both chloro&#8208; and bromoarene substrates despite the short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the key photoexcited intermediate *[1&#8208;Co]2+ (8&#8197;ps). We present herein the scope of this C&#8722;H arylation protocol and provide mechanistic insights derived from detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. These indicate that, despite its transient existence, reduction of *[1&#8208;Co]2+ is facilitated via pre&#8208;assembly with the NEt3 reductant, highlighting an alternative strategy for the future development of 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed PRC.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acid Loading onto a Bacterial Thiotemplate Assembly Line via a Multienzyme Gateway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular warhead for the virulence factor malleicyprol derives from trigonic acid, a cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid. Its incorporation involves an incomplete nonribosomal peptide synthetase module and two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, an adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme and an FkbH&#8208;like enzyme for translocation. The mechanism for the direct loading of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids may inspire synthetic biology and antivirulence approaches.







Abstract
Various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) create structural and functional diversity by incorporating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids into peptide backbones. Trigonic acid, an unusual cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid, is the source of the molecular warhead of malleicyprol, a critical virulence factor of human and animal pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group. The process of selecting and loading this building block remained enigmatic as the NRPS module designated for this task is incomplete. Using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, targeted metabolomics, and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that two trans&#8208;acting enzymes are required to load this central building block onto the modular assembly line. An adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme (BurJ) activates trigonic acid, followed by the translocation of the enzyme&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid thioester by an FkbH&#8208;like protein with a mutated phosphatase domain (BurH). This specialized gateway is the first reported direct loading of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid onto a bona fide NRPS module in bacteria and expands the synthetic biology toolbox for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of non&#8208;canonical building blocks. Moreover, insight into the biochemical basis of virulence factor biosynthesis can provide a foundation for developing enzyme inhibitors as anti&#8208;virulence therapeutics against BP pathogen infections.

         <title>Alkene 1,3&#8208;Difluorination via Transient Oxonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a diastereoselective hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers. The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under&#8208;explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.

Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine-mediated 1,3-difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3-difluoro-4-oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3-difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanohoops: A New Generation of Curved Materials for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different nanohoops used to date in organic electronics are described in this Review. Through a structure&#8208;properties relationship study, the different performances reached are analysed and the potential of this new generation of curved materials discussed. This Review aims to stimulate future molecular designs of functional materials based on these conjugated macrocycles.







Abstract
Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems to form a hoop&#8208;shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15&#8197;years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arises from their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as host&#8211;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid&#8208;state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in a fluorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as a host in phosphorescent OLEDs or as charge transporter in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and in organic photovoltaics, this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These findings have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time has now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.

         <title>A Gold(I)&#8211;Acetylene Complex Synthesised using Single&#8208;Crystal Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of &#960;&#8208;acetylene gold(I) compounds as intermediates in catalysis has been postulated, but their isolation or spectroscopic detection has remained elusive. Herein, the combination of a bulky cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine along with single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactivity allowed for the isolation of the first gold(I)&#8211;acetylene complex, which was thoroughly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR, periodic DFT, and electronic structure analyses.







Abstract
Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal solid/gas reactivity the gold(I) acetylene complex [Au(L1)(&#951;2&#8208;HC&#8801;CH)][BArF4] is cleanly synthesized by addition of acetylene gas to single crystals of [Au(L1)(CO)][BArF4] [L1=tris&#8208;2&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbiphenyl)phosphine, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3]. This simplest gold&#8208;alkyne complex has been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and periodic DFT. Bonding of HC&#8801;CH with [Au(L1)]+ comprises both &#963;&#8208;donation and &#960;&#8208;backdonation with additional dispersion interactions within the cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Tune Molecular Orientations to Enable Dual Passivation in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientation, enhancing its interaction with surface defects. Consequently, this led to the successful fabrication of a stable inverted device with an impressive PCE of 25&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nonradiative recombination losses occurring at the interface pose a significant obstacle to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in inverted PSCs. Passivating surface defects using molecules with different functional groups represents one of the key strategies for enhancing PSCs efficiency. However, a lack of insight into the passivation orientation of molecules on the surface is a challenge for rational molecular design. In this study, aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains but identical electron&#8208;donating (&#8722;SH) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8722;NH3+) groups were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientations, which facilitating stronger interactions with the surface defects through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding. The resultant perovskite films following defect passivation demonstrate reduced ion migration, inhibition of nonradiative recombination, and more n&#8208;type characteristics for efficient electron transfer. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% was achieved, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 500&#8197;hours of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Photodetector with High Operational Stability Using Self&#8208;Trapped Cs3Cu2I5 Interfacial Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals transport layer has been embedded in photodiode structures to simultaneously realize bias&#8208;switchable organic photodetectors exhibiting photovoltaic (0&#8197;V) and photomultiplication operating modes (1&#8197;V) with fast response speed, remarkable stability and broad to different organic systems, indicating a versatile strategy for future integrated organic optoelectronic scenarios.







Abstract
Conventional photovoltaic (PV)&#8208;photodetectors are hard to detect fainted signals, while photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;capable devices indispensable for detecting weak light and are prone to degrade under strong light illumination and large bias, and it is urgent to realize highly efficient integrated detecting system with both PM and PV operation modes. In this work, one lead&#8208;free Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals with self&#8208;trapping exciton nature was introduced as interfacial layer adjacent to bulk and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer heterojunction structure, and corresponding organic photodetectors with bias&#8208;switchable dual modes are demonstrated. The fabricated device exhibits low operating bias (0&#8197;V for PV mode and 0.8&#8197;V for PM mode), high specific detectivity (~1013&#8197;Jones), fast response speed as low as 1.59&#8197;&#956;s, large bandwidth over 0.2&#8197;MHz and long&#8208;term operational stability last for 4&#8197;months in ambient condition. This synergy strategy also validated in different materials and device architectures, providing a convenient and scalable production process to develop highly efficient bias&#8208;switchable multi&#8208;functional organic optoelectrical applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomatization of Pyridinium Salts by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;Selective Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4&#8208;selective addition of soft copper&#8208;based silicon nucleophiles to pyridinium triflates allows for their enantioselective deraromatization in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (see scheme; (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE=1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane). The thus&#8208;formed &#945;&#8208;chiral silyl unit can be further used to control the stereoselectivity in subsequent transformations.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective addition of silicon nucleophiles released from an Si&#8722;B reagent to prochiral pyridinium triflates is reported. The dearomatization proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity using Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 as the precatalyst and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE (1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane) as the chiral ligand. A carbonyl group at C3 is required for this, likely acting a weak donor group to preorganize and direct the nucleophilic attack towards C4. The resulting 4&#8208;silylated 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines can be further converted into functionalized piperidine derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;A C4-selective addition of soft copper-based silicon nucleophiles to pyridinium triflates allows for their enantioselective deraromatization in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (see scheme; (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Ph-BPE=1,2-bis[(2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-2,5-diphenylphospholan-1-yl]ethane). The thus-formed &#945;-chiral silyl unit can be further used to control the stereoselectivity in subsequent transformations.

         <title>Sequential Selective Dissolution of Coinage Metals in Recyclable Ionic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au can be sequentially dissolved from waste electrical and electronic equipment using green oxidants: aqueous H2O2 and Oxone in biomass&#8208;derived sustainable and recyclable ionic media: lactic acid and deep eutectic solvent made of choline chloride and urea. This sequential one metal &#8211; one method recycling approach closely follows efforts for the security of supply and objectives of circular economy and sustainable development.







Abstract
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au are essential for modern electronics and their recycling from waste materials is becoming increasingly important to guarantee the security of their supply. Designing new sustainable and selective procedures that would substitute currently used processes is crucial. Here, we describe an unprecedented approach for the sequential dissolution of single metals from Cu, Ag, and Au mixtures using biomass&#8208;derived ionic solvents and green oxidants. First, Cu can be selectively dissolved in the presence of Ag and Au with a choline chloride/urea/H2O2 mixture, followed by the dissolution of Ag in lactic acid/H2O2. Finally, the metallic Au, which is not soluble in either solution above, is dissolved in choline chloride/urea/Oxone. Subsequently, the metals were simply and quantitatively recovered from dissolutions, and the solvents were recycled and reused. The applicability of the developed approach was demonstrated by recovering metals from electronic waste substrates such as printed circuit boards, gold fingers, and solar panels. The dissolution reactions and selectivity were explored with different analytical techniques and DFT calculations. We anticipate our approach will pave a new way for the contemporary and sustainable recycling of multi&#8208;metal waste substrates.

         <title>mRNA Display in Cell Lysates Enables Identification of Cyclic Peptides Targeting the BRD3 Extraterminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>mRNA display is a powerful technology to screen libraries of &gt;1012 cyclic peptides against a protein target, enabling the rapid discovery of high affinity ligands. These cyclic peptides are particularly well suited to challenging protein targets that have been difficult to drug with small molecules. However, target choice can still be limited as screens are typically performed against purified proteins which often demands the use of isolated domains and precludes the use of aggregation&#8208;prone targets. Here, we report a method to perform mRNA display selections in mammalian cell lysates without the need for prior target purification, vastly expanding the potential target scope of mRNA display. We have applied the methodology to identify low to sub&#8208;nanomolar peptide binders for two targets: a NanoLuc subunit (LgBiT) and full&#8208;length bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 3 (BRD3). Our cyclic peptides for BRD3 were found to bind to the extraterminal (ET) domain of BRD3 and the closely related BRD proteins, BRD2 and BRD4. While many chemical probes exist for the bromodomains of BRD proteins, the ET domain is relatively underexplored, making these peptides valuable additions to the BRD toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective cleavage of C &#946; &#8208;O&#8208;4 bond for lignin depolymerization via paired&#8208;electrolysis in an undivided cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8208;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8208;H/N&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage.</dc:description>

         <title>P,N&#8208;Coordinating Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (NYPhos): A Ligand Platform for the Selective Monoarylation of Small Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of small nucleophiles are of great interest, but challenging due to difficulties in selectivity control. Herein, we report the development of a new platform of P,N&#8208;ligands consisting of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines with aminophosphonium groups (NYPhos) to address this challenge. These phosphine ligands are easily accessible in a wide structural diversity with highly modular electronic and steric properties. Based on a family of 14 ligands the selective monoarylation of acetone as well as other challenging ketones and amides was accomplished with record&#8208;setting activities even for aryl chlorides at room temperature including late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug molecules. Moreover, ammonia and other small primary amines could be coupled at mild conditions. Isolation and structure analyses of palladium complexes within the catalytic cycle confirmed the P,N&#8208;coordination mode necessary to reach the observed selectivities and proved the facile adjustability of the N&#8208;donor strength, which is beneficial for the targeted design of tailored P,N&#8208;ligands for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence&#160;and Electroluminescence from Dual&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategy of integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptor in single molecule was proposed to construct white circularly polarized luminescence (WCPL) materials in this work. Consequently, a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers, namely (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ, were designed and synthesized, which displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands in solution and solid films at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.30, 0.33) and (0.33, 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ exhibited high PLQY of up to 67% in doped films and obvious mirror&#8208;image WCPL signals with |glum| value of 3.0 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Moreover, white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) based on organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ as emitters were also achieved with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.37) and EQEmax of 4.7%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level of white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters. By optimizing the device structure, warm WCPEL devices were further obtained with |gEL| value of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8208;3, CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.48) and EQEmax of up to 15.6%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for Efficient and Selective SO2 Capture from CO2&#8208;rich Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture of a low concentration SO2 is of utmost importance as it is responsible for many health and environmental issues. Herein we unveiled two porous organic polymers encompassing a high content of imidazole pockets to interact preferentially with SO2 vs CO2 which can remove trace amount of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams with almost infinite selectivity and high capacity.







Abstract
The quest for effective technologies to reduce SO2 pollution is crucial due to its adverse effects on the environment and human health. Markedly, removing a ppm level of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing waste gas is a persistent challenge, and current technologies suffer from low SO2/CO2 selectivity and energy&#8208;intensive regeneration processes. Here using the molecular building blocks approach and theoretical calculation, we constructed two porous organic polymers (POPs) encompassing pocket&#8208;like structures with exposed imidazole groups, promoting preferential interactions with SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams. Markedly, the evaluated POPs offer outstanding SO2/CO2 selectivity, high SO2 capacity, and an easy regeneration process, making it one of the best materials for SO2 capture. To gain better structural insights into the notable SO2 selectivity of the POPs, we used dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy (DNP) and molecular modelling to probe the interactions between SO2 and POP adsorbents. The newly developed materials are poised to offer an energy&#8208;efficient and environment&#8208;friendly SO2 separation process while we are obliged to use fossil fuels for our energy needs.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Inducible and Photoactivatable Cellular RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines the CRISPR/dCas13b and chemical induced proximity (CIP) techniques to develop a small molecule&#8208;induced photo&#8208;controllable m1A demethylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A) as well as an m1A methylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;m1A). These m1A editing tools are able to regulate the biological function of targeted RNAs by modulating m1A modifications, which in turn influences cell functions.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are promising for drug development due to their good binding properties and the potential to cross membranes. A synthetic strategy and chemical building blocks are developed to produce and screen thousands of small, structurally highly diverse peptidic macrocycles. HTS identifies potent thrombin inhibitors with good membrane permeability. The strategy may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.







Abstract
Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.

Constructing Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 supported intermetallic L10&#8722;PtNi NPs via regulating RMSI between Pt and supports as high&#8208;performing ORR catalysts for PEMFCs







Abstract
Developing efficient and anti&#8208;corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report a novel approach to prepare metal oxides supported intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via the reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) as ORR catalysts, using Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 (Ni/ZrO2) supported L10&#8722;PtNi NPs as a proof of concept. Benefiting from the Ni migration during RMSI, the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the support are increased, leading to an electron enrichment of Pt. The optimal L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI catalyst achieves remarkably low mass activity (MA) loss (17.8&#8201;%) after 400,000 accelerated durability test cycles in a half&#8208;cell and exceptional PEMFC performance (MA=0.76&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=1.52/0.92&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2/&#8722;air, and 18.4&#8201;% MA decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles), representing the best reported Pt&#8208;based ORR catalysts without carbon supports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI requires a lower energetic barrier for ORR than L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2 (direct loading), which is ascribed to a decreased Bader charge transfer between Pt and *OH, and the improved stability of L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI compared to L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;C can be contributed to the increased adhesion energy and Ni vacancy formation energy within the PtNi alloy.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Dynamic Structural Color in a Host&#8208;Guest System for Time&#8208;Dependent Anticounterfeiting and Double&#8208;Lock Encryption</title>

We report a dynamic structural color induced by the difference in the time required for accomplishing the assembly process. This distinctive result opens a door for countless applications in time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and double&#8208;lock encryption.







Abstract
Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting. However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time&#8208;dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption based on a host&#8208;guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid&#8208;crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre&#8208;designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans&#8208;isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time&#8208;dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state's appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host&#8208;guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high&#8208;end applications in information encryption.

         <title>Detection of Sulfoquinovosidase Activity in Cell Lysates Using Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of activity&#8208;based probes targeting the active site nucleophile of glycoside hydrolase family&#8197;31 sulfoquinovosidases is described. The probes are shown to bind covalently by structural biology, mass spectrometry and Cy5 in&#8208;gel fluorescence, are selective for sulfoquinovosidases in whole bacterial cell lysates, and are used to monitor active levels of enzyme over time.







Abstract
The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY&#8208;family&#8197;31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of Bacillus megaterium SQase. A fluorescent Cy5&#8208;probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin&#8208;probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5&#8208;probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT&#8208;qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.

         <title>An All&#8208;Rounder for NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostics: Well&#8208;Tailored 1064&#8201;nm&#8208;Excitable Molecule for Photothermal Combating of Orthotopic Breast Cancer</title>

A 1064&#8197;nm&#8208;laser&#8208;excitable molecule with balanced radiative and non&#8208;radiative decay is fabricated by molecular engineering. Further work validated excellent trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FLI)/NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PAI)/photothermal (PTI) imaging and good NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy (PTT) tumor ablation in orthotopic breast cancer mice models with negligible biotoxicity in vivo.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;activated organic photothermal agent that synchronously enables satisfying NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging is highly warranted yet rather challenging on the basis of the overwhelming nonradiative decay. Herein, such an agent, namely TPABT&#8208;TD, was tactfully designed and constructed via employing benzo[c]thiophene moiety as bulky electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge and tailoring the peripheral molecular rotors. Benefitting from its high electron donor&#8211;acceptor strength and finely modulated intramolecular motion, TPABT&#8208;TD simultaneously exhibits ultralong absorption in NIR&#8208;II region, intense fluorescence emission in the NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) region as nanoaggregates, and high photothermal conversion upon 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Those intrinsic advantages endow TPABT&#8208;TD nanoparticles with prominent fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy against orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor with negligible adverse effect.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;Rich Amines by Aminative Carbofunctionalization of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;rich amines by aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compoundsElectrochemical aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compounds was achieved under mild conditions without stringent exclusion of moisture and air. Complementary to existing photochemical methodologies, this catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive approach involves the coupling of cathodically generated nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radicals with suitable radical acceptors, enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted amines with valuable molecular scaffolds.







Abstract
Alkylamines form the backbone of countless nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules possessing desirable biological properties. Despite advances in amine synthesis through transition metal catalysis and photoredox chemistry, multicomponent reactions that leverage inexpensive materials to transform abundant chemical feedstocks into three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;substituted alkylamines bearing complex substitution patterns remain scarce. Here, we report the design of a catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive manifold that merges amines, carbonyl compounds and carbon&#8208;based radical acceptors under ambient conditions without rigorous exclusion of air and moisture. Key to this aminative carbofunctionalization process is the chemoselective generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radical intermediates that readily couple with electrophilic partners, providing straightforward access to architecturally intricate alkylamines and drug&#8208;like scaffolds which are inaccessible by conventional means.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerobic oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable formyl surrogate derived from biobased feedstocks such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde is achieved over C3N4&#8208;supported single CuN4 sites with 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms and much higher turnover frequency (TOF) than noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cuphen/C3N4 catalysts. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#8901;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#8901;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8722;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#8901;NR1R2 and &#8901;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our catalyst has much higher activity (TOF) than those based on noble metals.

         <title>Delocalizing Excitation for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

The electron&#8208;phonon coupling in organic photovoltaic materials (2FBP&#8208;4F) was reduced through a rational fluoro&#8208;substituted strategy, promoting exciton delocalization. Polaron pairs and polarons were observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles, facilitating the generation of free charge. 2FBP&#8208;4F exhibited high photocatalytic performance in both single&#8208;component and heterojunction systems.







Abstract
Localized excitation in traditional organic photocatalysts typically prevents the generation and extraction of photo&#8208;induced free charge carriers, limiting their activity enhancement under illumination. Here, we enhance delocalized photoexcitation of small molecular photovoltaic catalysts by weakening their electron&#8208;phonon coupling via rational fluoro&#8208;substitution. The optimized 2FBP&#8208;4F catalyst we develop here exhibits a minimized Huang&#8211;Rhys factor of 0.35 in solution, high dielectric constant and strong crystallization in the solid state. As a result, the energy barrier for exciton dissociation is decreased, and more importantly, polarons are unusually observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles (NPs). With the increased hole transfer efficiency and prolonged charge carrier lifetime highly related to enhanced exciton delocalization, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP&#8208;4F heterojunction NPs at varied concentration exhibit much higher optimized photocatalytic activity (207.6&#8211;561.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) for hydrogen evolution than the control PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BP&#8208;4F and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP&#8208;6F NPs, as well as other reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Polyfluorinated Organic Diammonium Induced Lead Iodide Arrangement for Efficient Two&#8208;Step&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are developed by incorporating a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt which cann't generate low&#8208;dimensional perovskites into the lead iodide precursor to change the arrangement of the lead iodide crystals. The resulting high&#8208;quality perovskite film with large grain size boost the efficiencies to 24.70&#8201;% and 21.04&#8201;% for cell (0.06&#8197;cm2) and module (100&#8197;cm2), respectively.







Abstract
The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two&#8208;step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP&#8208;PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP&#8208;PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76&#8201;% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04&#8201;% was achieved in a large&#8208;area perovskite module (100&#8197;cm2). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Caged Rhodamine Generating Nitrosoperoxycarbonate for Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and visible light&#8208;triggered ONOOCO2&#8722; donor (NPCD565) was devised. Its photolysis generated a rhodamine dye along with two mild radicals, e.g., NO and CO2.&#8722;. Their further combination with O2 yields ONOOCO2&#8722;, homolysis of which yields two potent radicals NO2 and CO3.&#8722;, which were harnessed to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. In mouse models, ablation of the primary tumor and suppression of the distant tumor were achieved.







Abstract
Photoimmunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment modality. While potent 1&#8208;e&#8722; oxidative species are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), they are also associated with unspecific oxidation and collateral tissue damage. This difficulty may be addressed by post&#8208;generation radical reinforcement. Namely, non&#8208;oxidative radicals are first generated and subsequently activated into powerful oxidative radicals to induce ICD. Here, we developed a photo&#8208;triggered molecular donor (NPCD565) of nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2&#8722;), the first of its class to our knowledge, and further evaluated its feasibility for immunotherapy. Upon irradiation of NPCD565 by light within a broad spectral region from ultraviolet to red, ONOOCO2&#8722; is released along with a bright rhodamine dye (RD565), whose fluorescence is a reliable and convenient build&#8208;in reporter for the localization, kinetics, and dose of ONOOCO2&#8722; generation. Upon photolysis of NPCD565 in 4T1 cells, damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor&#8208;killing capability of NPCD565 of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO2&#8722;, and its donor (NPCD565) has broad potential for photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Single Crystal and Pentatwinned Gold Nanorods Result in Chiral Nanocrystals with Reverse Handedness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The handedness of chiral gold nanorods synthesized by seeded growth typically follows that of the organic chiral inducer, being right&#8208;handed when templated by S&#8208;BINAMINE micelles or induced by L&#8208;cystine (L&#8208;2cys). Our results demonstrate that a change in the achiral seed, from single crystalline to pentatwinned, can reverse the sign of circular dichroism (CD) measurements, adding a new effect to guide the chirality of gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Handedness is an essential attribute of chiral nanocrystals, having a major influence on their properties. During chemical growth, the handedness of nanocrystals is usually tuned by selecting the corresponding enantiomer of chiral molecules involved in asymmetric growth, often known as chiral inducers. We report that, even using the same chiral inducer enantiomer, the handedness of chiral gold nanocrystals can be reversed by using Au nanorod seeds with either single crystalline or pentatwinned structure. This effect holds for chiral growth induced both by amino acids and by chiral micelles. Although it was challenging to discern the morphological handedness for L&#8208;cystine&#8208;directed particles, even using electron tomography, both cases showed circular dichroism bands of opposite sign, with nearly mirrored chiroptical signatures for chiral micelle&#8208;directed growth, along with quasi&#8208;helical wrinkles of inverted handedness. These results expand the chiral growth toolbox with an effect that might be exploited to yield a host of interesting morphologies with tunable optical properties.

         <title>An Expedient Radical Approach for the Decarboxylative Synthesis of Stereodefined All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;based, photo&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative formation of stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins is reported using various &#945;&#8208;amino radical precursors and heterocycles as substrates. This user&#8208;friendly protocol combines a wide structural scope, easy drug and postsynthetic manipulations, and variation in both reaction partners. The mechanistic studies reveal a key CO2 extrusion step to enable the overall transformation.







Abstract
We report a user&#8208;friendly approach for the decarboxylative formation of stereodefined and complex tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted olefins from vinyl cyclic carbonates and amines as radical precursors. The protocol relies on easy photo&#8208;initiated &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;radical formation followed by addition onto the double bond of the substrate resulting in a sequence involving carbonate ring&#8208;opening, double bond relay, CO2 extrusion and finally O&#8208;protonation. The developed protocol is efficient for both mismatched and matched polarity substrate combinations, and the scope of elaborate stereodefined olefins that can be forged including drug&#8208;functionalized derivatives is wide, diverse and further extendable to other types of heterocyclic and radical precursors. Mechanistic control reactions show that the decarboxylation step is a key driving force towards product formation, with the initial radical addition under steric control.

         <title>Efficient Ultraviolet Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Cerium Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;CPL is proposed by constructing Ce3+&#8208;based 0D chiral HMHs. R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 show large |glum| values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2 and FM values of (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which is superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL active materials. The UV CP light from the fabricated CP&#8208;LEDs can trigger enantioselective photopolymerizations of diacetylene and yield polymerized products with anisotropy factors of CD up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2.







Abstract
Ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (UV&#8208;CPL) with high photon energy shows great potential in polarized light sources and stereoselective photopolymerization. However, developing luminescent materials with high UV&#8208;CPL performance remains challenging. Here, we report a pair of rare earth Ce3+&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7, which exhibits characteristic UV emissions derived from the Ce 5d&#8211;4f transition. The compounds show simultaneously high photoluminescent quantum yields of (32&#8211;39)% and large luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum|) values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2. Thus, the figures of merits of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 are calculated to be (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which are superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL emissive materials. Additionally, nearly 91&#8201;% of their PL intensities at 300&#8197;K can be well preserved at 380&#8197;K (LED operating temperature) without phase transition or decomposition, demonstrating the excellent structural and optical thermal stabilities of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7. Based on these enantiomers, the fabricated UV&#8208;emitting CP&#8208;LEDs exhibit high polarization degrees of &#177;1.0&#8201;%. Notably, the UV&#8208;CPL generated from the devices can significantly trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene with remarkable stereoselectivity, and consequently yield polymerized products with the anisotropy factors of circular dichroism (gCD) up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2, outperforming other UV&#8208;CPL materials and demonstrating their great potential as UV&#8208;polarized light sources.

         <title>Isothermal Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal phase transitions via dynamic covalent chemistry have been unlocked in nematic arrays. A nematic aldehyde was on&#8208;surface treated with various amines, triggering diverse phase transitions driven by imination reactions. The unlocking of these new adaptable liquid crystal systems paves the way for the conception of programmable structural pathways and new materials capable of evolving by chemical stimuli and temperature modulation.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of calamitic liquid crystals is exploited to perform isothermal phase transitions driven by dynamic covalent chemistry. For this purpose, nematic (N) arrays based on aldehyde 1 were treated with different amines (A&#8211;E) in an on&#8208;surface process, which resulted in different isothermal phase transitions. These phase transformations were caused by in situ imination reactions and are dependent on the nature of the added amine. Transitions from the N to crystal (1A, 1E), isotropic (1B), and smectic (Sm) (1C, 1D) phases were achieved, while the resulting materials feature thermotropic liquid crystal behavior. A sequential transformation from the N 1 to the Sm 1C and then to the N 1B was achieved by coupling an imination to a transimination processes and adjusting the temperature. All of these processes were well characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic, and X&#8208;ray techniques, unlocking not only the constitutional but also the structural aspects of the phase transitions. This work provides new insights into designing constitutionally and structurally adaptable liquid crystal systems, paving the way toward the conception of programable evolutive pathways and adaptive materials.

Novel enantiomeric natural indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton were isolated from a mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus. The cytochrome P450 enzyme was identified to catalyze the C2&#8722;C3 double bond cleavage of indole ring to generate products with two keto groups during the biosynthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactam indole terpenoids. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase.







Abstract
(&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes A&#8722;D (1&#8211;4), the first representatives of indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton, were isolated from the mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus Penicillium brocae MA&#8208;231. Our bioactivity tests revealed their potent antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The biosynthetic reactions by the five enzymes PbaABCDE leading to &#947;&#8208;lactam ring formation were identified with heterologous expression and in vitro enzymatic assays. Remarkably, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PbaB and its homolog in Aspergillus oryzae catalyzed the 2,3&#8208;cleavage of the indole ring to generate two keto groups in 1. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase. In addition, rare secondary amide bond formation by the glutamine synthetase&#8208;like enzyme PbaD was reported. These findings will contribute to the engineered biosynthesis of unnatural, bioactive indole terpenoids.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Crystal Structures of Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals through Trace Cadmium(II) Doping for Efficient Color&#8208;Saturated Green LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace Cd2+ doping into FAPbBr3 nanocrystals leads to the increase of exciton effective mass due to the slight perovskite octahedra distortion. Benefiting from enhanced exciton binding energy and almost unchanged Auger recombination rate, a highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% and 534&#8197;nm emission wavelength has been obtained.







Abstract
Decreasing perovskite nanocrystal size increases radiative recombination due to the quantum confinement effect, but also increases the Auger recombination rate which leads to carrier imbalance in the emitting layers of electroluminescent devices. Here, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by increasing the exciton effective mass without affecting the size, which is realized through the trace Cd2+ doping of formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals. We observe an ~2.7&#8197;times increase in the exciton binding energy benefiting from a slight distortion of the [BX6]4&#8722; octahedra caused by doping in the case of that the Auger recombination rate is almost unchanged. As a result, bright color&#8208;saturated green emitting perovskite nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are obtained. Cd2+ doping also shifts up the energy levels of the nanocrystals, relative to the Fermi level so that heavily n&#8208;doped emitters convert into only slightly n&#8208;doped ones; this boosts the charge injection efficiency of the corresponding light&#8208;emitting diodes. The light&#8208;emitting devices based on those nanocrystals reached a high external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% corresponding to a current efficiency of 123&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and showed dramatically improved device lifetime, with a narrow bandwidth of 22&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage coordinates of (0.20, 0.76) for color&#8208;saturated green emission for the electroluminescence peak centered at 534&#8197;nm, thus being fully compliant with the latest standard for wide color gamut displays.

         <title>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery for hydrogen storage and production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for H2 storage and production using Zn as an electron carrier to combine a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery to generate H2 and an alkaline electrolyzer to regenerate Zn. The Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using cheap renewable energy and produce H2 on demand more than 600&#8197;times.







Abstract
Reactive metals hydrolysis offers significant advantages for hydrogen storage and production. However, the regeneration of common reactive metals (e.g., Mg, Al, etc.) is energy&#8208;intensive and produces unwanted byproducts such as CO2 and Cl2. Herein, we employ Zn as a reactive mediator that can be easily regenerated by electrolysis of ZnO in an alkaline solution with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. H2 is produced in the same electrolyte by constructing a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery consisting of a Zn anode and a Raney&#8208;Ni cathode to unlock the Zn&#8208;H2O reaction. The entire two&#8208;step water splitting reaction with a net energy efficiency of 70.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using renewable energy to produce H2 on demand and runs for 600 cycles only sacrificing 3.76&#8201;% energy efficiency. DFT calculations reveal that the desorption of H* on Raney&#8208;Ni (&#8722;0.30&#8197;eV) is closer to zero compared with that on Zn (&#8722;0.87&#8197;eV), indicating a faster desorption of H* at low overpotential. Further, a 24&#8197;Ah electrolyzer is demonstrated to produce H2 with a net energy efficiency of 65.5&#8201;%, which holds promise for its real application.

         <title>Unprecedented POSS&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with 2&#8208;Fold Interpenetrated scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topology of unprecedented POSS&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been revealed to show dependence on the central ions of porphyrin building block. Central metal ions of Co(II) and Zn(II) in porphyrin building block result in the formation of POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with scu topology, while metal free and Ni central ions lead to POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with symmetric sqc topology. The well&#8208;distributed porphyrin units in these COFs endow them with enhanced performance in both photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and photocatalytic production of artemisinin.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated scu or sqc topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO2 reduction and artemisinin synthesis. The porphyrin center serves as an anchor for metal ions, allowing precise control over structures and functions of the frameworks. Furthermore, the metal coordination within the framework imparts desirable catalytic properties, enabling their potential use in photocatalytic reactions. Overall, these porphyrin center regulated metal&#8208;controlled COFs offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced materials with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Ratiometric Afterglow Luminescent Imaging of Matrix Metalloproteinase&#8208;2 Activity via an Energy Diversion Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

An MMP&#8208;2&#8208;activated and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;targeting ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) nanoprobe RAG&#8208;RGD is reported, which is constructed in adoption of energy diversion (ED) of excited&#8208;state afterglow substrate (AG&#8208;8*) and cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process.







Abstract
Ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) probes are attractive for in vivo imaging due to their high sensitivity and signal self&#8208;calibration function. However, there are currently few ratiometric AGL probes available for imaging enzymatic activity in living organisms. Here, we present an energy diversion (ED) strategy that enables the design of an enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric AGL probe (RAG&#8208;RGD) for in vivo afterglow imaging. The ED process provides RAG&#8208;RGD with a radiative transition for an &#8216;always on&#8217; 520&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL520) and a cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process for an &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; 710&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL710) in response to a specific enzyme. Using matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) as an example, RAG&#8208;RGD shows a significant ~11&#8208;fold increase in AGL710/AGL520 toward MMP&#8208;2. This can sensitively detect U87MG brain tumors through ratiometric afterglow imaging of MMP&#8208;2 activity, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep imaging depth. Furthermore, by utilizing the self&#8208;calibration effect of ratiometric imaging, RAG&#8208;RGD demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the AGL710/AGL520 value and the size of orthotopic U87MG tumor, enabling accurate monitoring of orthotopic glioma growth in vivo. This ED process may be applied for the design of other enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric afterglow probes for sensitive afterglow imaging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Inclusion Complexation of Electron&#8208;Accepting Guest into Electron&#8208;Donating Cyclic Host by Photoexcitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene bearing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety exhibited dual locally excited and exciplex emissions from out&#8208;state and in&#8208;state, respectively, in the excited state. The addition of guest molecules suppressed formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state, resulting in observation of the single locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state.







Abstract
Self&#8208;inclusion complexes consisting of host&#8208;guest conjugates are one of the unique supramolecular structures because they form in&#8208;state and out&#8208;state depending on the external stimuli. Despite many reports of the stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;inclusion complex formation, study of the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation has been unexplored. Herein, we report that an electron&#8208;donating host and an electron&#8208;accepting guest conjugate exhibits the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation. Formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state resulted in exciplex emission along with the locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state. Moreover, this structural relaxation by photoexcitation was suppressed not only by temperature, but also by the presence of guest molecules, resulting in changes in the ratio of the dual emission intensities.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Formation of C&#8722;N or C=N Bond during Photocatalytic Reductive Coupling Reaction over CdS Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of C=N and C&#8722;N bonds was facilely achieved by manipulating the solvents via hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated transfer hydrogenation process over CdS photocatalyst.







Abstract
Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds represents a straightforward way to attain imines or secondary amines, but it is difficult to control the product selectivity. Herein, we report the selective formation of C&#8722;N or C=N bond readily manipulated through a solvent&#8208;induced hydrogen bond bridge, facilitating the swift photocatalytic reductive coupling process. The reductive&#8208;coupling of nitro compounds with carbonyl compounds using formic acid and sodium formate as the hydrogen donors over CdS nanosheets selectively generates imines with C=N bonds in acetonitrile solvent; while taking methanol as solvent, the C=N bonds are readily hydrogenated to the C&#8722;N bonds via hydrogen&#8208;bonding activation. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the building of the hydrogen&#8208;bond bridge between the hydroxyl groups in methanol and the N atoms of the C=N motifs in imines facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from CdS surface to the N atoms in imines upon illumination, resulting in the rapid hydrogenation of the C=N bonds to give rise to the secondary amines with C&#8722;N bonds. Our method provides a simple way to control product selectivity by altering the solvents in photocatalytic organic transformations.

Iminium stencil. A cyclometallated imide exhibits a unique mode of action serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines. A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop the most selective and active catalysts described to date for the direct hydrogenation of this challenging class of substrates with up to 99&#8201;% ee and 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF.







Abstract
A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop overall the most selective catalyst for the direct hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl imines described to date. Iridium catalysts with a cyclometallated cyclic imide group provide selectivity of up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Computational studies show that the selectivity results from the combined effect of H&#8208;bonding of the imide C=O with the substrate iminium ion and a stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with the cyclometallated ligand. The cyclometallated ligand thus exhibits a unique mode of action, serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate which results in enhanced selectivity. The catalyst (2) has been synthesized and isolated as a crystalline air&#8208;stable solid. X&#8208;ray analysis of 2 confirmed the structure of the catalyst and the correct position of the imide C=O groups to engage in an H&#8208;bond with the substrate. 19F&#8197;NMR real&#8208;time monitoring showed the hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines catalyzed by 2 is very fast, with a TOF of approx. 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Micelles Cascade Assembly to Tandem Porous Catalyst for Waste Plastics Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle cascade assembly strategy is developed for synthesizing a tandem porous catalyst with hierarchical porous and acidic structures, which mimics natural protease catalytic clefts, exhibiting a high catalytic activity, selectivity and resistance to coking for the catalytic cracking of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) at a low temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic upcycling of polyolefins into high&#8208;value chemicals represents the direction in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization, but poses great challenges. Here, we report the synthesis of a tandem porous catalyst via a micelle cascade assembly strategy for selectively catalytic cracking of polyethylene into olefins at a low temperature. A hierarchically porous silica layer from mesopore to macropore is constructed on the surface of microporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanosheets through cascade assembly of dynamic micelles. The outer macropore arrays can adsorb bulky polyolefins quickly by the capillary and hydrophobic effects, enhancing the diffusion and access to active sites.

&lt;p&gt;A micelle cascade assembly strategy is developed for synthesizing a tandem porous catalyst with hierarchical porous and acidic structures, which mimics natural protease catalytic clefts, exhibiting a high catalytic activity, selectivity and resistance to coking for the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at a low temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic upcycling of polyolefins into high-value chemicals represents the direction in end-of-life plastics valorization, but poses great challenges. Here, we report the synthesis of a tandem porous catalyst via a micelle cascade assembly strategy for selectively catalytic cracking of polyethylene into olefins at a low temperature. A hierarchically porous silica layer from mesopore to macropore is constructed on the surface of microporous ZSM-5 nanosheets through cascade assembly of dynamic micelles. The outer macropore arrays can adsorb bulky polyolefins quickly by the capillary and hydrophobic effects, enhancing the diffusion and access to active sites. The middle mesopores present a nanoconfinement space, pre-cracking polyolefins into intermediates by weak acid sites, which then transport into zeolites micropores for further cracking by strong Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The hierarchically porous and acidic structures, mimicking biomimetic protease catalytic clefts, ideally match the tandem cracking steps of polyolefins, thus suppressing coke formation and facilitating product escape. As a result, light hydrocarbons (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) are produced with a yield of 443&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;ZSM-5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, where 74.3&#8201;% of them are C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; olefins, much superior to ZSM-5 and porous silica catalysts. This tandem porous catalyst exemplifies a superstructure design of catalytic cracking catalysts for industrial and economical upcycling of plastic wastes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with a Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Topology and High Electrical Conductance</title>

A new family of 2D conductive MOFs (named M&#8211;DHHBTN, M=Co, Ni, and Cu) with a unique ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring topology has been successfully constructed by using a highly branched and conjugated dodechydroxyhexabenzotrinaphthylene ligand, which offers the first example simultaneously achieving high electron conductivity and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;pore structure in 2D MOFs.







Abstract
Electrically conducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable structural tunability and outstanding electrical properties. However, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials face challenges due to the limited availability of specific ligands and pore structures. In this study, we have employed a novel highly branched D3h symmetrical planar conjugated ligand, dodechydroxylhexabenzotrinaphthylene (DHHBTN) to fabricate a series of 2D conductive MOFs, named M&#8211;DHHBTN (M=Co, Ni, and Cu). This new family of MOFs offers two distinct types of pores, elevating the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs to a more advanced level. The intricate tessellation patterns of the M&#8211;DHHBTN are elucidated through comprehensive analyses involving powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope. Optical&#8208;pump terahertz&#8208;probe spectroscopic measurements unveiled carrier mobility in DHHBTN&#8208;based 2D MOFs spanning from 0.69 to 3.10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Among M&#8211;DHHBTN famility, Cu&#8208;DHHBTN displayed high electrical conductivity reaching 0.21&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K with thermal activation behavior. This work leverages the &#8220;branched conjugation&#8221; of the ligand to encode heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, underscoring the significant potential of heterogeneous double&#8208;pore structures for future applications.

Single crystals of a functional covalent organic polymer (COP, CityU&#8208;25) containing dative B&#8592;N bonds have been successfully prepared and their structure has been solved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. CityU&#8208;25 as an anode in rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries displayed an excellent performance, evidenced by an impressive capacity of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g.







Abstract
Inspired by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds proven to be the promising dynamic linkage for the construction of crystalline covalent organic polymers/frameworks (COPs/COFs), we employed 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) benzene (BACT) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (DPNTCDI) as the corresponding building blocks to construct a functional COP (named as CityU&#8208;25), which had been employed as an anode in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. CityU&#8208;25 displayed an excellent reversible lithium storage capability of 455&#8197;mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A/g, and an impressive one of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g. These findings suggest that CityU&#8208;25 is a standout candidate for advanced battery technologies, highlighting the potential application of this type of materials.

A novel tandem electrochemical system for converting exhaust NOx into oxime ether is proposed and presents great efficiency over a developed MgO derived from MOF anchoring in nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance of NOx valorization to synthesize organonitrogen drug molecules in a sustainable and mild way.







Abstract
Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ produced NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction coupled with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93&#8201;% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1&#8201;%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97&#8201;% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.

         <title>Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi&#8208;Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red&#8208;shifted Photoswitches in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrines serve as chaperones to solubilize and pre&#8208;order hydrophobic photoswitches with red&#8208;shifted activation wavelength in water, providing unique access to higher reactivity on a molecular scale and quasi&#8208;ideal hydrogel networks without phase segregation on the macroscale.







Abstract
Precision&#8208;engineered light&#8208;triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi&#8208;ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in&#8208;depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo&#8208;mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones.

     alt="Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi-Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red-shifted Photoswitches in Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclodextrines serve as chaperones to solubilize and pre-order hydrophobic photoswitches with red-shifted activation wavelength in water, providing unique access to higher reactivity on a molecular scale and quasi-ideal hydrogel networks without phase segregation on the macroscale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision-engineered light-triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended &#960;-conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 host-guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene-end-functionalized star-shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host-guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi-ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in-depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo-mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones. We submit that our strategy opens avenues for executing hydrophobic photochemistry in aqueous environments with enhanced control over reactivity, hydrogel topology or programmable mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linker Mediated Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Conjugated Organic Polymers Enabling Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable linker engineering strategy is developed to construct a series of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers wrapped onto CNTs (CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) as pyrolysis&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By altering the electronic properties of organic linkers, the optimal CNTs@bTDA&#8208;CoPc&#8208;CPs confers outstanding performance for the ORR and zinc&#8208;air batteries, representing the high performance among reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts to date.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with tailorable composition and microarchitecture are propitious for modulating catalytic properties and deciphering inherent structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we report a facile linker engineering strategy to manipulate the electronic states of metallophthalocyanine conjugated polymers and uncover the vital role of organic linkers in facilitating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, a set of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers (CoPc&#8208;CPs) wrapped onto carbon nanotubes (denoted CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) are judiciously crafted via in situ assembling square&#8208;planar cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)4) with different linear aromatic dialdehyde&#8208;based organic linkers in the presence of CNTs. Intriguingly, upon varying the electronic characteristic of organic linkers from terephthalaldehyde (TA) to 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TDA) and then to thieno/thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxaldehyde (bTDA), their corresponding CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs exhibit gradually improved electrocatalytic ORR performance. More importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer from CoPc units to electron&#8208;withdrawing linkers (i.e., TDA and bTDA) drives the delocalization of Co d&#8208;orbital electrons, thereby downshifting the Co d&#8208;band energy level. Accordingly, the active Co centers with more positive valence state exhibit optimized binding energy toward ORR&#8208;relevant intermediates and thus a balanced adsorption/desorption pathway that endows significant enhancement in electrocatalytic ORR. This work demonstrates a molecular&#8208;level engineering route for rationally designing efficient polymer catalysts and gaining insightful understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms.

         <title>An Integrative Chemical Recycling Approach for Catalytic Oxidation of Epoxy Resin and in situ Separation of Degraded Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.







Abstract
Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on FeIV=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl2 with reaction reagents. As the FeIV=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the FeIV=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high&#8208;value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields via Molecular Symmetry Modulation in Supramolecular Photocatalysts for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the power of symmetry breaking, our supramolecular photocatalyst showcases outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and quantum yield. Our study not only positions SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ among the top performers in organic semiconductor photocatalysts but also demonstrates the method's effectiveness in boosting the efficiency of other catalysts, contributing to the advancement of solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are attractive photocatalysts, but their quantum yields are limited by poor charge separation and transportation. A promising strategy for efficient charge transfer is to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field by symmetry breaking. Herein, an unsymmetric protonation, N&#8208;heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ was developed. The unsymmetric protonation breaks the initial structural symmetry of DADK, resulting in ca. 50&#8208;fold increase in the molecular dipole, and facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer within SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+. The protonation process also creates numerous active sites for H2O adsorption, and serves as crucial proton relays, significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Remarkably, SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ exhibits an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 278.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, placing it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances in organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, the versatility of the unsymmetric protonation approach has been successfully applied to four other photocatalysts, enhancing their photocatalytic performance by 39 to 533&#8197;times. These findings highlight the considerable potential of unsymmetric protonation induced symmetry breaking strategy in tailoring supramolecular photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel production.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamidation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Azides: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic protocol to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under mild conditions. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) pathway in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical.







Abstract
The construction of C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds via direct N&#8208;centered radical addition with olefins under benign conditions is a desirable but challenging strategy. Herein, we describe an organo&#8208;photocatalytic approach to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. A broad range of substrates, including both activated and unactivated alkenes, are suitable for this protocol, providing a convenient and practical method to construct sulfonylamide derivatives. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests that the additive, Hantzsch ester (HE), might undergo a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer manner to achieve photosensitization by the organo&#8208;photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Next, the resulted triplet excited state 3HE* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C4&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, the addition of the amidyl radical to alkene followed by HAT from p&#8208;toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.

&lt;b&gt;HE&lt;/b&gt;* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H-atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, the addition of the amidyl radical to alkene followed by HAT from &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti-Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coral&#8208;Inspired Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Bi&#8208;Stealth Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative coral&#8208;structure inspired multi&#8208;scale composite foam has been successfully fabricated, pioneering the development of terahertz&#8208;infrared bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin. This bi&#8208;stealth system exhibits intelligent electromagnetic protection through autonomous perception, adapting to diverse operational environments and task demands with real&#8208;time responsiveness. Concurrently, it achieves infrared stealth with dynamic ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The development of electronic skin with dual stealth functionality is crucial for enabling devices to operate effectively in dynamic electromagnetic environments, thereby facilitating intelligent electromagnetic protection for autonomous perception. However, achieving compatibility between terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) stealth technologies remains largely unexplored due to their inherent contradictions. Herein, inspired by natural corals, a novel coral&#8208;like multi&#8208;scale composite foam (CMSF) was proposed that ingeniously reconciles these contradictions. The design capitalizes on the conductive network and heat insulation properties of the foam skeleton, the loss effects and low infrared emission of metal particles, and the infrared transparency of magneto&#8208;optical materials. This approach leads to the realization of a THz&#8208;IR bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin concept. The CMSF exhibits a maximum reflection loss of 84.8&#8197;dB in the terahertz band, while its infrared stealth capability ensures environmental adaptability under varying temperatures. Furthermore, the electronic skin exhibits exceptional sensitivity and reliability as a wearable device for perceiving environmental changes. This advanced material, combining multispectral stealth with sensing capabilities, holds immense potential for applications ranging from camouflage technology to smart wearables.

         <title>Desulfurdioxidative N&#8208;N Coupling of N&#8208;Arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;Sulfinylanilines: Reaction Development and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a novel and practical strategy for N&#8722;N bond construction. The strategy involves an unprecedented intermolecular cascade O&#8208;sulfination and desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling (via stepwise retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition, supported by quantum chemistry calculations) from readily available N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines under metal and oxidant free conditions.







Abstract
A highly efficient and chemoselective approach for the divergent assembling of unsymmetrical hydrazines through an unprecedented intermolecular desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling is developed. This metal free protocol employs readily accessible N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines to provide highly valuable hydrazine products with good reaction yields and excellent functional group tolerance under simple conditions. Computational studies suggest that the in situ generated O&#8208;sulfenylated arylhydroxylamine intermediate undergoes a retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition via a stepwise diradical mechanism to form the N&#8722;N bond and release SO2.

         <title>M&#8722;N3 Configuration on Boron Nitride Boosts Singlet Oxygen Generation via Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites have been constructed via a vacancy control and coordination anchoring strategy, which overcome the difficulties in efficient and universal 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), thus achieving impressive selectivity and conversion rate for the transformation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an essential reactive species responsible for selective oxidation of organic matter, especially in Fenton&#8208;like processes. However, due to the great limitations in synthesizing catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites, the controllable production and practical application of 1O2 remain challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical simulations, a series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) were synthesized to regulate 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). All the fabricated BvBN/M catalysts with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites promoted the self&#8208;decomposition of the two PMS molecules to generate 1O2 with high selectivity, where BvBN/Co possessed moderate adsorption energy and d&#8208;band center exhibited superior catalytic activity. As an outcome, the BvBN/Co&#8208;PMS system coupled with membrane filtration technology could continuously transform aromatic alcohols to aldehydes with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and conversion rate under mild conditions, suggesting the potential of this novel catalytic system for green organic synthesis.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Unconventional Phase Alloy Nanobranches for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize unconventional phase Ir&#8208;based alloy nanostrucrtures. Notably, hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi nanobranches demonstrate superior catalytic performance towards ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrite over the conventional phase counterpart. Mechanism studies reveal that Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to the highly selective formation of ammonia.







Abstract
The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one&#8208;pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as&#8208;synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR), with superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2&#8201;% and 34.6&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (75.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1) at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO2RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cascade Dearomatization of Indoles via a Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Bisfunctionalization of Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes has been disclosed. This process delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er).







Abstract
Photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed bisfunctionalization of butadienes with a readily available organic halide and a nucleophile represents an emerging and attractive method to assemble versatile alkenes bearing various functional groups at the allylic position. However, enantiocontrol and/or diastereocontrol in the C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond&#8208;formation step have not been solved due to the open&#8208;shell process. Herein, we present a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoexcited Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes, wherein asymmetric control on both the nucleophile and electrophile part is achieved for the first time in photoinduced bisfunctionalization of butadienes. This method delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Experimental and computational studies of the mechanism have confirmed a radical pathway involving excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. The alignment and non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and the catalyst were found to be essential for stereocontrol.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Enables Flexible&#8208;Robust Porosity for Highly Efficient Purification of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel flexible&#8208;robust HOF material with abundant supramolecular entanglements by weak intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds, enabling the construction of flexible&#8208;robust porosity to be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules for notably improving the C3H8/CH4 and n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 separation performance.







Abstract
The development of porous materials with flexible&#8208;robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a) with flexible&#8208;robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a features a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure with dia topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so&#8208;called flexible&#8208;robust framework). The flexible&#8208;robust porosity of ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules rather by C2H6 and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6 over CH4 under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 selectivities. The gas&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n&#8208;C4H10 can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n&#8208;C4H10 uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6 adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible&#8208;robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.

Valuable formamides were &#8220;pulled out of the hat&#8221; upon reaction of amines with biomass&#8208;based starting materials such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glycolaldehyde and glycerolaldehyde by avoiding any waste products using environmentally benign oxygen as oxidant, as reported by Haijun Jiao, Feng Shi, Jabor Rabeah, Angelika Br&#252;ckner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402241).

Enantiopure irida[6]helicenes combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment are obtained by dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile [4]helicenic ligands. These compounds exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals, as described by Carlos M. Cruz, Fernando P. Coss&#237;o, Zoraida Freixa, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202406663).

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Success of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) triggered prodrug activation relies on two key functions: (1) sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and the intended site of delivery, (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of payload release. Herein, we examine ROS concentrations under various pathophysiological conditions and critically analyze ROS&#8208;triggered prodrug.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.

     alt="The 18F-Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user-friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-difluoromethyl-containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorination. A second approach consists of a &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-difluoromethylation process, which uses &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H radical or [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes, focusing on engineering reaction environments. It discusses strategies for electrocatalyst design, electrode modification, and electrolyte optimization to enhance CO2RR while suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.

Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified triple&#8197;E priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.







Abstract
Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of triple&#8197;E priorities anchored on Environmental, Economic, and Equity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how triple&#8197;E priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products. We summarize by proposing a roadmap for the community aimed at raising awareness, fostering academia&#8211;industry collaboration, and stimulating further advances in sustainable chemical technologies across their broad scope.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazones with internal alkynes is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N atropisomers were synthesized with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, their use in asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with alkynes. A broad range of N&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Secretoglobin 3A2 Covalent Homodimer and Photocaged Monomeric Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a small, secreted protein present only in mammals. Despite its unique self&#8208;assembly driven by disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization, current understanding of its physiology relies solely on in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures. SCGB3A2 chemical synthesis using KAHA ligation now enables access to monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues for studying its self&#8208;assembly behavior.







Abstract
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 belongs to an intriguing family of small, secreted proteins present only in mammals. Although members of the SCGB protein family have distinct amino acid sequences, they share structural similarities. Of particularly interest is the not yet fully understood self&#8208;assembly ability of SCGBs, which arise from covalent disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization. Recently, SCGB3A2 has attracted attention for its singular expression profile in airways. However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. Herein, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi&#8208;milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate the SCGB3A2 self&#8208;assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.

         <title>DOTA&#8208;Based Plectin&#8208;1 Targeted Contrast Agent Enables Detection of Pancreatic Cancer in Human Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest survival rates which is related to the lack of diagnostic tools for early detection. In this study, we developed a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 that significantly improves imaging of PDAC in human tissue and in vivo. These results demonstrate the great potential of the probe to enable early PDAC diagnosis.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy with extremely poor patient survival rates. A key reason for the poor prognosis is the lack of effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at curable, premetastatic stages. Tumor surgical resection is PDAC's first&#8208;line treatment, however distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue with current imaging tools remains a challenge. In this work, we report a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 for imaging PDAC with high specificity. To enable heterogeneous functionalization of the DOTA&#8208;core with multiple targeting peptide units and the fluorophore, a novel, fully clickable synthetic route that proceeds in one pot was developed. Extensive validation of the probe set the stage for PDAC detection in mice and human tissue. Altogether, these findings may pave the way for improved clinical understanding and early detection of PDAC progression as well as more accurate resection criteria.

&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest survival rates which is related to the lack of diagnostic tools for early detection. In this study, we developed a DOTA-based fluorescent probe targeting plectin-1 that significantly improves imaging of PDAC in human tissue and in vivo. These results demonstrate the great potential of the probe to enable early PDAC diagnosis.

The unprecedented ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization with easily accessible sulfonium salts enabled the C&#8722;H arylation of medicinally relevant N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles.







Abstract
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key challenge in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles are important structural motifs with the potential to boost the activity of diverse drug molecules. Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost&#8208;efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective propargylic dehydrogenation is described. Alkynes and allenes are transformed to 1,3&#8208;enynes with moderate Z&#8208;selectivity. Deprotonation is identified as rate&#8208;limiting, and the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect.







Abstract
Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.

         <title>Photogeneration of Chlorine Radical from a Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorous 4CzIPN&#8226;Chloride Complex: Application in C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorous photoredox catalyst 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN (Rf8=C8F17) forms a supramolecular complex with chloride ions with high affinity. Integrating fluorous chains on the parent dye greatly enhances both the ion&#8208;binding affinity, as well as the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Efficient photooxidation of the chloride was observed, generating the chlorine HAT reagent, which was tested in the redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reaction.







Abstract
The chlorine radical is a strong HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) agent that is very useful for the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Albeit highly attractive, its generation from the poorly oxidizable chloride ion mediated by an excited photoredox catalyst is a difficult task. We now report that 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN, an electron&#8208;deficient fluorous derivative of the benchmark 4CzIPN photoredox catalyst belonging to the donor&#8208;acceptor carbazole&#8208;cyanoarene family, is not only a better photooxidant than 4CzIPN, but also becomes an excellent host for the chloride ion. Combining these two properties ultimately makes the self&#8208;assembled 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN&#8226;Cl&#8722; dual catalyst highly reactive in redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reactions promoted by the chlorine radical. Additionally, because of its fluorous character, the efficient separation/recovery of 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN could be envisioned.

         <title>The CF3 Group as a Synthon of the CF+ Unit in Palladium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

Pulling fluorine off: The unusually high activity of the C&#8722;F bond found in the homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; is correlated to the very low fluoride&#8208;ion affinity of the conjugate difluorocarbene complex [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722;, which is experimentally detected. Selective single, double or triple defluorination of a CF3 group is achieved under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.

Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd(CNR)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with secondary amines R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH proceeds with loss of just two F-substituents, whereby the Fischer-type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd(CFNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with diamines affords different [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd(NHC)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complexes containing sterically non-demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin-2-ylidene or benzimidazolin-2-ylidene rings as well as the expanded-ring perimidin-2-ylidene. This metal-tailored synthetic route, where a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group acts as a pre-carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC-chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non-isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd(CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is experimentally detected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Sensor Based on Steric Hindrance Regulated Molecular Packing for In Vivo Epilepsy Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescence sensing mechanism is presented by using steric hindrance quenchers to regulate the molecular packing state of fluorophores. The ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice brain is visualized by the SHINE sensor.







Abstract
Fluorescence sensing is crucial to studying biological processes and diagnosing diseases, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window with reduced background signals. However, it's still a great challenge to construct &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensors when the sensing wavelength extends into the NIR&#8208;II region to obtain higher imaging contrast, mainly due to the difficult synthesis of spectral overlapped quencher. Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quencher (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQs can competitively pack with fluorophores and prevent their self&#8208;aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensing method is achieved via bio&#8208;analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely the Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy. As a proof of concept, the ClO&#8722;&#8208;sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR&#8208;II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real&#8208;time visualization of ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice.

         <title>Umbrella&#8208;Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally multi&#8208;alkylated aromatic micelles are assembled in water from umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles featuring a linear alkyl chain flanked by two polyaromatic panels. The alkylation strongly enhances the stability of the novel micelles against dilution and heat. Notably, thanks to the softness of the fully alkyl&#8208;filled cavity, efficient uptake of large metallodyes and pseudorotaxane&#8208;like binding of cycloparaphenylenes is achieved.







Abstract
To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8211;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups). The amphiphiles quantitatively assemble into spherical micelles (~2&#8211;3&#8197;nm in core diameter), possessing an alkylated cavity surrounded by a polyaromatic framework, in water. The alkylation significantly enhances the stability of the micellar structures against dilution (up to 9&#8197;&#956;M) and heat (up to &gt;120&#8201;&#176;C). The highly condensed hexadecyl core of the hybrid micelle, as indicated by solvatochromic guest probes, displays increased uptake ability toward large alkylated metallodyes. Interestingly, efficient uptake of aromatic macrocycles (i.e., [n]cycloparaphenylenes) by the present micelle provides pseudorotaxane&#8208;shaped host&#8211;guest composites with high emissivity (&#934;F=up to 35&#8201;%). Internal multi&#8208;alkylation of an aromatic micelle can thus successfully enhance its assembly stability/guest uptake functions.

         <title>Organometallic Chirality Sensing via &#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;Like &#951;6&#8208;Arene Coordination with an Achiral Cp*Ru(II) Piano Stool Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with a readily available ruthenium piano stool complex and its use in an optical CD/UV relay assay allow time&#8208;efficient chromatography&#8208;free stereochemical analysis of a broad range of challenging molecules.







Abstract
Piano stool complexes have been studied over many years and found widespread applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, materials and drug development. We now report the first examples of quantitative chiroptical molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with readily available half sandwich complexes. This conceptually new approach to chirality sensing is based on irreversible acetonitrile displacement of [Cp*Ru(CH3CN)3]PF6 by an aromatic target molecule, a process that is fast and complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The metal coordination coincides with characteristic circular dichroism inductions that can be easily correlated to the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio of the bound molecule. A relay assay that decouples the determination of the enantiomeric composition and of the total sample amount by a practical CD/UV measurement protocol was developed and successfully tested. The introduction of piano stool complexes to the chiroptical sensing realm is mechanistically unique and extends the scope of currently known methods with small&#8208;molecule probes that require the presence of amino, alcohol, carboxylate or other privileged functional groups for binding of the target compound. A broad application range including pharmaceutically relevant multifunctional molecules and the use in chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis are also demonstrated.

         <title>Linkage Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic C2H4 Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are constructed by linkage engineering to efficiently catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalytic array structure composed of sp3 N sites in the aminal linkages promotes CO2 capture and enhances the reaction kinetics for C2H4 production, thus showing a much higher Faraday efficiency of C2H4 than imine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1&#8201;%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.

In addition, a series of imine-linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Blocking Interfacial Proton Transport via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for HER&#8208;free zinc anodes by anchoring ionic liquid (BMIM+) cations on Ti3C2Tx (MXene) substrate. The BMIM+ with a high coordination number of water molecules can significantly reduce the interfacial densities of H2O molecules. Therefore, the SAM can disrupt the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and hinder proton transport at the interface, suppressing HER.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, yet suffer from the issues of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and intricate side reactions on the Zn anode surface. The hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond networks play a critical role in interfacial proton transport that may closely relate to HER but are rarely investigated. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy which is constructed by anchoring ionic liquid cations on Ti3C2Tx substrate for HER&#8208;free Zn anode. Molecule dynamics simulations reveal that the rationally designed SAM with a high coordination number of water molecules (25&#8211;27, 4&#8211;6 for Zn2+) largely reduces the interfacial densities of H2O molecules, therefore breaking the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and blocking proton transport on the interface, by which the HER is suppressed. Then, a series of in situ characterizations demonstrate that negligible amounts of H2 gas are collected from the Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene anode. Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long&#8208;cycling life of 3000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high&#8208;capacity retention of over 94&#8201;% after 1000 cycles and large&#8208;area (10&#215;5&#8197;cm2) pouch cells with desired performance.

         <title>Expedient Access to 18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes via Deaminative Radiofluorination of Aniline&#8208;Derived Pyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes find wide application as radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Here, we present a deaminative radiosynthetic approach via pyridinium tetrafluoroborates that facilitates radiofluorination of 33 structurally diverse heteroarenes in up to 98&#8201;% RCY (radiochemical yield). This method was also amenable to automation and was successfully translated to an automated synthesiser.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that pyridinium salts derived from abundant (hetero)anilines represent a novel precursor class for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with [18F]fluoride. The value of this new 18F&#8208;fluorodeamination is demonstrated with the synthesis of over 30 structurally diverse and complex heteroaryl 18F&#8208;fluorides, several derived from scaffolds that were yet to be labelled with fluorine&#8208;18. The protocol tolerates heteroarenes and functionalities commonly found in drug discovery libraries, and is amenable to scale&#8208;up and automation on a commercial radiosynthesiser.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Selective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyridines and Isoquinolines through Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated pyridines are prepared via bench stable oxazino pyridine intermediates with unsymmetrical iodonium salts using Cu&#8208;catalysis. The strategy can be applied for meta&#8208;alkenylation upon simply switching to the corresponding alkenyl I(III) reagents and both C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalizations also work on isoquinolines.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization offers an efficient strategy for the synthesis of various elaborated N&#8208;containing heteroarenes. Along these lines, oxazino pyridines that can be readily prepared from pyridines, have been introduced as powerful substrates in radical&#8208; and ionic&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. However, the regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines remains a great challenge. Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines and isoquinolines through bench&#8208;stable dearomatized intermediates is reported. Electrophilic aryl&#8208;Cu(III) species, generated from readily accessible aryl I(III) reagents, enable the efficient meta&#8208;arylation of a broad range of pyridines and isoquinolines. The method also allows the meta&#8208;selective alkenylation of these heteroarenes using the corresponding alkenyl I(III)&#8208;reagents. Late&#8208;stage arylation of drug&#8208;derived pyridines and larger&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>One&#8208;Component Cationic Lipids for Systemic mRNA Delivery to Splenic T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that predominantly target the liver and possess complex constituents, we designed simplified one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipid/mRNA nanoparticles (CLNs) for extrahepatic mRNA delivery. These CLNs facilitated mRNA expression in the spleen and T cells, demonstrating substantial potential for immunotherapy applications.







Abstract
Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non&#8208;liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine&#8208;based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications. This straightforward strategy extends the utility of lipid family for extrahepatic mRNA delivery, offering new insights into vector development beyond LNPs to further the field of precise mRNA therapy.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Boosted Hydronium Intercalation: A Paradigm Shift in Aluminum&#8208;Based Batteries</title>

The &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets are rich in oxygen defects, which tilt the adsorption effect of Al3+ and effectively inhibit further insertion/diffusion of Al3+. This phenomenon leaves space for H3O+ insertion, allowing it to insert into the lattice smoothly.







Abstract
In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydronium ions (H3O+) may offer the solution. However, the presence of considerable Al3+ in the electrolyte hinders the insertion reaction of H3O+. Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H3O+ insertion in mild electrolytes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization&#8208;responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation&#8208;responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Enantiopure [6]&#8208;Azairidahelicene by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of a Configurationally Labile [4]&#8208;Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes, combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment, are readily accessible by an effective dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand. The two isolated enantiomers exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals.







Abstract
A pair of enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand (4&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;benzo[g]phenanthrene, L1H) using bis&#8208;cyclometalated chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |gphos| values of 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3.
