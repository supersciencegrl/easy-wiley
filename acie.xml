         <dc:description>A water&#8208;soluble trianionic heteroleptic copper(I) photosensitizer having four sulfonate groups (CuPS3&#8722;) was found to afford the 1:2 ion&#8208;pair adduct with dicationic alkylammonium (hexamethonium) cations (HM2+) in aqueous media, leading to exhibit excellent photophysical and photocatalytic performances owing to the substantial suppression of water&#8208;derived non&#8208;radiative decay of the photoexcited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) have been showing considerable potentials in bio&#8208;applications thanks to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the over&#8208;narrow bandgaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and photo&#8208;therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, show a much broadened direct bandgap of 1.65 eV, which enables the materials to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, the H&#8208;germanene nanosheets demonstrate substantially enlarged bandgap and favorable biodegradability, manifesting a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for tumor catalytic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Springtail&#8208;inspired Light&#8208;driven Soft Jumping Robots Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Monolithic Three&#8208;leaf Panel Fold Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Jump is an important form of motion that enables animals to escape from predators, increase their range of activities, and better adapt to the environment. Inspired by springtails, we describe a light&#8208;driven soft jumping robot based on a double&#8208;folded liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) ribbon actuator with a monolithic three&#8208;leaf panel fold structure. This robot can achieve remarkable jumping height, jumping distance, and maximum take&#8208;off velocity, of up to 87 body length (BL), 65 BL, and 930 BL/s, respectively, under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Further, it is possible to control the height, distance, and direction of jump by changing the size and crease angle of the double&#8208;folded LCE ribbon actuators. These robots can efficiently jump over obstacles and can jump continuously, even in complex environments. Our simple design strategy improves the performance of jumping actuators and we expect it to have a wide&#8208;ranging impact on the strength, continuity, and adaptability of future soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Guanidine Additive Enabled Intermolecular ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde&#8208;Amine&#8208;Thiol Three&#8208;Component Reactions for Modular Constructions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) is gaining a renascence for modifying proteins and peptides, via OPA&#8208;amine two&#8208;component reactions for bioconjugation and intramolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reactions for cyclization. Historically, small thiol molecules were used in large excess to allow for the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol reaction forming 1&#8208;thio&#8208;isoindole derivatives. In this report, we discovered that guanidine could serve as an effective additive to switch the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction to a stoichiometric process and enable the modular construction of peptide&#8208;peptide, and peptide&#8208;drug conjugate structures. Thus, twelve model peptide&#8208;peptide conjugates have been synthesized from unprotected peptides featuring all proteinogenic residues. Besides, six peptide&#8208;drug conjugates have been prepared in one step, with excellent conversions and isolated yields. In addition, a conjugate product has been further functionalized by utilizing the pre&#8208;modified OPA derivative, demonstrating the versatility and flexibility of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultramicroporous Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with Functionality Pair for Membrane C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas separation efficiency of covalent organic framework (COF) membrane can be greatly elevated through precise functionalization. A pair&#8208;functionalized COF membrane of 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and isoquinoline&#8208;5,8&#8208;diamine (IQD) monomers in two and three nodes is designed and synthesized. TP&#8208;IQD is crystallized in a two&#8208;dimensional structure with a pore size of 6.5 &#197; and a surface area of 289 m2 g&#8208;1. This COF possesses N&#8208;O paired groups which cooperatively interact with C2H2 instead of C2H4. TP&#8208;IQD nanosheets of ~10 &#181;m in width and ~4 nm in thickness are prepared by mechanical exfoliation; they are further processed with 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer into a hybrid membrane. High porosity and functionality pair of TP&#8208;IQD offer the membrane with significantly increased C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity which are 160% and 430% higher of pure 6FDA&#8208;ODA. The boosted performance demonstrates high efficiency of the pair&#8208;functionality strategy for the synthesis of separation&#8208;led COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Dual Electrolyte Additive Sustains Zn Metal Anode with 5600 h Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite conspicuous merits of Zn metal anodes, the commercialization is still handicapped by rampant dendrite formation and notorious side reaction. Manipulating the nucleation mode and deposition orientation of Zn is a key to rendering stabilized Zn anodes. Here, a dual electrolyte additive strategy is put forward via the direct cooperation of xylitol (XY) and graphene oxide (GO) species into typical zinc sulfate electrolyte. As verified by molecular dynamics simulations, the incorporated XY molecules could regulate the solvation structure of Zn2+, thus inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. The self&#8208;assembled GO layer is in favor of facilitating the desolvation process to accelerate reaction kinetics. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be realized under the synergistic modulation, enabling a dense and uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetric cell based on dual additives harvests a highly reversible cycling of 5600 h at 1.0 mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging Identifies Functional Macromolecules by Using Microdroplet&#8208;Cleavable Mass Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present immunoassay&#8208;based desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (immuno&#8208;DESI&#8208;MSI) to visualize functional macromolecules such as drug targets and cascade signaling factors. A set of boronic acid mass tags (BMTs) were synthesized to label antibodies as MSI probes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present immunoassay-based desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (immuno-DESI-MSI) to visualize functional macromolecules such as drug targets and cascade signaling factors. A set of boronic acid mass tags (BMTs) were synthesized to label antibodies as MSI probes. The boronic ester bond is employed to cross-link the BMT with the galactosamine-modified antibody. The BMT can be released from its tethered antibody by ultrafast cleavage of the boronic ester bond caused by the acidic condition of sprayed DESI microdroplets containing water.

         <title>Integrating Chemical Pre&#8208;Potassiation with Pre&#8208;Modulated KF&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Interfaces for Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium Ion Hybrid Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a chemical pre&#8208;potassiation strategy via simultaneously treating both glucose derived carbon (GDC) anode and commercial activated carbon (CAC) cathode in potassium&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;tetrahydrofuran solution is developed for potassium ion hybrid capacitor (PIHC). Combined with in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations, a radical reaction between pre&#8208;potassiation reagent and carbon electrodes is confirmed, which not only deactivates electrochemical irreversible sites, but also promotes to pre&#8208;form a uniform and dense KF&#8208;rich electrolyte film on the electrodes. As a result, the pre&#8208;potassiation treatment presents multiple advantages: (I) the initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the GDC anode increases from 45.4% to 84.0% with higher rate capability; (II) the CAC cathode exhibits the improved cycling CEs and stability due to the enhanced resistance to electrolyte oxidation at 4.2 V; (III) the assembled PIHC achieves a high energy density of 172.5 Wh kg&#8208;1 with cycling life over 10000 cycles.</dc:description>

For CZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B, reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) is mediated through the vibronic coupling of two charge transfer (CT) states, without involving the triplet local excited state (3LE), resulting in remarkable rISC rate invariance to environmental polarity and polarisability whilst giving high organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) efficiency.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activated carbon catalyst having weak acid sites hydrolyzes chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides selectively in the presence of mechanical milling. Our system preferentially cleaves large molecules over small oligomers, thus maximizing the selectivity and yield of chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides. The product mixture is a promising plant biostimulant for environmentally friendly agriculture.







Abstract
Oligosaccharides possess fascinating functions that are applicable in a variety of fields, such as agriculture. However, the selective synthesis of oligosaccharides, especially chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides, has remained a challenge. Chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides activate the plant immune system, enabling crops to withstand pathogens without harmful agrichemicals. Here, we demonstrate the conversion of chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides using a carbon catalyst with weak acid sites and mechanical milling. The catalyst produces chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity in good yields. Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations indicate that our system preferentially hydrolyzes larger chitin molecules over oligomers, thus providing the desired high selectivity. This unique kinetics is in contrast to the fact that typical catalytic systems rapidly hydrolyze oligomers to monomers. Unlike other materials carbons more strongly adsorb large polysaccharides than small oligomers, which is suitable for the selective synthesis of small oligosaccharides.

         <title>Decorating Single&#8208;Atomic Mn Sites with FeMn Clusters to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexisting single&#8208;atomic Mn and FeMn atomic clusters sites have been fabricated by the innovative combination of post&#8208;adsorption and secondary pyrolysis approach. This material has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O2 and the cleavage of O&#8722;O bond during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, thus improving the intrinsic ORR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The regulation of electron distribution of single&#8208;atomic metal sites by atomic clusters is an effective strategy to boost their intrinsic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein we report the construction of single&#8208;atomic Mn sites decorated with atomic clusters by an innovative combination of post&#8208;adsorption and secondary pyrolysis. The X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of Mn sites via Mn&#8208;N4 coordination bonding to FeMn atomic clusters (FeMnac/Mn&#8208;N4C), which has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O2 and the break of O&#8722;O bond during the ORR process. Benefiting from the structural features above, the FeMnac/Mn&#8208;N4C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.79&#8197;V in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 0.90&#8197;V in 0.1&#8197;M KOH as well as preeminent Zn&#8208;air battery performance. Such synthetic strategy may open up a route to construct highly active catalysts with tunable atomic structures for diverse applications.

         <title>A Dynamic Supramolecular H&#8208;bonding Network with Orthogonally Tunable Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic synergy strategy provides a novel example of supramolecular dual&#8208;tunable clusteroluminescence. The unique &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation endows materials with efficient luminescence as well as mechanical adaptivity and robustness. Moreover, dual dynamic polymeric networks provide an ideal platform for the orthogonal regulation of clusteroluminescence and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Enabling dynamically tunable emissive systems offers opportunities for constructing smart materials. Clusteroluminescence, as unconventional luminescence, has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental and applied sciences. Herein, we report a supramolecular poly(disulfides) network with tunable clusteroluminescence. The reticular H&#8208;bonds synergize the rigidity and mobility of dynamic networks, and endow the resulting materials with mechanical adaptivity and robustness, simultaneously enabling efficient clusteroluminescence and phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. Orthogonally tunable luminescence are achieved in two manners, i.e., slow backbone disulfide exchange and fast side&#8208;chain metal coordination. Further exploration of the reprocessability and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of intrinsic dynamic networks for sustainable materials is feasible. We foresee that the synergistic strategy of dynamic chemistry offers a novel pathway and potential opportunities for smart emissive materials.

         <title>A Ferroelectric Aminophosphonium Cyanoferrate with a Large Electrostrictive Coefficient as a Piezoelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>

A ferroelectric Iron (III) cyanometallate complex stabilized by organo&#8208;aminophosphonium cations was synthesized and utilized for efficient piezoelectric energy harvesting and storage applications.







Abstract
Hybrid materials possessing piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric properties emerge as excellent alternatives to conventional piezoceramics due to their merits of facile synthesis, lightweight nature, ease of fabrication and mechanical flexibility. Inspired by the structural stability of aminophosphonium compounds, here we report the first A3BX6 type cyanometallate [Ph2(iPrNH)2P]3[Fe(CN)6] (1), which shows a ferroelectric saturation polarization (Ps) of 3.71&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Compound 1 exhibits a high electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.73&#8197;m4&#8197;C&#8722;2, far exceeding those of piezoceramics (0.034&#8211;0.096&#8197;m4&#8197;C&#8722;2). Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis demonstrates the polarization switching and domain structure of 1 further confirming its ferroelectric nature. Furthermore, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer composite films of 1 were prepared and employed as piezoelectric nanogenerators. Notably, the 15&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1&#8208;TPU device gave a maximum output voltage of 13.57&#8197;V and a power density of 6.03&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Carbonitratation Reaction Featuring an H&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Driven Alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd0&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonitratation reaction between (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,6&#8208;diene and AgNO3 has been developed with the use of [PyH][BF4] as H&#8208;bonding donor under the toluene/H2O biphasic conditions, which provides a complementary method towards alkyl nitrates with high enantioselectivity. Experimental studies suggest a reaction mechanism involving an H&#8208;bonding&#8208;driven SN2&#8208;type alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 reductive elimination.







Abstract
Reductive elimination of alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;O is a synthetically useful yet underdeveloped elementary reaction. Here we report that the combination of an H&#8208;bonding donor [PyH][BF4] and AgNO3 additive under toluene/H2O biphasic system can enable such elementary step to form alkyl nitrate. This results in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonitratations of (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,6&#8208;dienes with (R)&#8208;BINAP as the chiral ligand, affording alkyl nitrates up to 96&#8201;% ee. Mechanistic studies disclose that the reaction consists of oxidative addition of Pd0 catalyst to vinyl iodide, anion ligand exchange between I&#8722; and NO3&#8722;, alkene insertion and SN2&#8208;type alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 reductive elimination. Evidences suggest that H&#8208;bonding interaction of PyH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;ONO2 can facilitate dissociation of O2NO&#8722; ligand from the alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 species, thus enabling the challenging alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 reductive elimination to be feasible.

         <title>The Role of Cytochrome&#8197;P450 AbyV in the Final Stages of Abyssomicin&#8197;C Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme AbyV catalyses a key epoxidation in the final stages of the biosynthesis of the spirotetronate antibiotic abyssomicin&#8197;C. Combining structural and computational data with a 13C labelling strategy was found to be a powerful approach to interrogate the biotransformation and determine the precise function of the enzyme.







Abstract
Abyssomicin&#8197;C and its atropisomer are potent inhibitors of bacterial folate metabolism. They possess complex polycyclic structures, and their biosynthesis has been shown to involve several unusual enzymatic transformations. Using a combination of synthesis and in vitro assays we reveal that AbyV, a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme from the aby gene cluster, catalyses a key late&#8208;stage epoxidation required for the installation of the characteristic ether&#8208;bridged core of abyssomicin&#8197;C. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of AbyV has been determined, which in combination with molecular dynamics simulations provides a structural framework for our functional data. This work demonstrates the power of combining selective carbon&#8208;13 labelling with NMR spectroscopy as a sensitive tool to interrogate enzyme&#8208;catalysed reactions in vitro with no need for purification.

         <title>Taming Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters via Remote H&#8208;Bonding Stereoinduction in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropenes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were reported. Various chiral five&#8208;membered oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;heterocycles were produced, and good yields and high stereoselectivities were obtained. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through H&#8208;bonding from chiral ligands.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening transformations of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes enable the rapid assembly of complex molecules. However, the enantioselective formation of chiral quaternary stereocenters using substrates bearing two different acceptors remains a challenge. Herein, we describe the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition of vinyl cyclopropanes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, a subset of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through hydrogen bond from chiral ligands, which thereby addressed the aforementioned challenge. A variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocycles were produced in good yields and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yields, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er and &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and theoretical calculations, revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity and the importance of H&#8208;bonding in stereocontrol.

         <title>Heterogenization of Salen Metal Molecular Catalysts in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is reported. Co/Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is superior to the previously reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based COF photocatalysts







Abstract
Integrating a molecular catalyst with a light harvester into a photocatalyst is an effective strategy for solar light conversion. However, it is challenging to establish a crystallized framework with well&#8208;organized connections that favour charge separation and transfer. Herein, we report the heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The chemically conjugated bonds between the two units contribute to fast photogenerated electron transfer and thereby promote the proton reduction reaction. The Salen cobalt&#8208;based COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is superior to the previously reported nonnoble metal based COF photocatalysts. This work provides a strategy to construct atom&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by the heterogenization of molecular catalysts into covalent organic frameworks.

         <title>Chemoselective Decarboxylative Protonation Enabled by Cooperative Earth&#8208;Abundant Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining simple iron and thiol catalysts allows carboxylic acids to be directly converted to C&#8722;H bonds under visible light irradiation. The cocatalytic system exhibits a wide scope, is scalable, and preliminary mechanistic studies suggest it functions via a tandem ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mechanism.







Abstract
Decarboxylative protonation is a general deletion tactic to replace polar carboxylic acid groups with hydrogen or its isotope. Current methods rely on the pre&#8208;activation of acids, non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen sources, and/or expensive/highly oxidizing photocatalysts, presenting challenges to their wide adoption. Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d&#8208;incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE=1) are consistent with a light&#8208;limited reaction.

         <title>Enriching Surface&#8208;Accessible CO2 in the Zero&#8208;Gap Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor called the surface&#8208;accessible CO2 concentration ([CO2]SA) is developed, which enables to indicate the transient state of the local [CO2]/[OH&#8722;] ratio and helps define the limits of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Three general tactics are developed to enrich [CO2]SA for high current electrolysis: (1)&#8197;increasing the catalyst layer thickness, (2)&#8197;elevating CO2 pressure, and (3)&#8197;employing the pulse electrochemical method.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;gap anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based CO2 electrolysis is a promising technology for CO production, however, their performance at elevated current densities still suffers from the low local CO2 concentration due to heavy CO2 neutralization. Herein, via modulating the CO2 feed mode and quantitative analyzing CO2 utilization with the aid of mass transport modeling, we develop a descriptor denoted as the surface&#8208;accessible CO2 concentration ([CO2]SA), which enables us to indicate the transient state of the local [CO2]/[OH&#8722;] ratio and helps define the limits of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To enrich the [CO2]SA, we developed three general strategies: (1)&#8197;increasing catalyst layer thickness, (2)&#8197;elevating CO2 pressure, and (3)&#8197;applying a pulsed electrochemical (PE) method. Notably, an optimized PE method allows to keep the [CO2]SA at a high level by utilizing the dynamic balance period of CO2 neutralization. A maximum jCO of 368&#177;28&#8197;mA&#8201;cmgeo&#8722;2 was achieved using a commercial silver catalyst.

         <title>Structurally Defined Water&#8208;Soluble Metallofullerene Derivatives towards Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular metallobuckytrio (MBT) platform provides a family of structurally defined, water&#8208;soluble metallofullerene derivatives that can safely carry rare&#8208;earth elements in tailorable molecules, showing promise in biomedicines including MRI contrast agents and photosensitizers.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) are excellent carriers of rare&#8208;earth element (REE) ions in biomedical applications because they preclude the release of toxic metal ions. However, existing approaches to synthesize water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives yield mixtures that inhibit precise drug design. Here we report the synthesis of metallobuckytrio (MBT), a three&#8208;buckyball system, as a modular platform to develop structurally defined water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives with ligands by choice. Demonstrated with PEG ligands, the resulting water&#8208;soluble MBTs show superb biocompatibility. The Gd MBTs exhibit superior T1 relaxivity than typical Gd complexes, potentially superseding current clinical MRI contrast agents in both safety and efficiency. The Lu MBTs generated reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation, showing promise as photosensitizers. With their modular nature to incorporate other ligands, we anticipate the MBT platform to open new paths towards bio&#8208;specific REE drugs.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;solid Zinc Powder&#8208;based Slurry Anode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and the intrinsically zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Experimental observations and theoretical simulations reveal that zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc stripping/plating.

The booming of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) draws the researchers&#8217; attention to issues of zinc metal anodes, such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, corrosion, and volume effects. Zinc powder anode is more suitable for the industrial application of AZIBs than the widely used zinc foil anode due to its low cost, tunability and processability. However, the related solutions are rarely studied because the above issues of zinc metal anode are more serious in zinc powder anode. Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc stripping/plating. Moreover, the practical application of the full cell with slurry is very promising since its operating life can be easily extended by facile slurry renewal.

         <title>NaCdSb: An Orthorhombic Zintl Phase with Exceptional Intrinsic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance Zintl phase thermoelectric material NaCdSb has a peak figure of merit zT=1.3 at 673&#8197;K without any doping optimization or structural modification. This compound exhibits intrinsic semiconductor behavior, and the hole concentration approaches optimal as the temperature rises, leading to high power factors. The ultralow thermal conductivity is achieved through the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds.







Abstract
Many Zintl phases are promising thermoelectric materials owning to their features like narrow band gaps, multiband behaviors, ideal charge transport tunnels, and loosely bound cations. Herein we show a new Zintl phase NaCdSb with exceptional intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Pristine NaCdSb exhibits semiconductor behaviors with an experimental hole concentration of 2.9&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 and a calculated band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV. As the temperature increases, the hole concentration rises gradually and approaches its optimal one, leading to a high power factor of 11.56&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. The ultralow thermal conductivity is derived from the small phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime, ascribed to the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds. As a consequence, a maximum zT of 1.3 at 673&#8197;K has been achieved without any doping optimization or structural modification, demonstrating that NaCdSb is a remarkable thermoelectric compound with great potential for performance improvement.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydrophosphinylation of Alkynes: Facile Access to Axially Chiral Styrene&#8208;Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a newly developed Cu/CPA co&#8208;catalytic system, the direct hydrophosphinylation of alkynes with nucleophilic phosphine oxides was achieved to access novel axially chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing alkenes in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction pathway and the enantiocontrol model.







Abstract
A Cu/CPA co&#8208;catalytic system has been developed for achieving the direct hydrophosphinylation of alkynes with phosphine oxides in delivering novel axially chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing alkenes in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction pathway and the origin of enantiocontrol. This streamlined and modular methodology establishes a new platform for the design and application of new axially chiral styrene&#8208;phosphine ligands.

         <title>Maximum Impact of Ionic Strength on Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Rates Induced by a Zeolite Microporous Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined hydronium ions in zeolite create an intraporous ionic environment, which increases acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction rates in a volcanic pattern at both saturated and low concentrations of substrates in the pores.







Abstract
The intracrystalline ionic environment in microporous zeolite can remarkably modify the excess chemical potential of adsorbed reactants and transition states, thereby influencing the catalytic turnover rates. However, a limit of the rate enhancement for aqueous&#8208;phase dehydration of alcohols appears to exist for zeolites with high ionic strength. The origin of such limitation has been hypothesized to be caused by the spatial constraints in the pores via, e.g., size exclusion effects. It is demonstrated here that the increase in turnover rate as well as the formation of a maximum and the rate drop are intrinsic consequences of the increasingly dense ionic environment in zeolite. The molecularly sized confines of zeolite create a unique ionic environment that monotonically favors the formation of alcohol&#8208;hydronium ion complexes in the micropores. The zeolite microporous environment determines the kinetics of catalytic steps and tailors the impact of ionic strength on catalytic rates.

         <title>Ammonia Synthesis at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure from N2: A Boron&#8208;Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;centered radicals, generated by reduction of R2BCl derivatives, react with N2 all the way to borylamine formation. DFT calculations rationalize the reduction/functionalization process, involving N&#8722;N bond splitting. Hydrolysis of the mixture yields NH4+. Radical addition to N2 provides a new strategy for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Ammonia, NH3, is an essential molecule, being part of fertilizers. It is currently synthesized via the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, from the very stable dinitrogen molecule, N2 and dihydrogen, H2. This process requires high temperatures and pressures, thereby generating ca 1.6&#8201;% of the global CO2 emissions. Alternative strategies are needed to realize the functionalization of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions. Here, we show that boron&#8208;centered radicals provide a means of activating N2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure whilst allowing a radical process to occur, leading to the production of borylamines. Subsequent hydrolysis released NH4+, the acidic form of NH3. EPR spectroscopy supported the intermediacy of radicals in the process, corroborated by DFT calculations, which rationalized the mechanism of the N2 functionalization by R2B radicals.

Electroreduction of CO on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces was investigated with in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT). Direct spectroscopic evidence for surface *CO, Cu&#8722;Oad, and Cu&#8722;OHad species was observed and confirmed with isotopic experiments. Surface *H2O is the dominant proton source for the initial protonation steps in alkaline electrolytes (pH=13).







Abstract
We have employed in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces under various conditions. Coadsorbed and structure&#8208;/potential&#8208;dependent surface species, including *CO, Cu&#8722;Oad, and Cu&#8722;OHad, were identified using electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope labeling. The relative abundance of *OH follows a &#8220;volcano&#8221; trend with applied potentials in aqueous solutions, which is yet absent in absolute alcoholic solutions. Combined with DFT calculations, we propose that the surface H2O can serve as a strong proton donor for the first protonation step in both the C1 and C2 pathways of CORR at various applied potentials in alkaline electrolytes, leaving adsorbed *OH on the surface. This work provides fresh insights into the initial protonation steps and identity of key interfacial intermediates formed during CORR on Cu surfaces.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonlinear Optical Crystal with a Building Block Containing Expanded &#960;&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>

Expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugation delocalization from traditional functional building block (B3O6)3&#8722; to the long overlooked (HxC6N7O3)(3&#8722;x)&#8722; (x=0, 1, 2) induces significantly enhanced second&#8208;order nonlinear optical response of Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8&#8201;H2O.







Abstract
Common nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals consist of traditional functional building blocks with inherent optical limitation. Herein, inspired by traditional (B3O6)3&#8722; inorganic building block, we theoretically identified a new type of organic functional building blocks and then successfully synthesized the first cyamelurate NLO crystal, Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8&#8201;H2O. To our surprise, the constituent (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; building block is not in structurally optimal arrangement, but Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8&#8201;H2O exhibits excellent optical properties including wide band gap of 4.10&#8197;eV, very large birefringence of 0.24@550&#8197;nm, and exceptionally strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response of about 12&#215;KH2PO4. Both the SHG response and birefringence are much larger than those of commercial NLO crystal &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 with optimally aligned (B3O6)3&#8722; building block. Theoretical calculations suggest that the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugation delocalization within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; vs (B3O6)3&#8722; should be responsible to the enhanced performance. This work implies that there is still much room to develop new NLO crystals with excellent functional building blocks that may be longly neglected.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Conventional Polyureas into Dynamic Covalent Poly(aminoketoenamide)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an approach for the chemical upcycling of urea bonds&#8208;containing materials. Our strategy is mediated by acetylacetone and ultimately affords dynamic covalent aminoketoenamide bonds. The here reported conversion scheme allows for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(aminoketoenamide) networks, which can be healed and reprocessed via catalyst&#8208;free thermal treatments.







Abstract
The chemical upcycling of polymers is an emerging strategy to transform post&#8208;consumer waste into higher&#8208;value chemicals and materials. However, on account of the high stability of the chemical bonds that constitute their main chains, the chemical modification of many polymers proves to be difficult. Here, we report a versatile approach for the upcycling of linear and cross&#8208;linked polyureas, which are widely used because of their high chemical stability. The treatment of these polymers or their composites with acetylacetone affords di&#8208;vinylogous amide&#8208;terminated compounds in good yield. These products can be reacted with aromatic isocyanates, and the resulting aminoketoenamide bonds are highly dynamic at elevated temperatures. We show here that this conversion scheme can be exploited for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(aminoketoenamide) networks, which are healable and reprocessable through thermal treatment without any catalyst.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Powered Asymmetric Hydrogel Nanomotors for Enhanced Immunochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using copper sulfides (Cu2&#8722;xS) with a strong absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region and a microfluidic chip in flow&#8208;focusing configuration with magnet&#8208;assisted photopolymerization, a 1064&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor with encapsulated DOX (AHNM&#8208;DOX) was developed. It demonstrated high motion efficiency and facilitated deep tissue penetration for enhanced in vivo immunochemotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomotors are appealing drug carriers, and the strength of the propelling force is important for their motion capability. Though high motion efficiency has been achieved with 808&#8197;nm light driven Janus&#8208;structured noble metal nanomotors, the NIR&#8208;I light penetration depth and material biocompatibility limit their broad application. Herein, we develop a 1064&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor (AHNM) with high motion capability and load it with doxorubicin for enhanced immunochemotherapy. Magnetic field assisted photopolymerization generates an asymmetric distribution of Fe3O4@Cu9S8 nanoparticles in the AHNM, producing self&#8208;thermophoresis as driving force under NIR&#8208;II irradiation. The AHNM is also functionalized with dopamine for the capture and retention of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to boost immune activation. The as&#8208;obtained NIR&#8208;II light driven AHNM has a high tumor tissue penetration capability and enhances immunochemotherapy, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

         <title>Stereoselective Construction of Tertiary Homoallyl Alcohols and Ethers by Nucleophilic Substitution at Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles is reported. A variety of highly sterically hindered tertiary alkyl ethers and alcohols with adjacent tertiary carbon stereocenters are obtained in good yields with excellent diastereopurity.







Abstract
An efficient method for the stereoselective construction of tertiary C&#8722;O bonds via a stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles has been developed.

     alt="Stereoselective Construction of Tertiary Homoallyl Alcohols and Ethers by Nucleophilic Substitution at Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles is reported. A variety of highly sterically hindered tertiary alkyl ethers and alcohols with adjacent tertiary carbon stereocenters are obtained in good yields with excellent diastereopurity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient method for the stereoselective construction of tertiary C&#8722;O bonds via a stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles has been developed. This substitution reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates several functional groups, providing a new access to the stereoselective formation of highly congested tertiary homoallyl alcohols and ethers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predicting Collagen Triple Helix Stability through Additive Effects of Terminal Residues and Caps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen model peptides are like a construction set. The stability of collagen triple helices is critically determined by the frame, terminal residues, capping groups, and their charge state. The effects are additive and can be used to predict the melting temperatures of new collagen trimers. Combined experimental and theoretical studies shed light on the origins of these effects at the molecular level.







Abstract
Collagen model peptides (CMPs) consisting of proline&#8208;(2S,4R)&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;glycine (POG) repeats have provided a breadth of knowledge of the triple helical structure of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals. Predictive tools for triple helix stability have, however, lagged behind since the effect of CMPs with different frames ([POG]n, [OGP]n, or [GPO]n) and capped or uncapped termini have so far been underestimated. Here, we elucidated the impact of the frame, terminal functional group and its charge on the stability of collagen triple helices. Combined experimental and theoretical studies with frame&#8208;shifted, capped and uncapped CMPs revealed that electrostatic interactions, strand preorganization, interstrand H&#8208;bonding, and steric repulsion at the termini contribute to triple helix stability. We show that these individual contributions are additive and allow for the prediction of the melting temperatures of CMP trimers.

RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes is developed to access chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes.

Abstract
Disclosed herein is a RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes, which provides a highly efficient and streamlined approach to chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes from readily available starting materials. Introducing O, S, and Se into the anthanthrene skeleton leads to gradually increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distances but significantly enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlaps with the growth of the hetero&#8208;atom radius. Moderate &#960;&#8211;&#960; distance, overlap area, and intermolecular S&#8722;S interactions endow S&#8208;embedded anthanthrene (PTT) with excellent 2D charge&#8208;transport properties. Moreover, the transformation of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type S&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes is realized for the first time via the S&#8208;atom oxidation from PTT to PTT&#8208;O4. In organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices, PTT derivatives exhibit hole transport with mobilities up to 1.1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, while PTT&#8208;O4 shows electron transport with a mobility of 0.022&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregates Formed by NaCl Treatment of Aza&#8208;Coating Heptamethine Cyanines and Their Application to Monitoring Salt Stress of Plants and Promoting Photothermal Therapy of Tumors</title>

Two J&#8208;aggregates formed by NaCl treatment of aza&#8208;coating hepetamine cyanines act as functional fluorescent probes for monitoring salt stress of plants and promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.







Abstract
The cationic nature of heptamethine cyanines gives them the capacity to form aggregates with salts by electrostatic interactions. In this work, NaCl promoted J&#8208;aggregate formation of aza&#8208;coating heptamethine cyanines is explored. NaCl can induce the N&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Bz to assemble into a J&#8208;aggregate having an absorption at 890&#8197;nm. Its excellent fluorescence response to NaCl implies that it has great potential for use as a probe for tracing salt stress in plants. Moreover, NaCl also promotes formation of J&#8208;aggregates from the N&#8208;ethyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Et. The aggregate shows an intense absorption at 910&#8197;nm compared to the monomer which absorbs at 766&#8197;nm. Its J&#8208;aggregated form can serve as a photothermal agent. And the photothermal conversion efficiency is increased from 29.37&#8201;% to 57.59&#8201;%. This effort leads to the development of two applications of new cyanine J&#8208;aggregates including one for tracing salt stress of plants and the other for promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.

         <title>Photochemical Decarbonylation of Oxetanone and Azetidinone: Spectroscopy, Computational Models, and Synthetic Applications

Upon irradiation with UV light, strained heterocyclic ketones expel carbon monoxide through a Norrish type I mechanism. Ylides formed in this way cyclize with a variety of double bonds.







Abstract
Photoexcitation of cyclic ketones leads to the expulsion of carbon monoxide and a mixture of products derived from diradical intermediates. Here we show that synthetic utility of this process is improved if strained heterocyclic ketones are used. Photochemistry of 3&#8208;oxetanone and N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;azetidinone has not been previously described. Decarbonylation of these 4&#8208;membered rings proceeds through a step&#8208;wise Norrish type&#8197;I cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond from the singlet excited state. Ylides derived from both compounds are high&#8208;energy species that are kinetically stable long enough to undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of alkenes and produce substituted tetrahydrofurans and pyrrolidines. The reaction has a sufficiently wide scope to produce scaffolds that were either previously inaccessible or difficult to synthesize, thereby providing experimental access to new chemical space.

         <title>Nitrite Electroreduction to Ammonia Promoted by Molecular Carbon Dioxide with Near&#8208;unity Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>

Electrochemical reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis and reduction of nitrite pollution. However, the near 100&#8201;% reaction selectivity has yet to be achieved due to the complicated reduction route. Here, we report that carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the nitrite electroreduction to ammonia with near 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency on copper nanowire (Cu NW) catalysts in a broad potential range.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis and reduction of the level of nitrite, which is one of the major pollutants in water. However, the near 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) has yet to be achieved due to the complicated reduction route with several intermediates. Here, we report that carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the nitrite electroreduction to ammonia on copper nanowire (Cu NW) catalysts. In a broad potential range (&#8722;0.7&#8764;&#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE), the FE of nitrite to ammonia is close to 100&#8201;% with a 3.5&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to that obtained without CO2. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that CO2 acts as a catalyst to facilitate the *NO to *N step, which is the rate determining step for ammonia synthesis. The promotion effect of CO2 can be expanded to electroreduction of other nitro&#8208;compounds, such as nitrate to ammonia and nitrobenzene to aniline.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode with 96&#8201;% Utilization Rate Enabled by Solvation Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>

The introduction of sulfolane forms a new solvation structure of Zn2+ ions in aqueous electrolytes, which significantly inhibits the side reactions of the Zn anode and realizes a stable Zn anode with high areal capacity and high utilization rate.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZBs) show promises for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is generally low due to side reactions in the aqueous electrolyte caused by the active water molecules. Here, we design a novel solvation structure in the electrolyte by introduction of sulfolane (SL). Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental tests show that SL remodels the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, which significantly reduces the side reactions of Zn anode and achieves high ZUR under large capacities. Specifically, the symmetric and asymmetric cells could achieve a maximum of &#8764;96&#8201;% ZUR at an areal capacity of 24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In a ZUR of &#8764;67&#8201;%, the developed Zn&#8722;V2O5 full cell can be stably cycled for 500&#8197;cycles with an energy density of 180&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and Zn&#8208;AC capacitor is stable for 5000&#8197;cycles. This electrolyte structural engineering strategy provides new insight into achieving high ZUR of Zn anodes for high performance AZBs.

Amphiphilic block copolymers of polyphosphinoboranes, [H2BPPhH]110&#8208;b&#8208;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11, have been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the catalytic reversible chain transfer dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2 (R=Ph, h&#8208;hexyl). These self&#8208;assemble in THF:hexane solutions to form nanostructured rod&#8208;like micelles, the morphology of which can be controlled by solvent polarity.







Abstract
An amphiphilic block copolymer of polyphosphinoborane has been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the sequential catalytic dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2 (R=Ph, n&#8208;hexyl), using the simple pre&#8208;catalyst [Rh(Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2)2]Cl. Speciation, mechanism and polymer chain growth studies support a step&#8208;growth process where reversible chain transfer occurs, i.e. H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2/oligomer/polymer can all coordinate with, and be activated by, the catalyst. Block copolymer [H2BPPhH]110&#8208;b&#8208;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11 can be synthesized and self&#8208;assembles in solution to form either rod&#8208;like micelles or vesicles depending on solvent polarity.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Stability in Spinel Cobalt Oxides through Geometrical Sites Occupation towards Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through tuning geometrical sites occupation, (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs with Mnoct, Nioct, Nitet shows excellent OER activity. The Ni/Mn substitution modulates the normal surface states of CoCo2O4 from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficient and thus leading to the decoupled proton&#8208;electron transfer to reconstruct a more stable surface. The optimal balance between the electroactivity and stability ensures a remarkable OER performance.







Abstract
Designing active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are vitally important to various energy conversion devices. Herein, we introduce elements Ni and Mn into (Co)tet(Co2)octO4 nanosheets (NSs) at fixed geometrical sites, including Mnoct, Nioct, and Nitet, to optimize the initial geometrical structure and modulate the CoCo2O4 surface from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficiency. The pristine (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 281.6&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, without damaging their initial activity, the activated (Act)&#8208;(Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs after surface reconstruction exhibit long&#8208;term stability of 100&#8197;h under 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or even 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The optimal balance between electroactivity and stability leads to remarkable OER performances, providing a pivotal guideline for designing ideal electrocatalysts and inspiring more works to focus on the dynamic change of each occupation site component.

         <title>Reduction of Na+ within a {Mg2Na2} Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg2Na2} assembly with basic molecules that are less prone to reduction than the sodium cation itself induces the complete extrusion of the elemental alkali metal.







Abstract
Ionic compounds containing sodium cations are notable for their stability and resistance to redox reactivity unless highly reducing electrical potentials are applied. Here we report that treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg2Na2} species with non&#8208;reducible organic bases induces the spontaneous and completely selective extrusion of sodium metal and oxidation of the MgI centers to the more conventional MgII state. Although these processes are also characterized by a structural reorganisation of the initially chelated diamide spectator ligand, computational quantum chemical studies indicate that intramolecular electron transfer is abetted by the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) of the {Mg2Na2} ensemble, which arise exclusively from the 3s valence atomic orbitals of the constituent sodium and magnesium atoms.

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C@Fe3N with both lithiophilic property and catalytic feature can simultaneously address the growth of dendritic Li in the anode and intermediates shuttling from the cathode. These synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;organosulfur full cell with practically necessary parameters.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.

         <title>Assessing the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Mice Using a Fluorescence Nanosensor for the Simultaneous Detection and Imaging of pH and Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we constructed a fluorescence nanosensor based on MOFs for the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation level in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Blood tests and two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging were used to monitor changes of blood pH and phosphate levels at different stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.







Abstract
The inflammatory microenvironment involves changes in pH and protein phosphorylation state and is closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis (AS). Herein, we constructed a dual&#8208;detection fluorescence nanosensor PCN&#8208;NP&#8208;HPZ based on post modification of MOFs, which realized the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation through the pH&#8208;sensitive group piperazine and the ZrIV node of the MOFs. The sensors were used to monitor changes in blood pH and phosphate levels at different time stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was also performed in the vascular endothelium. Blood tests combined with two&#8208;photon fluorescence images indicated that in the early stage of AS, blood and tissue pH levels were lower than that of the normal mice, while phosphate and tissue phosphorylation levels were higher than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.

         <title>Boosting Benzene Oxidation with a Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Controlled Nuclearity Effect on Iron Sub&#8208;Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic layer deposition approach precisely tunes the nuclearity of Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts anchored on N,O&#8208;doped carbon nanorods. The electronic properties and spin configuration of the sub&#8208;nanocatalysts are nuclearity dependent and dominate H2O2 activation modes and the adsorption strength of active O species on Fe sites during C&#8722;H oxidation. The single&#8208;atom catalyst, Fe1&#8208;NOC, achieves state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for benzene oxidation.







Abstract
A fundamental understanding of the nature of nuclearity effects is important for the rational design of superior sub&#8208;nanocatalysts with low nuclearity, but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Using atomic layer deposition, we precisely synthesized Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts with tunable nuclearity (Fe1&#8211;Fe4) anchored on N,O&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NOC). The electronic properties and spin configuration of the Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts were nuclearity dependent and dominated the H2O2 activation modes and adsorption strength of active O species on Fe sites toward C&#8722;H oxidation. The Fe1&#8208;NOC single atom catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for benzene oxidation to phenol, which is ascribed to its unique coordination environment (Fe1N2O3) and medium spin state (t2g4eg1); turnover frequencies of 407&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1869&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C were obtained, which is 3.4, 5.7, and 13.6 times higher than those of Fe dimer, trimer, and tetramer catalysts, respectively.

         <title>A Nanocomposite of Bismuth Clusters and Bi2O2CO3 Sheets for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst derived from Bi2S3 is very powerful for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, achieving a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass formate yield of 67&#8201;%. The active catalyst is composed of Bi nanoclusters on Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the interfacial Bi site plays a pivotal role.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon&#8208;neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Herein, we report a powerful Bi2S3&#8208;derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.95&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single&#8208;pass yield of formate reach 80&#8201;% and 67&#8201;%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100&#8197;h at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 has been produced continuously.

&lt;p&gt;An electrocatalyst derived from Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is very powerful for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formic acid, achieving a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% and a single-pass formate yield of 67&#8201;%. The active catalyst is composed of Bi nanoclusters on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets and the interfacial Bi site plays a pivotal role.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewable-electricity-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon-neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Herein, we report a powerful Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.95&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single-pass yield of formate reach 80&#8201;% and 67&#8201;%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100&#8197;h at an industrial-relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; has been produced continuously. Our operando spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal the dynamic evolution of the catalyst into a nanocomposite composed of Bi&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; clusters and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets and the pivotal role of Bi&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Halosulfonylation of Strain&#8208;Release Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of strained hydrocarbons is described that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. Sulfonyl halides featuring aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents are generated in situ from sulfinate salts and convenient halogen atom sources. This chemistry enables the synthesis of an array of halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale. Hal=Halogen.







Abstract
Sulfonylated aromatics are commonplace motifs in drugs and agrochemicals. However, methods for the direct synthesis of sulfonylated non&#8208;classical arene bioisosteres, which could improve the physicochemical properties of drug and agrochemical candidates, are limited. Here we report a solution to this challenge: a one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of [1.1.1]propellane, [3.1.1]propellane and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. The sulfonyl halides used in this chemistry feature aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents, and are conveniently generated in situ from readily available sulfinate salts and halogen atom sources. This methodology enables the synthesis of an array of pharmaceutically and agrochemically relevant halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale.

         <title>A Shuttle&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Cu&#8722;Li Battery Based on a Sandwich&#8208;Structured Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging Cu cathode dissolution/deposition have been hindered by electrolyte related issues, including Cu crossover, low conductivity, etc. Here the authors design a sandwich solid&#8208;state electrolyte by sandwiching a Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 pellet with two deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gels to address these issues. The as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li battery exhibits significantly improved cyclability and practical energy density.







Abstract
Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging the two&#8208;electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8722;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte for solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li batteries, in which a deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gel with high Cu&#8208;ion solubility is devised as a Cu&#8208;ion reservoir while a ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 interlayer is used to block Cu&#8208;ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte, a solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1&#8201;485&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1and long&#8208;term cyclability with 97&#8201;% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li batteries.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Automated Mannoside Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (AFGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the C(sp3)&#8722;F bond at C2 to enable &#945;&#8208;stereocontrolled glycosylation that eliminates the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. Reactions display extremely high levels of efficiency and selectivity, and the method has been demonstrated in the synthesis of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannoses.







Abstract
Automated glycan assembly (AGA) on solid support has become invaluable in reconciling the biological importance of complex carbohydrates with the persistent challenges associated with reproducible synthesis. Whilst AGA platforms have transformed the construction of many natural sugars, validation in the construction of well&#8208;defined (site&#8208;selectively modified) glycomimetics is in its infancy. Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, the biomedical prominence of 2&#8208;fluoro sugars and the remarkable selectivities observed in fluorine&#8208;directed glycosylation, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (FDAGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the fluorine atom for stereocontrolled glycosylation on solid support, thereby eliminating the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. The logical design of C2&#8208;fluorinated mannose building blocks, and their application in the fully (&#945;&#8208;)stereocontrolled automated assembly of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannosides, is disclosed. This operationally simple strategy can be integrated into existing AGA and post&#8208;AGA protocols to augment the scope of programmed carbohydrate synthesis.

         <title>Oligothiophene&#8208;Ring&#8208;Strapped Perylene Bisimides: Functionalizable Coaxial Donor&#8211;Acceptor Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocycle consisting of oligothiophene&#8208;ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide was synthesized, and the perpendicular donor&#8211;acceptor orientation was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal analysis. This functionalizable macrocycle enabled the synthesis of the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer. The precise positioning and preferred orientation of donor and acceptor units in this macrocycle led to ultrafast electron transfer and long&#8208;lived charge separation.







Abstract
Aesthetic designs from nature enable new knowledge to be gained and, at the same time, inspire scientific models. In this context, multicomponent macrocycles embody the advantage of precisely positioning the structural units to achieve efficient communication between them. However, the construction of a functionalizable macrocycle for ultrafast charge separation and stabilization has not been attempted. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and transient absorption of a new functionalizable macrocycle consisting of an oligothiophene&#8208;ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide. Transient absorption results point to a sequential improvement in charge separation and stabilization from the macrocycle to the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer due to the unique design. Our macrocycle design with a supportive spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor units will inspire the development of more complex synthetic systems with exciting electron&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;separation features.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Enhanced Potentiometric Aptasensing with Magneto&#8208;Controlled Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>

Aptamer&#8208;assembled magnetic beads can be directly measured by using a magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric ion sensor. The potentiometric aptasensing system enables rapid, efficient discrimination and quantification of multiple analytes with the assistance of deep learning models.







Abstract
Bioelectronic sensors that report charge changes of a biomolecule upon target binding enable direct and sensitive analyte detection but remain a major challenge for potentiometric measurement, mainly due to Debye Length limitations and the need for molecular&#8208;level platforms. Here, we report on a magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric method to directly and sensitively measure the target&#8208;binding induced charge change of DNA aptamers assembled on magnetic beads using a polymeric membrane potentiometric ion sensor. The potentiometric responses of the negatively charged aptamer, serving as a receptor and reporter, were dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Based on a potentiometric array, this non&#8208;equilibrium measurement technique combined with deep learning algorithms allows for rapidly and reliably classifying and quantifying diverse small molecules using antibiotics as models. This potentiometric strategy opens new modalities for sensing applications.

         <title>Di&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenidecaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) and Its Bis&#8208;Organopalladium Complexes: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins containing 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene as key structural elements have been prepared. The resulting macrocycle showed unexpected coordination modes toward PdII. The two bis&#8208;Pd complexes characterized in this study exhibited noteworthy chiroptical properties, including dissymmetry factors (gabs) as high as 0.038 at 763&#8197;nm, and low energy absorption bands extending into the NIR&#8208;II region.







Abstract
A non&#8208;aromatic expanded carbaporphyrinoid, incorporating two built&#8208;in 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene moieties was synthesized. The intrinsically labile structure was demonstrated by proton&#8208;triggered conformational changes between the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and quasi&#8208;M&#246;bius conformers. Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)2, the reaction produces two bis&#8208;PdII complexes with distinct coordination modes. Metal coordination serves to fix the macrocyclic frameworks with the net result that both bis&#8208;PdII complexes could be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a chiral stationary phase. The isolated enantiomers showed persistent chiroptical properties as evidenced by the intense response in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and the record high absorption dissymmetry factors (gabs of up to 0.038) seen in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. Moreover, the mutual interconversion of these two PdII complexes was found to be stereospecific and to favor the more stable isomers under weakly acidic conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptidyl Aggregates for the Fluorogenic Recognition of Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled peptidyl fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA over other topologies is presented. CV2 allows for the staining of G4s in mitochondria over the nucleus in living cells, and is further employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA damage.







Abstract
The selective monitoring of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures in living cells is important to elucidate their functions and reveal their value as diagnostic or therapeutic targets. Here we report a fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G4 DNA over antiparallel topologies. CV2 was constructed by conjugating the excimer&#8208;forming CV dye with a peptide sequence (l&#8208;Arg&#8208;l&#8208;Gly&#8208;glutaric acid) that specifically recognizes G4s. CV2 forms self&#8208;assembled, red excimer&#8208;emitting nanoaggregates in aqueous media, but specific binding to G4s triggers its disassembly into rigidified monomeric dyes, leading to a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, selective permeation of CV2 stains G4s in mitochondria over the nucleus. CV2 was employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. These properties make CV2 appealing to investigate the possible roles of mtDNA G4s in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction.

         <title>Medium/High&#8208;Entropy Amalgamated Core/Shell Nanoplate Achieves Efficient Formic Acid Catalysis for Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HP) with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell has been successfully achieved. The HEA HP not only displays the record formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) performance, but also readily achieves much higher peak power density (321.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) along with the long&#8208;term lifetime under the operating fuel cell conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have been attracting extensive research interests in designing advanced nanomaterials, while their precise control is still in the infancy stage. Herein, we have reported a well&#8208;defined PtBiPbNiCo hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HPs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Structure analysis decodes that the HEA HP is constructed with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell. Significantly, the HEA HPs can reach the specific and mass activities of 27.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 7.1&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), being the record catalyst ever achieved in Pt&#8208;based catalysts, and can realize the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power density (321.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in fuel cell. Further experimental and theoretical analyses collectively evidence that the hexagonal intermetallic core/atomic layer shell structure and multi&#8208;element synergy greatly promote the direct dehydrogenation pathway of formic acid molecule and suppress the formation of CO*.

         <title>Photocatalytic Deuterium Atom Transfer Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes with High Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetically benign deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has been achieved. This DAT protocol realized higher functional group (FG) tolerance and chemoselectivity than the existing method, and allowed access to complex deuterated compounds including a heavy drug and deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids.







Abstract
Due to its mild reaction conditions and unique chemoselectivity, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) hydrogenation represents an indispensable method for the synthesis of complex molecules. Its analog using deuterium, deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration, is expected to enable access to complex deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds. However, DAT deuteration has been scarcely studied for synthetic purposes, and a method that possesses the favorable characteristics of HAT hydrogenations has remained elusive. Herein, we report a protocol for the photocatalytic DAT deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. In contrast to the previous DAT deuteration, this method tolerates a variety of synthetically useful functional groups including haloarenes.

&lt;p&gt;A synthetically benign deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration of electron-deficient alkenes has been achieved. This DAT protocol realized higher functional group (FG) tolerance and chemoselectivity than the existing method, and allowed access to complex deuterated compounds including a heavy drug and deuterium-labeled amino acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its mild reaction conditions and unique chemoselectivity, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) hydrogenation represents an indispensable method for the synthesis of complex molecules. Its analog using deuterium, deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration, is expected to enable access to complex deuterium-labeled compounds. However, DAT deuteration has been scarcely studied for synthetic purposes, and a method that possesses the favorable characteristics of HAT hydrogenations has remained elusive. Herein, we report a protocol for the photocatalytic DAT deuteration of electron-deficient alkenes. In contrast to the previous DAT deuteration, this method tolerates a variety of synthetically useful functional groups including haloarenes. The late-stage deuteration also allows access to deuterated amino acids as well as donepezil-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of DAT chemistry to become the alternative method of choice for preparing deuterium-containing molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Aminoalkylative Amination of Unactivated Aminoenynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective aminoalkylative amination of unactivated aminoenynes by using aminals or aldehydes and amines as coupling partners has been developed, which permits facile synthesis of various chiral exocyclic allenic amines bearing 5 to 12&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. Synthetic transformations of the chiral products were also conducted to afford structurally unique chiral spirodiamines via axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for preventing the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of alkylpalladium species by ligation of the palladium with adjacent amino&#8208;group was developed, which enabled a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing aminoalkylative amination of unactivated aminoenynes. The reaction is amenable to aminals, as well as aliphatic aldehydes with secondary amines, which provides straightforward access to structurally diverse exocyclic allenic amines bearing 5 to 12&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. With chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated palladium complex as the catalyst, an enantioselective variant was achieved with up to 93&#8201;% ee. Simultaneously, synthetic transformations of the chiral products were also conducted to afford structurally unique spirodiamines including one pharmaceutically active molecule via axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Arenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective approach for the electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes with CO2 has been developed to obtain the valuable aromatic carboxylic acids with excellent atom economy. High levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity were achieved by this electrochemical reductive activation strategy.







Abstract
Herein, a direct, metal&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as the economic and abundant carboxylic source was reported. The electrocarboxylation was carried out in an operationally simple manner with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, setting the stage for the challenging site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated (hetero)arenes. The robust nature of the electrochemical strategy was reflected by a broad scope of substrates with excellent atom economy and unique selectivity. Notably, the direct and selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of various challenging arenes worked well in this approach, including electron&#8208;deficient naphthalenes, pyridines, simple phenyl derivatives, and substituted quinolines. The method benefits from being externally catalyst&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free, which makes it extremely attractive for potential applications.

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations and Implications for Catalysis of Quasi&#8208;d10 Configurations in Formal Gold(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the interplay of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computational analysis, we show that gold +I and +III complexes, despite their physically distinct electronic structures, tend to activate substrates to similar extents. We focus in particular on the role of electron&#8208;sharing covalency of the metal&#8208;ligand bonds and provide an explanation for the often&#8208;similar reactivities observed for gold complexes in these physical oxidation states.







Abstract
Several gold +I and +III complexes are investigated computationally and spectroscopically, focusing on the d&#8208;configuration and physical oxidation state of the metal center. Density functional theory calculations reveal the non&#8208;negligible electron&#8208;sharing covalent character of the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#963;&#8208;bonding framework. The bonding of gold(III) is shown to be isoelectronic to the formal CuIII complex [Cu(CF3)4]1&#8722;, in which the metal center tries to populate its formally unoccupied 3dx2&#8208;y2 orbital via &#963;&#8208;bonding, leading to a reduced d10 CuI description. However, Au L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals excitation into the d&#8208;orbital of the AuIII species is still possible, showing that a genuine d10 configuration is not achieved. We also find an increased electron&#8208;sharing nature of the &#963;&#8208;bonds in the AuI species, relative to their AgI and CuI analogues, due to the low&#8208;lying 6s orbital. We propose that gold +I and +III complexes form similar bonds with substrates, owing primarily to participation of the 5dx2&#8208;y2 or 6s orbital, respectively, in bonding, indicating why AuI and AuIII complexes often have similar reactivity.

         <title>Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm through Nanoscale Grade Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy to achieve confined mass transport at the few&#8208;nanometer scale through utilization of ordered 3d interconnected sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium, the 3d arrangement of pores was superior to the 2d system in maximizing catalyst performance.







Abstract
Nano and single&#8208;atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic&#8208;scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass&#8208;transport problem by utilizing ordered three&#8208;dimensional (3d) interconnected sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores with grade separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two&#8208;dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential route to fine&#8208;tuning few&#8208;nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.

         <title>Non&#8208;trivial Contribution of Carbon Hybridization in Carbon&#8208;based Substrates to Electrocatalytic Activities in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we investigated the correlation between carbon hybridization and sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). We reveal that the nitrogen atom doped in graphitic carbon possesses a higher local charge density and a lower Gibbs free energy towards the formation of polysulfides than in amorphous carbon. The carbon is not only limited as conductive support but also plays a non&#8208;trivial contribution to the electrocatalytic activities of SRR.







Abstract
Appling an electrochemical catalyst is an efficient strategy for inhibiting the shuttle effect and enhancing the S utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. Carbon&#8208;based materials are the most common conductive agents and catalyst supports used in Li&#8208;S batteries, but the correlation between the diversity of hybridizations and sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) catalytic activity remains unclear. Here, by establishing two forms of carbon models, i.e., graphitic carbon (GC) and amorphous carbon (AC), we observe that the nitrogen atom doped in the GC possesses a higher local charge density and a lower Gibbs free energy towards the formation of polysulfides than in the AC. And the GC&#8208;based electrode consistently inherits considerably enhanced SRR kinetics and superior cycling stability and rate capability in Li&#8208;S batteries. Therefore, the function of carbon in Li&#8208;S batteries is not only limited as conductive support but also plays an unignorable contribution to the electrocatalytic activities of SRR.

         <title>Ferroelectric Ionic Molecular Crystals with Significant Plasticity and a Low Melting Point: High Performance in Hot&#8208;Pressed Polycrystalline Plates and Melt&#8208;Grown Crystalline Sheets</title>

         <dc:description>
Guanidinium tetrafluoroborate (1) is a crystal that shows malleability and multiaxial ferroelectricity. Powder samples of 1 can be transformed by press forming or melt growing into transparent bulk crystalline plates that exhibit high ferroelectric performance, including the largest spontaneous polarization hitherto reported for bulk polycrystals of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Among ferroelectric crystals based on small molecules, plastic/ferroelectric crystals are currently receiving particular attention because they can be used as bulk polycrystals. Herein, we show that an ionic molecular ferroelectric crystal, guanidinium tetrafluoroborate, exhibits significant malleability and multiaxial ferroelectricity despite the absence of a plastic crystal phase. Powder samples of this crystal can be processed into transparent bulk crystalline plates either by press&#8208;forming or by melt&#8208;growing. The plates show high ferroelectric performance and related properties, demonstrating the largest hitherto reported spontaneous polarization for bulk polycrystals of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Owing to the ready availability of large&#8208;scale materials and processability into various bulk crystalline forms, this ferroelectric crystal represents a highly promising functional material that will boost research on diverse applications as bulk crystals.

         <title>Liquid Fluxional Ga Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we discover the fluxional property of single atom catalysts (SACs) could effectively influence the catalytic performance. Ga SACs was firstly systematically synthesized to be used in efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction for CO. The Ga SACs with the P, S atomic coordination environment displays specific fluxional properties, showing CO products with FE of &#8776;92&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Precise design and tuning of the micro&#8208;atomic structure of single atom catalysts (SACs) can help efficiently adapt complex catalytic systems. Herein, we inventively found that when the active center of the main group element gallium (Ga) is downsized to the atomic level, whose characteristic has significant differences from conventional bulk and rigid Ga catalysts. The Ga SACs with a P, S atomic coordination environment display specific flow properties, showing CO products with FE of &#8776;92&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the adaptive dynamic transition of Ga optimizes the adsorption energy of the *COOH intermediate and renews the active sites in time, leading to excellent CO2RR selectivity and stability. This liquid single atom catalysts system with dynamic interfaces lays the foundation for future exploration of synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Steric, Electronic and Conformational Synergistic Effects in the Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tertiary Amines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenging gold&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization of tertiary amine was achieved via the intermediacy of a reactive &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene. The use of a malonate group exerting electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects was key to the success of the transformation. The tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products could be subsequently oxidized to access structural motifs found in bioactive natural products.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization is a useful strategy for the straightforward formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Heteroatom bonds. In the present work, a unique approach for the challenging electrophilic Au&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization of tertiary amines is presented. Electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects exerted by the use of a malonate unit in the substrate were key to the success of this transformation. This new reactivity was applied to the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products which, under oxidative conditions, could be converted into valuable structural motifs found in bioactive alkaloid natural products.

         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes with CO2 is reported by Youai Qiu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214710). A direct metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as an economic and abundant carboxyl source was developed. The robust nature of this strategy is reflected in a broad scope of substrates, excellent atom economy, and unique selectivity.

Synergy between salt and sugar Nanometric ions like Keggin polyoxometalates are revealed to induce the cross&#8208;linking and hydrogel formation of polymeric sugars, namely non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers, as reported by Max Hohenschutz, Walter Richtering, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202210208). This novel gelation phenomenon exceeds the thickening effects of typical additives like classical salts and surfactants by orders of magnitude and is due to the superchaotropicity of the nano&#8208;ions, which drives them out of the water bulk onto the polymers.

         <title>Cover Picture: Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical approaches enable the efficient synthesis of a variety of chemicals. Hirokazu Kobayashi, Atsushi Fukuoka et&#8197;al. report in their Research Article (e202214229) that an activated carbon catalyst with weak acid sites converts chitin, an abundant but highly recalcitrant biomass, selectively into chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides under ball&#8208;milling conditions. Large chitin molecules are hydrolyzed more rapidly than small oligomers, leading to a high selectivity. The produced oligosaccharides enhance plant immune systems so that crops can withstand pathogens with low agrochemical use.

         <title>Towards a Cradle&#8208;to&#8208;Cradle Polyolefin Lifecycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective depolymerization of polyethylene to propylene was achieved by two independent studies using a tandem catalysis approach. By combining a dehydrogenation, an isomerization and an ethenolysis catalyst under an ethylene atmosphere, propylene was the favoured product which could be further used as precursor for polypropylene production.







Abstract
Achieving efficient chemical depolymerization of waste polyolefins to monomers remains an unsolved challenge, while it could be an effective means to avoid further waste accumulation in the environment and generate economic benefits. In a recent publication by Conk et&#8197;al., polyethylene (PE) is converted to propylene, the second most used monomer in the polymer industry. The conversion is achieved via a tandem catalysis approach in which partially unsaturated PE chains react with ethylene to generate propylene with yields as high as 87&#8201;%. The study is a first proof of concept showcasing a selective chemical depolymerization of PE to a monomer. Future research is expected to focus on the catalyst optimization, process design, and compatibility with contaminated and multi&#8208;polymer waste streams.

         <title>Kinetics Driven by Hollow Nanoreactors: An Opportunity for Controllable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of hollow nanoreactors offers new opportunities for developing controllable catalysis. This Review presents the basic context of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the structure&#8211;performance relation for kinetics within hollow nanoreactors. The proposed perspectives may contribute to further theoretical innovations in controllable catalysis.







Abstract
As a novel class of catalytic materials, hollow nanoreactors offer new opportunities for improving catalytic performance owing to their higher controllability on molecular kinetic behavior. Nevertheless, to achieve controllable catalysis with specific purposes, the catalytic mechanism occurring inside hollow nanoreactors remains to be further understood. In this context, this Review presents a focused discussion about the basic concept of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory for hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the intrinsic correlation between key structural parameters of hollow nanoreactors and molecular kinetic behaviors. We aim to provide in&#8208;depth insights into understanding kinetics occurred within typical hollow nanoreactors. The perspectives proposed in this paper may contribute to the development of the fundamental theoretical framework of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) show potential for a wide range of applications based on their unique characteristics, such as interpenetrated channels, low densities, high surface areas, and high chemical stabilities. In this Minireview, we summarize the strategies for the preparation of functional 3D COFs, including crystallization methods and functionalization pathways, and provide an overview of their potential applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with spatially periodic networks demonstrate significant advantages over their 2D counterparts, including enhanced specific surface areas, interconnected channels, and more sufficiently exposed active sites. Nevertheless, research on these materials has met an impasse due to serious problems in crystallization and stability, which must be solved for practical applications. In this Minireview, we first summarize some strategies for preparing functional 3D COFs, including crystallization techniques and functionalization methods. Hereafter, applications of these functional materials are presented, covering adsorption, separation, catalysis, fluorescence, sensing, and batteries. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for the development of 3D COFs are discussed.

         <title>Doping/Alloying Pathways to Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskites with Ultimate Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites emit broadband visible photoluminescence originating from self&#8208;trapped excitonic states. Introduction of &#8220;alien&#8221; metals via doping or alloying into perovskite matrices often results in a dramatic enhancement of both light absorbance and emission. Mechanisms, challenges, and applications of these phenomena constitute the topic of the present Minireview.







Abstract
Tailored modifications of halide lead&#8208;free perovskites (LFPs) via doping/alloying with metal cations have been recognized as a promising pathway to highly efficient inorganic phosphors with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of up to 100&#8201;%. Such materials typically display selective sensitivity to UV light, a broad PL range, and long PL lifetimes as well as a unique compositional variability and stability&#8212;an ideal combination for many light&#8208;harvesting applications. This Minireview presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in doped LFPs, focusing on the reports published mostly in the last two to three years. We discuss the factors determining the efficiency and spectral parameters of the broadband PL of doped LFPs depending on the dopant and host matrix, both in micro&#8208; and nanocrystalline states, address the most relevant challenges this rapidly developing research area is facing, and outline the most promising concepts for further progress in this field.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Complex Nucleoside Antibiotics A201A, A201D and A201E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired total synthesis of A201A, A201D and A201E is presented, as modeled on the biosynthetic pathway reported previously. The L&#8208;galactofuranose was obtained from a cheap and readily available D&#8208;galactopyranose through a C1/C6 head&#8208;to&#8208;tail oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;switch strategy. The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, an essential core structure of the A201 family, was accessed through remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation.

The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, a core structure of the A201 family, was obtained by remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation. We accomplished the total synthesis of A201A and A201E based on the critical 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside moiety through late&#8208;stage glycosylation without any interference from basic dimethyl adenosine. We also confirmed the absolute configuration of A201E by total synthesis. This modular synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of A201 family antibiotics, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action. This study satisfies the increasing demand for developing novel antibiotics inspired by the A201 family.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations: Divergent Synthesis of Indole[a]&#8208; and [b]&#8208;Fused Polycycles

The exposure of (alkylphenyl)ethynyl substituted phenyl azides to JohnPhosAu(I) catalysts leads to the divergent synthesis of indole&#8208;fused polycycles via N&#8208; or C&#8208;cyclization facilitated via benzyl to &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. The chemoselectivity depends on the counter&#8208;anion, the reactivity of the carbene, and the attached alkyl groups at the benzylic position.







Abstract
Phenyl azides substituted by an (alkylphenyl)ethynyl group facilitate benzylic sp3(C&#8722;H) functionalization in the presence of a JohnPhosAu catalyst, resulting in indole&#8208;fused tetra&#8208; and pentacycles via divergent N&#8208; or C&#8208;cyclization. The chemoselectivity is influenced depending on the counter&#8208;anion, the electron density of the &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene, and the alkyl groups stabilizing the benzylic carbocation originating from a 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. An isotopic labeling experiment demonstrates the involvement of an indolylgold(I) species resulting from a tautomerization that is much faster than the deauration. The formation of a benzylic sp3(C&#8722;H) functionalization leading to an indole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.

         <title>Structural Influence of Lone Pairs in GeP2N4, a Germanium(II) Nitridophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the discovery of the first germanium(II) nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, we present a way to use the stereochemical influence of lone pairs to modify crystal structures. This approach could be applied to other literature&#8208;known nitridophosphates by cation exchange, altering the crystal structures and thus further increasing their already widespread properties and field of application.







Abstract
Owing to their widespread properties, nitridophosphates are of high interest in current research. Explorative high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature investigations yielded various compounds with stoichiometry MP2N4 (M=Be, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cd), which are discussed as ultra&#8208;hard or luminescent materials, when doped with Eu2+. Herein, we report the first germanium nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, synthesized from Ge3N4 and P3N5 at 6&#8197;GPa and 800&#8201;&#176;C. The structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, IR and NMR spectroscopy. The highly condensed network of PN4&#8208;tetrahedra shows a strong structural divergence to other MP2N4 compounds, which is attributed to the stereochemical influence of the lone pair of Ge2+. Thus, the formal exchange of alkaline earth cations with Ge2+ may open access to various compounds with literature&#8208;known stoichiometry, however, new structures and properties.

         <title>(SCp)Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura Reaction for Building&#8208;up Axial Chirality: Counteranion&#8208;Directed Switching of Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction enabled by a chiral tri&#8208;substituted SCpRh(III)&#8208;catalyst is described. The desired axially chiral products can be afforded in moderate to excellent yields (up to 85&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). Meanwhile, DFT calculations provide rationales behind this unique phenomenon of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of the pathways in C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction is an important method for extending &#960;&#8208;systems by forging multi&#8208;substituted benzene rings via double aryl C&#8722;H activation and annulation with alkynes. However, the development of highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction remains rather challenging. Herein, we report an asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction between 1&#8208;aryl benzo[h]isoquinolines and internal alkynes enabled by a SCpRh&#8208;catalyst. Judiciously choosing the counteranion of the Rh&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the desired reactivity over the competitive formation of azoniahelicenes. Detailed mechanistic studies support the proposal of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of reaction pathways in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Rational Design of a Facially Coordinating P,N,N Ligand for Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn catalyst has been rationally redesigned to repel sp3hybridised substituents while attracting sp2 substituents, and hence enable enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic ketones. DFT calculations enable a robust prediction of the level of enantiocontrol across a range of substrates.







Abstract
DFT calculations on the full catalytic cycle for manganese catalysed enantioselective hydrogenation of a selection of ketones have been carried out at the PBE0&#8208;D3PCM//RI&#8208;BP86PCM level. Mn complexes of an enantiomerically pure chiral P,N,N ligand have been found to be most reactive when adopting a facial coordination mode. The use of a new ligand with an ortho&#8208;substituted dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine motif has been calculated to completely transform the levels of enantioselectivity possible for the hydrogenation of cyclic ketones relative to the first&#8208;generation Mn catalysts. In silico evaluation of substrates has been used to identify those likely to be reduced with high enantiomer ratios (er), and others that would exhibit less selectivity; good agreements were then found in experiments. Various cyclic ketones and some acetophenone derivatives were hydrogenated with er's up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Dendritic Quaternary&#8208;Encoded Oligourethanes for Data Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing self&#8208;immolative linkages are developed for high&#8208;strength data encryption. Specifically, the fragmentation paths of dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes under MALDI&#8208;ToF MS/MS conditions can be translated into 2D matrices with &#8776;1.98&#215;1087 permutations, and each 2772&#8208;bit code 2D matrix can be further used as a unique decryption key to decipher the QR code for confidential communications.







Abstract
The use of sequence&#8208;defined digital polymers for data storage and encryption has received increasing attention due to their precision structures similar to natural biomacromolecules (e.g., DNA) but increased stability. However, the rapid development of sequencing techniques raises the concern of information leakage. Herein, dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing a photoresponsive trigger, self&#8208;immolative backbones, and a mass spectrometry tag of PEG dendron have been developed for data encryption. Although the sequence information in linear analogs can be readily deciphered by mass spectrometry, sequencing of dendritic oligourethanes cannot be achieved by either primary MS or tandem MS/MS owing to the unique spatial conformation. Intriguingly, the fragmentation pathways of a quaternary dendrimer under MS/MS conditions can be converted to 2772&#8208;bit 2D matrices with &#8776;1.98&#215;1087 permutations, serving as high&#8208;strength encryption keys for highly reliable data encryption.

         <title>Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;ion Binding as a Gelation Motif in Cellulose Ether Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;ions, like polyoxometalates and boron clusters, co&#8208;assemble strongly with non&#8208;ionic solutes in water driven by the chaotropic effect. Here, nano&#8208;ion assembly with non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers (CE) is shown to result in unprecedented thickening effects and gelation of CE&#8208;solutions. An interplay of electrostatic repulsion and attraction between chains arises upon nano&#8208;ion adsorption to the CE&#8208;polymer and provides a facile novel way of gelling CEs.







Abstract
Nanometer&#8208;sized anions (nano&#8208;ions) like polyoxometalates and boron clusters exhibit so&#8208;called superchaotropic behavior, which describes their strong binding to hydrated non&#8208;ionic matter in water. We show here that nano&#8208;ions, at millimolar concentrations, dramatically enhance the viscosity and induce gelation of aqueous solutions of non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers (CEs), a class of widely utilized polymers known for their thickening and gel&#8208;forming ability. These phenomena arise from an interplay of attractive forces and repulsive electrostatic forces between CE&#8208;chains upon nano&#8208;ion binding. The attractive forces manifest themselves as aggregation of CE&#8208;chains into a physically crosslinked polymer network (gel). In turn, the electrostatic repulsions hamper the viscosity increase and gelation.

     alt="Superchaotropic Nano-ion Binding as a Gelation Motif in Cellulose Ether Solutions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nano-ions, like polyoxometalates and boron clusters, co-assemble strongly with non-ionic solutes in water driven by the chaotropic effect. Here, nano-ion assembly with non-ionic cellulose ethers (CE) is shown to result in unprecedented thickening effects and gelation of CE-solutions. An interplay of electrostatic repulsion and attraction between chains arises upon nano-ion adsorption to the CE-polymer and provides a facile novel way of gelling CEs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanometer-sized anions (nano-ions) like polyoxometalates and boron clusters exhibit so-called superchaotropic behavior, which describes their strong binding to hydrated non-ionic matter in water. We show here that nano-ions, at millimolar concentrations, dramatically enhance the viscosity and induce gelation of aqueous solutions of non-ionic cellulose ethers (CEs), a class of widely utilized polymers known for their thickening and gel-forming ability. These phenomena arise from an interplay of attractive forces and repulsive electrostatic forces between CE-chains upon nano-ion binding. The attractive forces manifest themselves as aggregation of CE-chains into a physically crosslinked polymer network (gel). In turn, the electrostatic repulsions hamper the viscosity increase and gelation. Superchaotropic nano-ion binding emerges as a novel and general physical crosslinking motif for CE-solutions and exceeds by far the conventional thickening effects of classical salts and ionic surfactants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Photoswitching the Guest Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regular array of oriented molecular motors is presented by incorporating overcrowded alkene molecules as linker in metal&#8211;organic framework thin films. By switching between the stable and metastable states, the adsorption and diffusion properties of the guest molecules are controlled.







Abstract
Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a severe challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film's transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. As shown by gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.

Herein, we report the realization of an alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which combines N&#8208;sulfonyl hydrazones and C(sp3)&#8722;H donors through a diarylketone&#8208;enabled photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer and a subsequent fragmentation of the obtained alkylated hydrazide. This metal&#8208;free protocol provides a preparatively useful route to various medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds, such as homobenzylic ethers, aryl ethyl amines, and &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
The ability to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds from easily accessible reagents is a crucial, yet challenging endeavor for synthetic organic chemists. Herein, we report the realization of such a cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which combines N&#8208;sulfonyl hydrazones and C(sp3)&#8722;H donors through a diarylketone&#8208;enabled photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer and a subsequent fragmentation of the obtained alkylated hydrazide. This mild and metal&#8208;free protocol was employed to prepare a wide array of alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupled products and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups. The application of this chemistry further provides a preparatively useful route to various medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds, such as homobenzylic ethers, aryl ethyl amines, &#946;&#8208;amino acids and other moieties which are commonly encountered in approved pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and natural products.

         <title>Identification of Cyclohexadienyl Hydrides as Intermediates in Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insertion of arenes into metal hydride bonds has been proposed a key step in the catalytic hydrogenation of arenes. Using phosphino(imino)pyridine complexes of molybdenum, the selective insertion of benzene into Mo&#8208;hydride bonds has been observed. The isolated molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides are active precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene and release cyclohexadiene upon addition of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Treatment of phosphino(imino)pyridine (PIP) molybdenum cyclooctadiene (COD) complexes [(PIP)Mo(COD)] with dihydrogen in the presence of benzene selectively furnished the molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum&#8208;hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while para&#8208;xylene predominantly formed the molybdenum &#951;6&#8208;arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane&#8208;d12 solution of [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Earth Metal Mediated Benzene&#8208;to&#8208;Biphenyl Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attempts to isolate low&#8208;valent (BDI)Ae&#8208;Ae(BDI) complexes led to reduction of the benzene solvent and formation of (BDI)Ae&#8208;(C6H6)&#8208;Ae(BDI); BDI=&#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand, Ae=Ca or Sr. Reaction of bridging C6H62&#8722; with benzene gave (biphenyl)2&#8722; complexes. Ball&#8208;milling is an efficient synthetic tool for this dehydrogenative benzene&#8208;benzene coupling. Calculations suggest attack of C6H62&#8722; at benzene. This is facilitated by Ae2+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;benzene coordination.







Abstract
Complex [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6), with a C6H62&#8722; dianion bridging two Ca2+ ions, reacts with benzene to yield [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(biphenyl) with a bridging biphenyl2&#8722; dianion (DIPePBDI=HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2; DIPeP=2,6&#8208;CH(Et)2&#8208;phenyl). The biphenyl complex was also prepared by reacting [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6) with biphenyl or by reduction of [(DIPePBDI)CaI]2 with KC8 in presence of biphenyl. Benzene&#8208;benzene coupling was also observed when the deep purple product of ball&#8208;milling [(DIPPBDI)CaI(THF)]2 with K/KI was extracted with benzene (DIPP=2,6&#8208;CH(Me)2&#8208;phenyl) giving crystalline [(DIPPBDI)Ca(THF)]2(biphenyl) (52&#8201;% yield). Reduction of [(DIPePBDI)SrI]2 with KC8 gave highly labile [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(C6H6) as a black powder (61&#8201;% yield) which reacts rapidly and selectively with benzene to [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(biphenyl). DFT calculations show that the most likely route for biphenyl formation is a pathway in which the C6H62&#8722; dianion attacks neutral benzene. This is facilitated by metal&#8208;benzene coordination.

Benzene-benzene coupling was also observed when the deep purple product of ball-milling [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)CaI(THF)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with K/KI was extracted with benzene (DIPP=2,6-CH(Me)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-phenyl) giving crystalline [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)Ca(THF)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(biphenyl) (52&#8201;% yield). Reduction of [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)SrI]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; gave highly labile [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)Sr]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) as a black powder (61&#8201;% yield) which reacts rapidly and selectively with benzene to [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;BDI)Sr]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(biphenyl). DFT calculations show that the most likely route for biphenyl formation is a pathway in which the C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion attacks neutral benzene. This is facilitated by metal-benzene coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bayesian Self&#8208;Optimization for Telescoped Continuous Flow Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autonomous continuous flow platform for the rapid development of multistep synthetic pathways is reported. New multipoint sampling and Bayesian optimization techniques were combined, enabling simultaneous identification of optimum reaction conditions within a pharmaceutical process. The short optimization times achieved are promising for development of telescoped reactions in the future.







Abstract
The optimization of multistep chemical syntheses is critical for the rapid development of new pharmaceuticals. However, concatenating individually optimized reactions can lead to inefficient multistep syntheses, owing to chemical interdependencies between the steps. Herein, we develop an automated continuous flow platform for the simultaneous optimization of telescoped reactions. Our approach is applied to a Heck cyclization&#8208;deprotection reaction sequence, used in the synthesis of a precursor for 1&#8208;methyltetrahydroisoquinoline C5 functionalization. A simple method for multipoint sampling with a single online HPLC instrument was designed, enabling accurate quantification of each reaction, and an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathways. Notably, integration of Bayesian optimization techniques identified an 81&#8201;% overall yield in just 14&#8197;h, and revealed a favorable competing pathway for formation of the desired product.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yields in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Antimony (III) Chlorides with the [SbCl5] Geometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic antimony halides have attracted increasing attention due to the non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). To shed light on the structural factors that contribute to the high PLQY, five pairs of antimony halides with general formula A2SbCl5 and A2Sb2Cl8 are synthesized via two distinct methods and characterized. The A2SbCl5 type adopts square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry with near&#8208;unity PLQY, while the A2Sb2Cl8 adopts seesaw dimmer [Sb2Cl8] geometry with PLQY~0%. Through combined data analysis with the literature, we have found that A2SbCl5 series with square pyramidal geometry generally has much longer Sb&#8230;Sb distances, leading to more expressed lone pairs of Sb (III). Additional factors including Sb&#9472;Cl distance and stability of antimony chlorides may also affect PLQY. Our targeted synthesis and correlated insights provide efficient tools to precisely form highly emissive materials for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Photodegradability into Vinylic Polymers via Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic allylic sulfides were obtained through intramolecular photocycloaddition of coumarin under UVA light. Subsequent radical ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with MA using RAFT, incorporated the coumarin dimers into the backbone of polymers. By decreasing the irradiation wavelength to UVB light or exposing the polymer to sun light, the photocycloreversion of the imbedded coumarin dimers initiated photodegradation of the polymer.







Abstract
Incorporation of photolabile moieties into the polymer backbone holds promise to remotely&#8208;control polymer degradation. However, suitable synthetic avenues are limited, especially for radical polymerizations. Here we report a strategy to program photodegradability into vinylic polymers by exploiting the wavelength selectivity of photocycloadditions for radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP). Irradiation of coumarin terminated allylic sulfides with UVA light initiated intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition producing cyclic macromonomers. Subsequent RAFT&#8208;mediated rROP with methyl acrylate yielded copolymers that inherited the photoreactivity of the cyclic parent monomer. Irradiation with UVB initiated efficient photocycloreversion of the coumarin dimers, causing polymer degradation within minutes under UVB light or days under sunlight exposure. Our synthetic strategy may pave the way to insert photolabile linkages into vinylic polymers, tuning degradation for specific wavelengths.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoximines via Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective C&#8722;H Borylation: A Remarkable Sidearm Effect of Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational&#8208;designed chiral bidentate boryl ligand (CBL) with a bulky side arm was effective in iridium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;and enantioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;silyl diaryl sulfoximines, affording a vast array of non&#8208;annulated chiral diaryl sulfoximines (39 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%). DFT calculations revealed that the side arm was critical to confer high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity by virtue of the steric effect.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of prochiral sulfoximines for non&#8208;annulated products remains a formidable challenge. We herein report iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;silyl diaryl sulfoximines using a well&#8208;designed chiral bidentate boryl ligand with a bulky side arm. This method is capable of accommodating a broad range of substrates under mild reaction conditions, affording a vast array of chiral sulfoximines with high enantioselectivities. We also demonstrated the synthetic utility on a preparative&#8208;scale C&#8722;H borylation for diverse downstream transformations, including the synthesis of chiral version of bioactive molecules. Computational studies showed that the bulky side arm of the ligand confers high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric effect.

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis of Urea with Nitrate and Carbon Dioxide over Iron&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based electrocatalyst was fabricated by a facile liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation technique, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis with CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The superior performance is ascribed to the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe3O4 on CNTs as the dual active sites for facilitating the generation of *NH2 and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts to generate key *NH2 and *CO intermediates is crucial for ambient urea electrosynthesis with nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Here we report a liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation method to fabricate symbiotic graphitic carbon encapsulated amorphous iron and iron oxide nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe3O4/CNTs). Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe3O4/CNTs exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis using NO3&#8722; and CO2, affording a urea yield of 1341.3&#177;112.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a faradic efficiency of 16.5&#177;6.1&#8201;% at ambient conditions. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe3O4 on CNTs provide dual active sites for the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722; and CO2, thus generating key *NH2 and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation. This work would be helpful for design and development of high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts for ambient urea synthesis.

         <title>Programmable 3D Hexagonal Geometry of DNA Tensegrity Triangles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In DNA nanotechnology, the programmability of non&#8208;canonical interactions is a key area of exploration. Here, we present three methods for programming a non&#8208;canonical hexagonal arrangement of normally rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles. We also determine cross&#8208;talking and reconfiguration between hexagonal and rhombohedral DNA crystals. These methods allow for additional versatility and programmability of non&#8208;canonical 3D DNA constructs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical interactions in DNA remain under&#8208;explored in DNA nanotechnology. Recently, many structures with non&#8208;canonical motifs have been discovered, notably a hexagonal arrangement of typically rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles that forms through non&#8208;canonical sticky end interactions. Here, we find a series of mechanisms to program a hexagonal arrangement using: the sticky end sequence; triangle edge torsional stress; and crystallization condition. We showcase cross&#8208;talking between Watson&#8211;Crick and non&#8208;canonical sticky ends in which the ratio between the two dictates segregation by crystal forms or combination into composite crystals. Finally, we develop a method for reconfiguring the long&#8208;range geometry of formed crystals from rhombohedral to hexagonal and vice versa. These data demonstrate fine control over non&#8208;canonical motifs and their topological self&#8208;assembly. This will vastly increase the programmability, functionality, and versatility of rationally designed DNA constructs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;controllable Luminescence from Radicals Leading to Ratiometric Emission Switching via Dynamic Intermolecular Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;controllable luminescence from a new molecular radical system featuring photoinduced structural change and dynamic intermolecular coupling was achieved. Unprecedented ratiometric emission with a wide range of color changes was demonstrated. Luminescence&#8208;encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns with a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; mode are demonstrated by employing the dynamic luminescent radical material.







Abstract
The development of photoinduced luminescent radicals with dynamic emission color is still challenging. Herein we report a novel molecular radical system (TBIQ) that shows photo&#8208;controllable luminescence, leading to a wide range of ratiometric color changes via light excitation. The conjugated skeleton of TBIQ is decorated with steric&#8208;demanding tertiary butyl groups that enable appropriate intermolecular interaction to make dynamic intermolecular coupling possible for controllable behaviors. We reveal that the helicenic pseudo&#8208;planar conformation of TBIQ experiences a planarization process after light excitation, leading to more compactly stacked supermolecules and thus generating radicals via intermolecular charge transfer. The photo&#8208;controllable luminescent radical system is employed for a high&#8208;level information encryption application. This study may offer unique insight into molecular dynamic motion for optical manufacturing and broaden the scope of smart&#8208;responsive materials for advanced applications.

         <title>C3&#8208;Cyanation of Pyridines: Constraints on Electrophiles and Determinants of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines was accomplished by a tandem process of borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration, substitution of the resulting dihydropyridine with a cyano electrophile, and finally oxidative aromatization. This method was suitable for use in late&#8208;stage cyanation of pyridine drugs.







Abstract
Methods for C&#8722;H cyanation of pyridines are rare. Here, we report a method for C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines by a tandem process with the reaction of an in situ generated dihydropyridine with a cyano electrophile as the key step. The method is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine drugs. The low reduction potential of the electrophile and effective transfer of the nitrile group were found to be essential for the success of this method. We studied the reaction mechanism in detail by means of control experiments and theoretical calculations and found that a combination of electronic and steric factors determined the regioselectivity of reactions involving C2&#8208;substituted pyridines.

         <title>Controlled Construction of Heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)]4+ Cages: A Facile Approach for Site&#8208;Selective endo&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)] supramolecular cages were selectively constructed by taking advantage of a pair of orthogonal steric control elements encoded in distinct ligands. This strategy allows the site&#8208;selective introduction of distinct endo&#8208;functionalities into the cavity of the heteroleptic cage.







Abstract
Construction of supramolecular structures with internal functionalities is a promising approach to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities. The endo&#8208;functionalized [Pd12L24] and [Pd2L4] coordination cages represent the most successful systems in this regard. However, these systems mainly contain one type of endo&#8208;moiety. We herein provide a solution for the controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of [Pd2L4] cages. Site&#8208;selective introduction of the endo&#8208;functional group was achieved through the formation of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)] cages. Using two orthogonal steric control elements is the key for the selective formation of the hetero&#8208;assemblies. We demonstrated the construction of two hetero&#8208;cages with a single internal functional group as well as a hetero&#8208;cage with two distinct endohedral functionalities. The endo&#8208;functionalized hetero&#8208;cages bound sulfonate guests with fast&#8208;exchange dynamics. This strategy provides a new solution for the controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities.

         <title>Single&#8208;Shot Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Full&#8208;Length H2 Relaxin Disulfide Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insulin family proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge (DADA) at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be very easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis. These new insulin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of insulin superfamily proteins (ISPs) has recently been widely studied to develop next&#8208;generation drugs. Separate synthesis of multiple peptide fragments and tedious chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain folding are usually encountered in these studies, limiting accessibility to ISP derivatives. Here we report the finding that insulin superfamily proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis and expedient one&#8208;step folding. Our new H2 relaxin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts. This new synthetic strategy will expediate production of new ISP analogues for pharmaceutical studies.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Vinylphosphonates and Diarylvinylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using H2 was developed, affording chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee and 1000&#8197;S/C (substrate/catalyst). The calculation and experimental mechanism study indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the product originate from H2 and the reaction proceeds through a NiII rather than Ni0 cyclic process.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted ethylphosphonate and ethylphosphine oxide compounds are widely used in drugs, pesticides, and ligands. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis is still rare. Of the only asymmetric hydrogenation methods available at present, all cases use rare metal catalysts. Herein, we report an efficient earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal nickel catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation affording the corresponding chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99&#8201;% ee, after recrystallization) and 1000&#8197;S/C (substrate/catalyst); this is also the first study on the asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using a nickel catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and calculations which indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the products come from hydrogen gas. Additionally, it is believed that the reaction involves a NiII rather than Ni0 cyclic process based on the weak attractive interactions between the Ni catalyst and terminal olefin substrate.

         <dc:description>
An universal strategy was proposed to develop red multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters by introducing auxiliary donor and acceptor moieties into the HOMO and LUMO distributed positions of B,N&#8208;containing multiple resonance skeleton simultaneously. The solution&#8208;processable pure&#8208;red OLED exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;%, high color purity and good operational lifetime.







Abstract
Developing solution&#8208;processable red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and efficiency based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) is a formidable challenge. Herein, by introducing auxiliary electron donor and acceptor moieties into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributed positions of multiple resonance skeleton simultaneously, an effective strategy to obtain red MR&#8208;TADF emitters was represented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule BN&#8208;R exhibits a narrowband pure&#8208;red emission at 624&#8197;nm, with a high luminous efficiency of 94&#8201;% and a narrow bandwidth of 46&#8197;nm. Notably, the fabricated solution&#8208;processable pure&#8208;red OLED based on BN&#8208;R exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;% with the Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.663, 0.337) and a long operational lifetime (LT50) of 1088&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Aerobic C&#8722;N Bond Formation through Enzymatic Nitroso&#8208;Ene&#8208;Type Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an exciting case of catalytic promiscuity, peroxidases and laccases participate in C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions through the generation of reactive nitroso intermediates from acylated hydroxylamines. The formal allylic C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds with air as the terminal oxidant and provides high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular amination reactions through this unprecedented biocatalytic nitroso&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction pathway.







Abstract
The biocatalytic oxidation of acylated hydroxylamines enables the direct and selective introduction of nitrogen functionalities by activation of allylic C&#8722;H bonds. Utilizing either laccases or an oxidase/peroxidase couple for the formal dehydrogenation of N&#8208;hydroxycarbamates and hydroxamic acids with air as the terminal oxidant, acylnitroso species are generated under particularly mild aqueous conditions. The reactive intermediates undergo C&#8722;N bond formation through an ene&#8208;type mechanism and provide high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular enzymatic aminations. Investigations on different pathways of the two biocatalytic systems and labelling studies provide more insight into this unprecedented promiscuity of classical oxidoreductases as catalysts for nitroso&#8208;based transformations.

The formal allylic C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds with air as the terminal oxidant and provides high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular amination reactions through this unprecedented biocatalytic nitroso-ene-type reaction pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biocatalytic oxidation of acylated hydroxylamines enables the direct and selective introduction of nitrogen functionalities by activation of allylic C&#8722;H bonds. Utilizing either laccases or an oxidase/peroxidase couple for the formal dehydrogenation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxycarbamates and hydroxamic acids with air as the terminal oxidant, acylnitroso species are generated under particularly mild aqueous conditions. The reactive intermediates undergo C&#8722;N bond formation through an ene-type mechanism and provide high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular enzymatic aminations. Investigations on different pathways of the two biocatalytic systems and labelling studies provide more insight into this unprecedented promiscuity of classical oxidoreductases as catalysts for nitroso-based transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Enantioselective Addition of a Silicon Nucleophile to 3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;Azirines Using an Si&#8722;B Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of C&#8208;silylated, unprotected aziridines has been accomplished. Using a silyl boronic ester as a latent silicon nucleophile, a chiral copper catalyst enables its addition of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;azirines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. These azirines can be considered strained cyclic and hence reactive ketimines, for which an effective silylation is still not known.







Abstract
3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;azirines can be considered strained cyclic ketimines, and highly enantioselective addition reactions of silicon nucleophiles to either acyclic or cyclic ketimines have been elusive so far. The present work closes this gap for those azirines by means of a copper&#8208;catalyzed silylation using a silyl boronic ester as a latent silicon nucleophile. The resulting C&#8208;silylated, unprotected (N&#8722;H) aziridines are obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities and can be further converted into valuable compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Stiffness&#8208;Transformable Nanoplatforms Responsive to the Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Tumor Therapeutic Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stiffness&#8208;transformable nanoplatforms in response to a simulated tumor microenvironment (TME) were designed. The nanoplatforms maintain quasi&#8208;spherical shape in normal physiological conditions, which effectively reduces macrophage uptake and nonspecific liver/spleen distributions, and transform to soft nanocapsules in a TME, thus enhancing tumor penetration, cellular uptake and tumor accumulation.







Abstract
Herein, we report, for the first time, a unique stiffness&#8208;transformable manganese oxide hybridized mesoporous organosilica nanoplatform (MMON) for enhancing tumor therapeutic efficacy. The prepared MMONs had a quasi&#8208;spherical morphology and were completely transformed into soft bowl&#8208;like nanocapsules in the simulated tumor microenvironment through the breakage of Mn&#8722;O bonds, which decreased their Young's modulus from 165.7 to 84.5&#8197;MPa. Due to their unique stiffness transformation properties, the MMONs had reduced macrophage internalization, improved tumor cell uptake, and enhanced penetration of multicellular spheroids. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that the MMONs displayed a 3.79&#8208; and 2.90&#8208;fold decrease in non&#8208;specific liver distribution and a 2.87&#8208; and 1.83&#8208;fold increase in tumor accumulation compared to their soft and stiff counterparts, respectively. Furthermore, chlorin e6 (Ce6) modified MMONs had significantly improved photodynamic therapeutic effect.

         <title>Giant Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Based Inorganic Molecular Tweezers: Metal Recognitions, Ion&#8208;Exchange Interactions and Mechanism Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The twelve {Nb6} units on the surface of a giant polyoxoniobate cluster can function as six pairs of polyoxoniobate&#8208;based inorganic molecular tweezers with unique C2v&#8208;symmetry binding cavities. They exhibit selective metal&#8208;uptake behaviours.







Abstract
This work reports the interesting and unique cation&#8208;exchange behaviors of the first indium&#8208;bridged purely inorganic 3D framework based on high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxoniobates as building units. Each nanoscale polyoxoniobate features a fascinating near&#8208;icosahedral core&#8211;shell structure with six pairs of unique inorganic &#8220;molecular tweezers&#8221; that have changeable openings for binding different metal cations via ion&#8208;exchanges and exhibit unusual selective metal&#8208;uptake behaviors. Further, the material has high chemical stability so that can undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal metal&#8208;exchange processes to produce a dozen new crystals with high crystallinity. Based on these crystals and time&#8208;dependent metal&#8208;exchange experiments, we can visually reveal the detailed metal&#8208;exchange interactions and mechanisms of the material at the atomic precision level. This work demonstrates a rare systematic and atomic&#8208;level study on the ion&#8208;exchange properties of nanoclusters, which is of significance for the exploration of cluster&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange materials that are still to be developed.

         <title>Stable Operation of Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries in Air Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of aqueous organic redox flow batteries were operated in an insert atmosphere because the reduced organic molecules in anolyte were sensitive to oxygen. We propose a strategy for it by using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte to balance oxygen reduction reaction in anolyte. Just with a trace OER catalyst layer (Ni(OH)2) on the surface of current collector for catholyte, the flow cell shows excellent stability in air atmosphere.







Abstract
As a green route for large&#8208;scale energy storage, aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported AORFBs were operated in an inert atmosphere. Herein, we clarify this issue by using the reported AORFB (i.e., 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;(9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;methylbutanoicacid) (DPivOHAQ)||Ferrocyanide) as an example. We demonstrate that the dissolved O2 can oxidize the discharged DPivOHAQ in anolyte, leading to capacity&#8208;imbalance between anolyte and catholyte. Therefore, this cell shows continuous capacity fading when operated in an air atmosphere. We propose a simple strategy for this challenge, in which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte is employed to balance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anolyte. When using the Ni(OH)2&#8208;modifed carbon felt (CF) as a current collector for catholyte, this cell shows an excellent stability in air atmosphere because the Ni(OH)2&#8208;induced OER capacity in catholyte exactly balances the ORR capacity in anolyte. Such O2&#8208;balance strategy facilitates AORFBs&#8217; practical application.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Dioxaphosphorane&#8208;Fused Diphosphacycles Exhibiting Unique Dynamic Fluorescence &#8220;On/Off&#8221; Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing mechanism.







Abstract
Rigidly planar polycyclic phosphacycles featuring an internal dioxaphosphorane are promising photofunctional materials. However, the lack of efficient synthetic methods resulted in limited structural diversities which significantly hampered extensive study. Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Control experiments and theory calculations were performed to account for a plausible reaction mechanism. We also systematically investigated the structure&#8208;property relationships of these unprecedented platforms by combining experiments (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical computations. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing process.

Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring-opening/ring-closing process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Approach for Constructing High&#8208;Density Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Overall Water Splitting at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a catalyst containing high&#8208;density Pt and Ir single atoms anchored on Co(OH)2 was prepared by a one&#8208;step approach, and required only 4 and 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, close to the world record level. Mechanistic studies revealed that reconstructed Ir&#8722;O6 single atoms and remodeled Pt triple&#8208;atom sites play key roles in water splitting. Finally, 20 other single&#8208;atom catalysts were synthesized by this approach.







Abstract
The construction of highly active, durable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is urgently needed for green hydrogen production. Herein, catalysts consisting of high&#8208;density Pt (24&#8197;atoms&#8201;nm&#8722;2) and Ir (32&#8197;atoms&#8201;nm&#8722;2) single atoms anchored on Co(OH)2 were constructed by a facile one&#8208;step approach. Remarkably, Pt1/Co(OH)2 and Ir1/Co(OH)2 only required 4 and 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, the assembled Pt1/Co(OH)2//Ir1/Co(OH)2 system showed mass activity of 4.9&#8197;A&#8201;mgnoble&#8201;metal&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;V in an alkaline water electrolyzer, which is 316.1 times higher than that of Pt/C//IrO2. Mechanistic studies revealed that reconstructed Ir&#8722;O6 single atoms and remodeled Pt triple&#8208;atom sites enhanced the occupancy of Ir&#8722;O bonding orbitals and improved the occupation of Pt&#8722;H antibonding orbital, respectively, contributing to the formation of the O&#8722;O bond and the desorption of hydrogen. This one&#8208;step approach was also generalized to fabricate other 20 single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Machine Learning for Understanding Surface Structures of Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous catalytic reactions occur at the surface of catalysts. The catalyst surface structure is highly complex and changes with reaction conditions and surrounding micro&#8208;environment. This Minireviewsummarizes recent progress in using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data&#8208;driven machine&#8208;learning (ML) to accelerate the research in heterogeneous catalyst surface by assisting catalysis experiments, in&#8208;situ characterizations, and operando computational simulations.







Abstract
The design of heterogeneous catalysts is necessarily surface&#8208;focused, generally achieved via optimization of adsorption energy and microkinetic modelling. A prerequisite is to ensure the adsorption energy is physically meaningful is the stable existence of the conceived active&#8208;site structure on the surface. The development of improved understanding of the catalyst surface, however, is challenging practically because of the complex nature of dynamic surface formation and evolution under in&#8208;situ reactions. We propose therefore data&#8208;driven machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches as a solution. In this Minireview we summarize recent progress in using machine&#8208;learning to search and predict (meta)stable structures, assist operando simulation under reaction conditions and micro&#8208;environments, and critically analyze experimental characterization data. We conclude that ML will become the new norm to lower costs associated with discovery and design of optimal heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>A Fluorogenic Inhibitor of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuOCou is a novel fluorogenic inhibitor of the mitochondria calcium uniporter (MCU). Its aquation&#8208;activated increase in MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity can be visualized directly by a concomitant enhancement in fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Inhibitors of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) are valuable tools for studying the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in various pathophysiological conditions. In this study, a new fluorogenic MCU inhibitor, RuOCou, is presented. This compound is an analogue of the known MCU inhibitor Ru265 that contains fluorescent axial coumarin carboxylate ligands. Upon aquation of RuOCou and release of the axial coumarin ligands, a simultaneous increase in its MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity and fluorescence intensity is observed. The fluorescence response of this compound enabled its aquation to be monitored in both HeLa cell lysates and live HeLa cells. This fluorogenic prodrug represents a potential theranostic MCU inhibitor that can be leveraged for the treatment of human diseases related to MCU activity.

         <title>Reversible Handedness Inversion and Circularly Polarized Light Reflection Tuning in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Macrocyclic Chiral Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized macrocyclic chiral photoswitches are capable of reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) in liquid crystals and diverse HTP changes upon photoisomerization. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven handedness inversion of the self&#8208;assembled helical superstructures.







Abstract
A series of macrocyclic azobenzene&#8208;based chiral photoswitches have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and characterized. In the molecular structures, binaphthyl is covalently linked to ortho&#8208;positions of azobenzene, and four different substituents are linked to 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of binaphthyl. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) when doping in commercially available achiral liquid crystals to form self&#8208;organized helical superstructures, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). All the photoswitches exhibit reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light of different wavelengths in both organic solvent and liquid crystals. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable handedness inversion of CLCs upon photoisomerization. These are the first examples of ortho&#8208;linked azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches that enable handedness inversion in CLCs. The photoswitches with longer substituents display only HTP values decreasing while maintaining the same handedness.

         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase synthesis of 9H&#8208;fluorene (C13H10)&#8212;the simplest polycyclic aromatic system carrying a five&#8208;membered ring&#8212;along with diphenylmethane (C13H12) via unconventional reaction dynamics of the benzyl (C7H7&#8901;) with the phenyl (C6H5&#8901;) radical is reported.







Abstract
The simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carrying a five&#8208;membered ring&#8212;9H&#8208;fluorene (C13H10)&#8212;is produced isomer&#8208;specifically in the gas phase by reacting benzyl (C7H7&#8901;) with phenyl (C6H5&#8901;) radicals in a pyrolytic reactor coupled with single photon ionization mass spectrometry. The unconventional mechanism of reaction is supported by theoretical calculations, which first produces diphenylmethane and unexpected 1&#8208;(6&#8208;methylenecyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienyl)benzene intermediates (C13H12) accessed via addition of the phenyl radical to the ortho position of the benzyl radical. These findings offer convincing evidence for molecular mass growth processes defying conventional wisdom that radical&#8208;radical reactions are initiated through recombination at their radical centers. The structure of 9H&#8208;fluorene acts as a molecular building block for complex curved nanostructures like fullerenes and nanobowls providing fundamental insights into the hydrocarbon evolution in high temperature settings.

&lt;p&gt;The simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carrying a five-membered ring&#8212;9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluorene (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8212;is produced isomer-specifically in the gas phase by reacting benzyl (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) with phenyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) radicals in a pyrolytic reactor coupled with single photon ionization mass spectrometry. The unconventional mechanism of reaction is supported by theoretical calculations, which first produces diphenylmethane and unexpected 1-(6-methylenecyclohexa-2,4-dienyl)benzene intermediates (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) accessed via addition of the phenyl radical to the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; position of the benzyl radical. These findings offer convincing evidence for molecular mass growth processes defying conventional wisdom that radical-radical reactions are initiated through recombination at their radical centers. The structure of 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluorene acts as a molecular building block for complex curved nanostructures like fullerenes and nanobowls providing fundamental insights into the hydrocarbon evolution in high temperature settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Near&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence from Functionalized Lead&#8208;Free Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient thermally&#8208;activated delayed near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence has been achieved in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2&#8208;based nanocrystals surface&#8208;functionalized with tetracene ligands, prolonging the exciton lifetime to 60&#8197;&#956;s at room temperature. Such long&#8208;lived near&#8208;infrared emission may find an array of applications.







Abstract
As an analogue to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of organic molecules, thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) observed in molecule&#8208;functionalized semiconductor nanocrystals represents an exotic mechanism to harvest energy from dark molecular triplets and to obtain controllable, long&#8208;lived PL from nanocrystals. The reported TADPL systems have successfully covered the visible spectrum. However, TADF molecules already emit very efficiently in the visible, diminishing the technological impact of the less&#8208;efficient nanocrystal&#8208;molecule TADPL. Here we report bright, near&#8208;infrared TADPL in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2 nanocrystals functionalized with carboxylated tetracene ligands, which results from efficient triplet energy transfer from photoexcited nanocrystals to ligands, followed with thermally activated reverse energy transfer from ligand triplets back to nanocrystals. This strategy prolonged the nanocrystal exciton lifetime from 100&#8197;ns to 60&#8197;&#956;s at room temperature.

         <title>Designed Iron Catalysts for Allylic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Propylene and Simple Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propylene gas is produced worldwide by steam cracking on million&#8208;metric&#8208;ton scale per year. It serves as a valuable starting material for &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization but is rarely applied in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed&#160;allylic C&#8722;H functionalization for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we report that a newly&#8208;developed cationic cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex allows for the conversion of propylene to its allylic C&#8722;C bond coupling products&#160;under catalytic conditions. This approach was also found applicable to the allylic functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;olefins with distinctive branched selectivity.&#160;Experimental and computational mechanistic studies supported the allylic deprotonation of the metal&#8208;coordinated alkene as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and led to insights into the multifaced roles of the newly designed ligand in promoting allylic C&#8722;H functionalization with enhanced reactivity and stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Rise of Trichlorides Enabling an Improved Chlorine Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorine plays a central role for the industrial production of numerous materials with global relevance. More recently, polychlorides have been evolved from an area of academic interest to a research topic with enormous industrial potential. In this minireview, the value of trichlorides for chlorine storage and chlorination reactions are outlined. Particularly, the inexpensive ionic liquid [NEt3Me][Cl3] shows a similar and sometimes even advantageous reactivity compared to chlorine gas, while offering a superior safety profile. Used as a chlorine storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3] could help to overcome the current limitations of storing and transporting chlorine in larger quantities. Thus, trichlorides could become a key technique for the flexibilization of the chlorine production enabling an exploitation of renewable, yet fluctuating, electrical energy. As the loaded storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3], is a proven chlorination reagent, it could directly be employed for downstream processes, paving the path to a more practical and safer chlorine industry.</dc:description>

We achieve multiplex digital detection with sub&#8208;attomolar sensitivity in 20 minutes, robust selectivity for single nucleotide variants, and a broad dynamic range from 1 aM to 1 pM.

         <title>Designing High&#8208;Donicity Anions for Rechargeable Potassium Superoxide/Peroxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A battery cathode based on the superoxide/peroxide redox not only inherits the advantage of oxygen (O  2  ) batteries in high capacities and low costs but also overcomes the disadvantages in O  2  storage, electrolyte evaporation, and anode deactivation due to O  2  crossover. Herein, we report an enhanced potassium superoxide (KO  2  )/peroxide (K  2  O  2  ) conversion by adopting a high&#8208;donicity anion additive in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Such an anion was synthesized via a &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; strategy and validated to enhance the electron donicity of the electrolyte. The use of highdonicity anion could lead to enhanced KO  2  utilization (~90.2%) by retarding electrode passivation and allow the full charging back of K  2  O  2  through the solution&#8208;mediated pathway without electrocatalysts. No apparent cell degradation is observed during the first 120 cycles by controlling the reversible depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge capacity at 292 mAh g  &#8208;1  KO2  within an O  2  &#8208;free region. The K&#8208;KO  2  cell delivers a high energy efficiency (&gt;84.4%) and a lifespan of over 1440 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron spin catalysis with graphene belts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report kinetic studies using electron spin resonance spectroscopy on spin catalysis reactions caused by using graphene belts which were synthesized by a radical coupling method. The results show that s&#8208;type free radical species provide the dominant sites for catalytic activity through the spin&#8208;spin interaction, although there are some other influencing factors. The spin catalysis mechanism can be applied both in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in organic synthesis. The graphene belt spin catalyst shows excellent performance with a high ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81 V and long&#8208;term stability with almost no loss of activity after 50,000 cycles in alkaline media. It also shows excellent performance in a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine at an average conversion of ~97.7 % and an average yield of ~97.9 %. This work opens up a new research direction for understanding aerobic processes in the field of spin catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Reveals High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry&#8208;based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H2O2 modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H2O2 in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal engineering has, so far, exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer significantly enhances its thermal stability without compromising its mechanical flexibility, while isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a practically wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Chemistries Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs) are deemed as promising technologies for electrochemical energy storage due to their high safety, low cost and high energy density. However, AZMBs still suffer from severe side reactions, including Zn dendrite formation and intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast to the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that stabilizes Li/Na/K metal anodes in organic electrolytes, it is difficult to form an SEI layer on the Zn surface because of the difficulty in decomposing the salt anions within the narrow electrochemical potential window of water. A team from the University of Adelaide reported a novel pure or hybrid electrolyte with H2O by using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvent or co&#8208;solvent to construct a uniform and stable phosphate&#8208;based SEI layer (ZnP2O6 and Zn3(PO4)2). Thus, high Coulombic efficiencies and improved capacity retentions can be obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations Guide Chimeragenesis and Engineered Control of Chemoselectivity in Diketopiperazine Dimerases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the biosynthesis of the tryptophan&#8208;linked dimeric diketopiperazines (DKPs), cytochromes P450 selectively couple DKP monomers to generate a variety of intricate and isomeric frameworks. To determine the molecular basis for selectivity of these biocatalysts we obtained a high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of selective Csp2&#8211;N bond forming dimerase, AspB. Overlay of the AspB structure onto C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond forming homolog NzeB revealed no significant structural variance to explain their divergent chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified a region of NzeB with increased conformational flexibility relative to AspB, and interchange of this region along with a single active site mutation led to a variant that catalyzes exclusive C&#8211;N bond formation. MD simulations also suggest that intermolecular C&#8211;C or C&#8211;N bond formation results from a change in mechanism, supported experimentally through use of a substrate mimic.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of Polymeric Nanorods Mediated by Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing a second component is an effective way to manipulate polymerization behaviors. However, this phenomenon has rarely been observed in colloidal systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles. Here, we report the supramolecular polymerization of polymeric nanorods mediated by block copolymers. Experimental observations and simulation results illustrate that block copolymers surround the polymeric nanorods and mainly concentrate around the two ends, leaving the hydrophobic side regions exposed. These polymeric nanorods connect in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side manner through hydrophobic interactions to form bundles. As polymerization progresses, the block copolymers gradually deposit onto the bundles and finally assemble into helical nanopatterns on the outermost surface, which terminates the polymerization. It is anticipated that this work could offer inspiration for a general strategy of controllable supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed Disulfide&#8208;mediated Reversible Polymerization for Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(1,2&#8208;dithiolane)s are a family of intrinsically recyclable polymers due to their dynamic covalent disulfide linkages. Despite the common use of thiolate&#8208;initiated anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) under basic condition, cationic ROP is still not exploited. Here we report that disulfide bond can act as a proton acceptor, being protonated by acids to form sulfonium cations, which can efficiently initiate the ROP of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes and result in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (over 1000 kDa) poly(disulfide)s. The reaction can be triggered by adding catalytic amounts of acids and non&#8208;coordinating anion salts, and completed in few minutes at room temperature. The acidic conditions allow the applicability for acidic monomers. Importantly, the reaction condition can be under open air without inert protection, enabling the nearly quantitative chemical recycling from bulk materials to original monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Nanosensitizers for Activatable Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Tumors by Redox&#8208;Controlled Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;targeted and stimuli&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers are highly desirable for cancer theranostics. However, design of smart nanosensitizers with multiple imaging signals and synergistic therapeutic activities switched on is challenging. Herein, we report tumor&#8208;targeted and redox&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) for sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of tumors by molecular co&#8208;assembly and redox&#8208;controlled disassembly. 1&#8208;NPs show a high longitudinal relaxivity (r1 = 18.7 &#177; 0.3 mM&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), but &#8220;off&#8221; dual fluorescence (FL) emissions (at 547 and 672 nm), &#8220;off&#8221; sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibition activities. Upon reduction by glutathione (GSH), 1&#8208;NPs rapidly disassemble and remotely release small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919, concurrently switching on (1) dual FL emissions, (2) sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and (3) IDO1 inhibition activities. After systemic injection, 1&#8208;NPs are effective for bimodal FL and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotropic breast and brain tumors in mice under combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Induced Multichromism of Phenanthridine Derivatives: A Type of Versatile Fluorescent Probe for Microenvironmental Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes are attractive in diagnosis and sensing. However, most reported fluorophores can only detect one or few analytes/parameters, notably limiting their applications. Here we have designed three phenanthridine&#8208;based fluorophores (i.e., B1, F1, and T1 with 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular configuration, respectively) capable of monitoring various microenvironments. In rigidifying mediums, all fluorophores show bathochromic emissions but with different wavelength and intensity changes. Under compression, F1 shows over 163 nm bathochromic emission, resulting in an organic fluorophore&#8208;based full&#8208;color piezochromism. Moreover, both B1 and F1 exhibit an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) behavior, while T1 is an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore. Further, F1 and T1 selectively concentrate in cell nucleus, whereas B1 mainly stains the cytoplasm in live cell imaging. This work provides a general design strategy of versatile fluorophores for microenvironmental monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Coordination State Rh(I)&#8208;Complex as High Performance Catalyst for Asymmetric Intramolecular Cyclopropanation: Construction of penta&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system for challenging asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of various tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates was successfully developed. The low coordination state Rh(I)&#8208;complex exhibits an extraordinarily high degree of tolerance to the variation in the extent of substitution of the allyl double bond, thus allowing the efficient construction of a wide range of penta&#8208;substituted, fused&#8208;ring cyclopropanes bearing three contiguous stereogenic centers, including two quaternary carbon stereocenters, in a highly enantioselective manner with ease at catalyst loading as low as 0.1 mol%. The stereoinduction mode of this Rh(I)&#8208;carbene&#8208;directed asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation was investigated by DFT calculations, indicating that &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of chiral diene ligand and diazo substrate play a key role in the control of the reaction enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Amides Enabled by 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Bipyridine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8211;H bonds are highly attractive transformations owing to the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of meta and/or para positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF3 substituent at position 5, enables a complete alteration of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, providing for the synthesis of a wide variety of ortho&#8208;borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer&#8208;sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF3&#8211;substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Intense d&#8208;p Hybridization in Nb3O15 Tripolymer Induced the Largest Second Harmonic Generation Response and Birefringence in Germanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report two asymmetric germanate crystals, KNbGe3O9 and K3Nb3Ge2O13, with different structures and optical properties derived from divergent polymerized forms of GeO4 and NbO6 groups. Remarkably, K3Nb3Ge2O13 achieved a rare combination of the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 17.5&#215;KDP@1064nm and the largest birefringence of 0.196@546nm in germanates. It features unique [Nb3O12]&#8734; tubular chains constructed by circular Nb3O15 tripolymers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the d&#8208;p interactions in the Nb3O15 group are responsible for outstanding optical properties. This work emphasizes the significance of the polymerizable functional units in obtaining high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Deprotonative Functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethyl Ketones using a Catalytic Organosuperbase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deprotonative functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is described herein. Using a catalytic organosuperbase and a silane additive, the corresponding difluoroenolate could be generated and trapped with aldehydes to deliver various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones in high yields. This new strategy tolerates numerous functional groups and represents the access to the difluoroenolate by direct deprotonation of the difluoromethyl unit. The diastereoselective version of the reaction was also investigated with d.r. up to 93:7. Several transformations were performed to demonstrate the synthetic potential of these &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. In addition, this method has been extended to the use of other electrophiles such as imines and chalcogen derivatives, and a difluoromethyl sulfoxide as nucleophile, thus leading to a diversity of difluoromethylene compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Negative Hydrogen Production Strategy: CO2 Selective Capture with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure. For this purpose, carbonate&#8208;type CuxMgyFez layered double hydroxide (LDH) was preciously constructed, and then a photocatalysis reaction of interlayer CO32&#8208; reduction with glycerol oxidation was performed as driving force to induce the electron storage on LDH layers. With the participation of pre&#8208;stored electrons, CO2 was captured to recover interlayer CO32&#8208; in presence of H2O, accompanied with equivalent H2 production. During photocatalysis reaction, Cu0.6Mg1.4Fe1 exhibited a decent CO evolution amount of 1.63 mmol/g and dihydroxyacetone yield of 3.81 mmol/g. In carbon&#8208;negative H2 production process, it showed an exciting CO2 capture quantity of 1.61 mmol/g and H2 yield of 1.44 mmol/g. Besides, this system possessed stable operation capability under simulated flu gas condition with negligible performance loss, exhibiting application prospect.</dc:description>

         <title>Diradical B/N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic diradicaloids with atom&#8208;precise control over open&#8208;shell nature are promising materials for organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, we disclose quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension of a B/N&#8208;heterocycle for generating B/N&#8208;type organic diradicaloids. Two quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic hydrocarbons that feature fusion of the B/N&#8208;heterocycle motif with the antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene core were synthesized. This quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension and B/N&#8208;heterocycle leads to their open&#8208;shell electronic nature, which stands in contrast to the multiple&#8208;resonance effect of conventional B/N&#8208;type emitters. These B/N&#8208;type diradicaloids have modulated (anti)aromaticity and enhanced diradical characters comparing with the all&#8208;carbon analogues, as well as intriguing properties, such as magnetic activities, narrow energy gaps and highly red&#8208;shifted absorptions. This study thus opens the new space for both of B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems and heterocyclic diradicaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Nickel Thiolate Complexes for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to C1&#8722;3 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the unprecedented electrocatalytic activity of a series of molecular nickel thiolate complexes (1&#8722;5) in reducing CO2 to C1 &#8722; 3 hydrocarbons on carbon paper in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. Ni(mpo)2 (3, mpo = 2&#8208;mercaptopyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide), Ni(pyS)3&#8211; (4, pyS = 2&#8208;mercaptopyridine), and Ni(mp)2&#8211; (5, mp = 2&#8208;mercaptophenolate) were found to generate C3 products from CO2 for the first time in molecular complex. Compound 5 exhibits Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 10.6%, 7.2%, 8.2% for C1, C2, C3 hydrocarbons respectively at &#8722;1.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Addition of CO to the system significantly promotes the FEC1 &#8722; C3 to 41.1%, suggesting that a key Ni&#8722;CO intermediate is associated with catalysis. A variety of spectroscopies have been performed to show that the structures of nickel complexes remain intact during CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin CuF2&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Induced by Cation&#8208;Tailored Double Electrical Layer toward Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) seriously affects battery&#8217;s cycling life, especially for high&#8208;capacity anode due to excessive electrolyte decomposition from particle fracture. Herein, we report an ultrathin SEI (3&#8208;4 nm) induced by Cu+&#8208;tailored double electrical layer (EDL) to suppress electrolyte consumption and enhance cycling stability of CuS anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unique EDL with SO3CF3&#8208;Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, Cyro&#8208;TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO3CF3&#8208;Cu could be reduced to CuF2&#8208;rich SEI. Dispersed CuF2 and F&#8208;containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na+ transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 475 mAh g&#8208;1 after 7000 cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high&#8208;stability electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Changes of C&#8722;H Bond Lengths in Chiral Zinc Complexes Induced by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution neutron diffraction studies have been successfully performed on chiral complexes to observe C&#8722;H bond elongations and shortenings caused by three types of tetrel bonds (TBs) and a trifurcated improper hydrogen bond, respectively. This study helps to fundamentally understand uncommon and subtle C&#8722;H bond changes induced by weak interactions.







Abstract
In order to better understand the effect of non&#8208;covalent weak interactions on molecules, we have explored a variety of weak interactions, such as improper H&#8208;bonding (HB), tetrel bonds (TBs) and halogen bonds, in fluorinated chiral zinc complexes. High resolution neutron diffraction studies revealed a methylene carbon&#8208;hydrogen bond elongation and shortening due to TB and improper HB interactions, respectively. To show the accumulative effects of multiple weak interactions on the C&#8722;H bond, three types of tetrel bonds have been carefully examined. We have also shown how C&#8722;H bond elongation can be easily offset by forming an improper HB with the H atom from this C&#8722;H bond. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and electrostatic potential analysis investigations have been used to affirm the nature of the interactions based on density functional theory (DFT) and other related calculations.

To show the accumulative effects of multiple weak interactions on the C&#8722;H bond, three types of tetrel bonds have been carefully examined. We have also shown how C&#8722;H bond elongation can be easily offset by forming an improper HB with the H atom from this C&#8722;H bond. Non-covalent interaction and electrostatic potential analysis investigations have been used to affirm the nature of the interactions based on density functional theory (DFT) and other related calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Persicamidines&#8212;Unprecedented Sesquarterpenoids with Potent Antiviral Bioactivity against Coronaviruses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of highly unusual terpenoids (persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E) was isolated. Extensive NMR analysis unraveled a hexacyclic terpenoid with a modified sugar and a highly unusual isourea moiety. Persicamidines showed potent antiviral activity. Each displayed single&#8208;digit nanomolar activity against hCoV&#8208;229E, comparable to that of remdesivir. Particularly Persicamidine&#8197;C was a very potent inhibitor of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with an IC50 value of 74&#8197;nM.







Abstract
A new family of highly unusual sesquarterpenoids (persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E) exhibiting significant antiviral activity was isolated from a newly discovered actinobacterial strain, Kibdelosporangium persicum sp. nov., collected from a hot desert in Iran. Extensive NMR analysis unraveled a hexacyclic terpenoid molecule with a modified sugar moiety on one side and a highly unusual isourea moiety fused to the terpenoid structure. The structures of the five analogues differed only in the aminoalkyl side chain attached to the isourea moiety. Persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E showed potent activity against hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses in the nanomolar range together with very good selectivity indices, making persicamidines promising as starting points for drug development.

         <title>The Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric version of the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction has been developed as a powerful asymmetric&#8208;catalysis tool bolstered by the great success of its achiral version in the pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis fields. This review showcases research into the use of the asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction for constructing centered, axial, and planar chiralities. A brief overview of the chemistry is also provided based on this research.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction has emerged as a powerful tool for forging C&#8722;N bonds, and has been vital to the pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis fields. However, asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination reactions for constructing centered chirality, planar chirality, and axial chirality remain in their infancy owing to limited substrate scope and laggard ligand design. The recent surge in interest in the synthesis of C&#8722;N/N&#8722;N atropisomers, has witnessed a renaissance in asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination chemistry as the first practical protocol for the preparation of C&#8722;N atropisomers. This review highlights reported asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination protocols and provides a brief overview of their chemical practicality.

         <title>Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalysis Manipulated Sulfur Speciation Pathway for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Na&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis facilitates successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas porous Fe2O3 core serves as the main reactor and accelerates long&#8208;chain Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe(CN)64&#8722;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell functions as physical barrier and catalyzes confined short&#8208;chain Na2S4 reduction to final Na2S inside the nanopores.







Abstract
The sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics and the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway, leading to serious shuttling effect and high activation barrier associated with sulfur cathode. We describe here the use of core&#8211;shell structured composite matrixes containing abundant catalytic sites for nearly fully reversible cycling of sulfur cathodes for Na&#8208;S batteries. The bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis provide successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas Fe2O3 accelerates Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe(CN)64&#8722;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell catalyzes Na2S4 reduction to Na2S. The electrochemically reactive Na2S can be readily charged back to sulfur with minimal overpotential. Simultaneously, stable cycling of Na&#8208;S pouch cell with a high reversible capacity of 696&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is also demonstrated. The bidirectional confined tandem catalysis renders the manipulation of sulfur redox electrochemistry for practical Na&#8208;S cells.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defined reticular lattice, precise structure of the active sites and the wide range of transition metals make MOF composites promising candidates as advanced electrocatalysts for a variety of reactions. However, electrical conductivity and stability issues are two main drawbacks that hinder their wide applicability at high current densities. The various strategies to circumvent the bottlenecks are described.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes are well&#8208;known homogeneous electrocatalysts. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be considered as an ensemble of transition metal complexes ordered in a periodic arrangement. In addition, MOFs have several additional positive structural features that make them suitable for electrocatalysis, including large surface area, high porosity, and high content of accessible transition metal with exchangeable coordination positions. The present review describes the current state in the use of MOFs as electrocatalysts, both as host of electroactive guests and their direct electrocatalytic activity, particularly in the case of bimetallic MOFs. The field of MOF&#8208;derived materials is purposely not covered, focusing on the direct use of MOFs or its composites as electrocatalysts. Special attention has been paid to present strategies to overcome their poor electrical conductivity and limited stability.

         <title>Planar Chiral Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two efficient planar chiral multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent compounds showing narrow emissions and circularly polarized luminescence were prepared. The sky&#8208;blue circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diode exhibited the narrowest emission and high external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;%, and the first nearly pure green circularly polarized electroluminescence was realized. Both devices display g factors at 10&#8722;3 level.







Abstract
Chiral boron/nitrogen doped multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for highly efficient and color&#8208;pure circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Herein, we report two pairs of MR&#8208;TADF materials (Czp&#8208;tBuCzB, Czp&#8208;POAB) based on planar chiral paracyclophane with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The enantiomers showed symmetric circularly polarized photoluminescence spectra with dissymmetry factors |gPL| of up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;3 in doped films. Meanwhile, the sky&#8208;blue CP&#8208;OLEDs with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;tBuCzB showed an external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;% with the narrowest full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 24&#8197;nm among the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs, while the devices with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;POAB displayed the first nearly pure green CP electroluminescence with |gEL| factors at the 10&#8722;3 level. These results demonstrate the incorporation of planar chirality into MR&#8208;TADF emitter is a reliable strategy for constructing of efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

The sky-blue circularly polarized organic light-emitting diode exhibited the narrowest emission and high external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;%, and the first nearly pure green circularly polarized electroluminescence was realized. Both devices display &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; factors at 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral boron/nitrogen doped multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters are promising for highly efficient and color-pure circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs). Herein, we report two pairs of MR-TADF materials (Czp-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuCzB, Czp-POAB) based on planar chiral paracyclophane with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The enantiomers showed symmetric circularly polarized photoluminescence spectra with dissymmetry factors |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;| of up to 1.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; in doped films. Meanwhile, the sky-blue CP-OLEDs with (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Czp-tBuCzB showed an external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;% with the narrowest full-width at half-maximum of 24&#8197;nm among the reported CP-OLEDs, while the devices with (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Czp-POAB displayed the first nearly pure green CP electroluminescence with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| factors at the 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; level. These results demonstrate the incorporation of planar chirality into MR-TADF emitter is a reliable strategy for constructing of efficient CP-OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed [4 + 2] Reaction: A New Elementary Reaction Suggested for Future Reaction Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here computational evidence for a metalla&#8208;Claisen rearrangement (MCR) in the case of gold&#8208;catalyzed [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of yne&#8208;dienes. The [4 + 2] reaction starts from exo cyclopropanation, followed by MCR and reductive elimination. The cyclopropane moiety formed in the first step is crucial for a low barrier of the MCR step. In addition, the importance of an appropriate combination of the tether group and the terminal substituent on alkyne in the yne&#8208;diene substrates was studied. The mechanism of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4 + 2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes was also investigated to see whether an MCR mechanism is involved or not. The findings and new understanding hereby reported represent an important advance in the catalysis field.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transient self&#8208;assembly of molecules under the direction of a consumable fuel source is fundamental to biological processes like cellular organization and motility. Such biomolecular assemblies exist in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state, requiring continuous consumption of high energy molecules. At the same time, the creation of bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels has traditionally focused on associations occurring at the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here, hydrogels are prepared from cucurbit[7]uril host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions through transient physical crosslinking driven by the consumption of a reactive chemical fuel. Upon action from this fuel, the affinity and dynamics of CB[7]&#8211;guest recognition are altered. In this way, the lifetime of transient hydrogel formation and the dynamic modulus obtained are governed by fuel consumption, rather than being directed by equilibrium complex formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin States in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and stable transition metal oxides catalysts for energy conversion processes such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction is one of the key measures to solve the problem of energy shortage. The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. In an octahedral structure of transition metal oxides, the spin state of active centers could be regulated by adjusting the splitting energy and the electron pairing energy. Regulating spin state of active centers could directly modulate the d orbitals occupancy, which influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. In this review, we clarified the significance of regulating spin state of the active centers. Subsequently, we discussed several characterization technologies for spin state and some recent strategies to regulate the spin state of the active centers. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoacoustic Probe with Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier Crossing Ability for Imaging Oxidative Stress Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal assessment of the oxidative stress dynamics in the brain is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing oxidative stress probes have poor blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability or poor penetration depth, making them unsuitable for brain imaging. Herein, we developed a photoacoustic probe that enables real&#8208;time imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain. The probe not only responds to oxidative stress in a reversible and ratiometric manner, but it can also cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier of the mouse brain. Notably, the probe displayed excellent photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease mouse models. In addition, we investigated the antioxidant properties of natural polyphenols in the brain of a Parkinson's disease mouse model using the probe as an imaging agent and suggested the potential of the probe for screening anti&#8208;oxidative stress agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,3&#8208;Chiral Centers via Tandem Asymmetric Conjugate Addition and Allylic Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a synthesis of cyclohexanones bearing multi&#8208;continuous stereocenters by combining copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to cyclic enones with iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction. Good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity can be obtained. Unlike the stereodivergent construction of adjacent stereocenters (1,2&#8208;position) reported in the literature, the current reaction can achieve the stereodivergent construction of nonadjacent stereocenters (1,3&#8208;position) by a proper combination of two chiral catalysts with different enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aerobic Environment on a Copper&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein,&#160;we fabricated a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: g&#8208;C3N4 and a Cu&#8208;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed. Structural analysis indicated that during aerobic pretreatment, the Cu node in the 2D&#8208;MOF moiety was hydroxylated by the hydroxyl generated from the reduction of O2.&#160;Then the formed hydroxylated Cu node maintained its structure during aerobic CO2 reduction, whereas it underwent structural alteration and was reductively devitalized in the absence of O2. Theoretical calculations further demonstrated that CO2 reduction, instead of O2 reduction, occurred preferentially on the hydroxylated Cu node.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized Sieving Effect for Ethanol/Water Separation by Ultramicroporous MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;purity ethanol is a promising renewable energy resource, however separating ethanol from trace amount of water is extremely challenging. Herein, two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) were used as adsorbents. A prominent water adsorption and a negligible ethanol adsorption identify perfect sieving effect on both MOFs. Co&#8208;squarate exhibits a surprising water adsorption capacity at low pressure that surpassing the reported MOFs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations reveal that such prominent performance of Co&#8208;squarate derives from the optimized sieving effect through pore structure adjustment. Co&#8208;squarate with larger rhombohedral channel is suitable for zigzag water location, resulting in reinforced guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. Ultrapure ethanol (99.9%) can be obtained directly by ethanol/water mixed vapor breaking through the columns packed with Co&#8208;squarate, contributing to a potential for fuel&#8208;grade ethanol purification.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208; and Proton&#8208;Driven Perylene Reactive Oxygen Species Super&#8208;Generator for Trimodal Therapy Against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as cytotoxic radicals to directly kill tumor cells and concurrently elicits immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect to well achieve the combined photodynamic immunotherapy. Thus motivated, we herein present one ROS super&#8208;generator PMIC&#8208;NC that not only arouses hypoxia&#8208;activated type&#8208;I ROS burst aided by proton transients but also triggers type&#8208;I/II ROS production by electron or energy transfer under near infrared light (NIR) irradiation as well as elicits strong ICD effect. More interesting, mitochondria&#8208; and lung&#8208;specific distribution of PMIC&#8208;NC also boosts the therapeutic efficiency towards cancer. As a result, PMIC&#8208;NC afforded NIR&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy and hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy as well as ICD&#8208;induced immunotherapy on primary tumor and pulmonary metastasis featured by 3.7&#8208;fold and 3&#8208;fold enhancement in efficiency compared to positive control Ce6 group. This work thus contributes the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of perylene as integrated theraputic platform that efficiently realize the synergistic trimodal anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Engineering of a Cage&#8208;like MOF Pore Aperture for the Efficient Separation of Isomeric C4 paraffins under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomeric C4 paraffins separation is an important task in petrochemical while current adsorbents undergo a trade&#8208;off relationship between selectivity and adsorption capacity. In this work, the pore aperture of a cage&#8208;like Zn&#8208;bzc (bzc = pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) is tuned by stepwisely installing methyl groups on its narrow aperture to achieve both molecular&#8208;sieving separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 uptake. Notably, the resulting Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 (bzc&#8208;2CH3 = 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) can sensitively capture n&#8208;C4H10 and exclude iso&#8208;C4H10, affording molecular&#8208;sieving n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity (54.3 cm3 g&#8208;1). Breakthrough test proves n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 can be efficiently separated and high&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (99.99%) can be collected. Importantly, the hydrophobic microenvironment created by the introduced methyl groups greatly improves the stability of Zn&#8208;bzc and significantly eliminates the negative effect of water vapor on gas separation under humid conditions, indicating Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 is a new benchmark for n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Reactivation of Dead Li2S for Li&#8208;S Batteries in Non&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of non&#8208;solvating, or as&#8208;called sparingly&#8208;solvating, electrolytes (NSEs), is regarded as one of the most promising solutions to the obstacles to the practical applications of Li&#8208;S batteries. However, it remains a puzzle that long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S batteries have rarely, if not never, been reported with NSEs, despite their good compatibility with Li anode. Here, we find the capacity decay of Li&#8208;S batteries in NSEs is mainly due to the accumulation of the dead Li2S at the cathode side, rather than the degradation of the anodes or electrolytes. Based on this understanding, we propose an electrochemical strategy to reactivate the accumulated Li2S and revive the dead Li&#8208;S batteries in NSEs. With such a facile approach, Li&#8208;S batteries with significantly improved cycling stability and accelerated dynamics are achieved with diglyme&#8208;, acetonitrile&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based NSEs. Our finding may rebuild the confidence in exploiting non&#8208;solvating Li&#8208;S batteries with practical competitiveness.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tri&#64258;uoromethyl&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered ring structures are prevalent in bioactive molecules, but modular approaches to these compounds by functionalization of robust sp3 hybridized C&#8211;H bonds in a direct and selective manner are extremely challenging. Herein we report the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene insertion into a broad range of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds to access 7 types of CF3&#8208;bearing saturated 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The reaction is particularly effective for benzylic C&#8211;H insertion exerting good site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, and applicable to access chiral CF3 analogues of bioactive molecules. Ruthenium&#8722;&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene complexes underwent stoichiometric reactions to give C&#8211;H insertion products, lending evidence for the involvement of metal&#8722;&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene species in the catalytic cycle.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) that use solid electrolytes instead of flammable liquid electrolytes have the potential to generate higher specific capacity and offer better safety. Magnesium (Mg) based SSBs with Mg metal anode are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage candidates, because it gives high theoretical volumetric capacities of 3830 mAh cm&#8208;3.

The proposed ALD strategy shows the ability of conformal deposition nitrogen&#8208;doped SSEs on pattered substrates and is attractive for using nitride ion&#8208;conducing films as protective or wetting interlayers in solid&#8208;state Mg and Li batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94% yield and 90:10 to &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Responsive Conjugates with Tunable Charge&#8208;Reversal Properties for Highly Efficient Tumor Accumulation and Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor enzyme&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal carriers can induce efficient transcytosis and lead to efficient tumor infiltration and potent anticancer efficacy. However, the correlations of molecular structure with charge&#8208;reversal property, tumor penetration, and drug delivery efficiency are unknown. Herein, aminopeptidase N (APN)&#8208;responsive conjugates were synthesized to investigate these correlations. We found that the monomeric unit structure and the polymer chain structure determined the enzymatic hydrolysis&#160;and charge&#8208;reversal rates, and accordingly, the transcytosis and tumor accumulation and penetration of the APN&#8208;responsive conjugates. The conjugate with moderate APN responsiveness balanced the in vitro transcytosis and in vivo overall drug delivery process and achieved the best tumor delivery efficiency, giving potent antitumor efficacy. This work provides new insight into the design of tumor enzyme&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanomedicines for efficient cancer drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Hybridization for Electro&#8208;reforming Waste Glycerol into Isolable Oxalate and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electro&#8208;reforming of glycerol is an emerging technology of simultaneous hydrogen production and biomass valorization. However, its complex reaction network and limited catalyst tunability restrict the precise steering toward high selectivity. Herein, we incorporated the chelating phenanthrolines into the bulk nickel hydroxide and tuned the electronic properties by installing functional groups, yielding tunable selectivity toward formate (max 92.7%) and oxalate (max 45.3%) with almost linear correlation with the Hammett parameters. Further combinatory study of intermediate analysis and various spectroscopic techniques revealed the electronic effect of tailoring the valence band that balances between C&#8208;C cleavage and oxidation through the key glycolaldehyde intermediate. A two&#8208;electrode electro&#8208;reforming setup using the 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;nickel hydroxide catalyst was further established to convert crude glycerol into pure H2 and isolable sodium oxalate with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allenes with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Adjacent Central Chiralities Empowered by Synergistic Pd/Cu Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodivergent synthesis of allene compounds bearing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;adjacent central chiralities has been realized via the Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric alkylation of racemic allenylic esters. The matched reactivity of bimetallic catalytic system enables the challenging reaction of racemic aryl&#8208;substituted allenylic acetates with sterically crowded aldimine esters smoothly under mild reaction conditions. Various chiral non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a terminal allenyl group are easily synthesized in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99% ee). Importantly, all four stereoisomers of the product can be readily accessed by switching the configurations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the easy interconversion between the uncommon &#951;3&#8208;butadienyl palladium intermediate featuring a weak C=C/Pd coordination bond and a stable Csp2&#8208;Pd bond is beneficial for the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process (DyKAT).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. Compared to the widely studied oxycarbene metal complexes bearing Group 6 metals, the synthetic and catalytic applications of oxycarbenes beyond Group 6 Fischer carbene complexes are less explored because of the difficulty in the control of their reactivity and the need to use stoichiometric amount of pre&#8208;synthesized Group 6 metal carbene complex as the starting material. This Minireview summarizes the early synthetic and catalytic applications of late transition metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes.

         <title>Electrochemical Kinetics Support a Second Coordination Sphere Mechanism in Metal&#8208;Based Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Mo/W formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) is debated because the metal ion of the active site is 6&#8208;coordinated, leaving no coordination site open for substrate binding. We have used direct electrochemistry to investigate the catalytic cycle of two homologous FDHs: our results strongly support a &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based formate dehydrogenases are molybdenum or tungsten&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between formate and CO2. According to the current consensus, the metal ion of the catalytic center in its active form is coordinated by 6&#8201;S (or 5&#8201;S and 1&#8201;Se) atoms, leaving no free coordination sites to which formate could bind to the metal. Some authors have proposed that one of the active site ligands decoordinates during turnover to allow formate binding. Another proposal is that the oxidation of formate takes place in the second coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we have used electrochemical steady&#8208;state kinetics to elucidate the order of the steps in the catalytic cycle of two formate dehydrogenases. Our results strongly support the &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; hypothesis.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction of CO2 over Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks: Hydrogen Bonding Effects of Halogen Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonding strategy for achieving high electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction performance over an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework (Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8722;X) is reported by Yuan&#8208;Biao Huang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215687). The halogen anions can form hydrogen bonds with intermediates (*COOH) and thus lower the energy barrier to the formation of CO. Moreover, the water&#8211;anion interactions can repel the contact of water with the active centers, thus inhibiting the occurrence of HER.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell&#8208;Free Biosensors for Antibody Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits which, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor, were designed by Sara Bracaglia, Simona Ranallo, and Francesco Ricci in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216512). The cell&#8208;free electrochemical biosensor allows the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum.

         <title>Electronic Control of the Scholl Reaction: Selective Synthesis of Spiro vs Helical Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different electronic effects on the starting anthracene&#8208;containing polyphenylene substrate (bottom) afford two different nanographenes under Scholl reaction conditions, namely, spironanographenes (R=H) on the left, and a helically arranged molecular nanographene having two orthogonal aromatic moieties linked by an octafluoroanthracene core (R=F) on the right. The different stability of the intermediate trityl cation and the concomitant gain of aromaticity decide the fate of the reaction, as explained by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Nazario Mart&#237;n et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215655).

         <title>Multilayered Ceramic Membrane with Ion Conducting Thin Layer Induced by Interface Reaction for Stable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are essential platforms for solid state electrochemical devices, gas separation membranes and sensors. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210485), Heqing Jiang et&#8197;al. develop a new interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of zirconia&#8208; or ceria&#8208;based dense thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes that show robust and practical performance for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen.

The DNA templated bio&#8208;orthogonal synthesis of macrocyclic gene modulators is illustrated in the cover picture accompanying the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215245) by Jyotirmayee Dash and co&#8208;workers. DNA secondary structures present in the telomere and oncogene promoter proximally orient bi&#8208;functional alkyne and azide fragments, enabling bond formation via Cu&#8208;free azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition in live cells. The high&#8208;affinity DNA binding macrocyclic ligand efficiently suppresses oncogene expression in cancer cells.

         <title>Evidence of Al(II) Radical Addition to Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic Al(III) species have long dominated the aluminum reactivity towards arenes. Recently, nucleophilic low&#8208;valent Al(I) aluminyl anions have showcased oxidative additions towards arenes C&#8208;C and/or C&#8208;H bonds. Herein, we communicate compelling evidence of an Al(II) radical addition reaction to the benzene ring. The electron reduction of a ligand stabilized precursor with KC8 in benzene furnishes a double addition to the benzene ring instead of a C&#8208;H bond activation, producing the corresponding cyclohexa&#8208;1,3(orl,4)&#8208;dienes as Birch&#8208;type reduction product. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT results suggest this unprecedented reactivity proceeds through a stable Al(II) radical intermediate, whose stability is a consequence of a rigid scaffold in combination with strong steric protection.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a rising star in the post&#8208;graphene era, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing for photocatalysis. Their extraordinary electronic, optical, and chemical properties endow them as promising materials for effectively harvesting light and catalyzing the redox reaction in photocatalysis. Here, we present a tutorial&#8208;style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new&#8208;comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co&#8208;catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Transfer and Spillover of Carbon Monoxide through Tandem Catalysis for Kinetics&#8208;boosted Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to produce multicarbon (C2+) feedstocks (e.g., C2H4). However, the high energy barriers for CO2 activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni&#8208;SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C2H4 selectivity of 62.5% and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 160 mA cm&#8208;2 at a low potential of &#8208;0.72 V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN3 active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni&#8208;SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO2ER to C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cell Using a Fluoride&#8208;Assisted Surface Gradient Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important components of perovskite/Si tandem devices. However, the efficiency of wide bandgap PSCs has been limited by their huge open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit due to non&#8208;radiative recombination. Deep&#8208;level acceptor defects are identified as the major killers of VOC, and they can be effectively improved by passivation with ammonium salts. Theoretical calculation predicts that increasing the distance between F and &#8208;NH3+ of fluorinated ammonium can dramatically enhance the electropositivity of &#8208;NH3+ terminals, thus providing strong adsorption onto the negatively charged IA and IPb anti&#8208;site defects. Characterizations further confirm that surface gradient passivation employing p&#8208;FPEAI demonstrates the most efficient passivation effect. Consequently, a record&#8208;efficiency of 21.63% with the smallest VOC deficit of 441 mV is achieved for 1.68 eV&#8208;bandgap inverted PSCs. Additionally, a flexible PSC and 1 cm2 opaque device also deliver the highest PCEs of 21.02% and 19.31%, respectively.</dc:description>

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with fast&#8208;charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Inspired by the disordered Rubik's cube, here, we report that the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of hexacyanoferrate (HCF). An example of HE&#8208;HCF has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability over 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and an outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability up to 75&#8197;C. Remarkable air stability and all&#8208;climate performance are observed. Its quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations. This strategy provides new insights into the development of advanced electrodes and provides the opportunity to tune electrochemical performance by tailoring the atomic composition.

         <title>Amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheets@Crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorods for High Current&#8208;density Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step strategy. The catalysts display efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, as well as for water splitting in neutral solution. The amorphous structure abundant unsaturated sites altered the local electronic structure of metallic sites and optimized the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*).







Abstract
It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514&#8197;mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 delivers excellent stability for at least 300&#8197;h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.

&lt;p&gt;Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple one-step strategy. The catalysts display efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, as well as for water splitting in neutral solution. The amorphous structure abundant unsaturated sites altered the local electronic structure of metallic sites and optimized the energy barrier for the rate-determining step (O* to OOH*).

         <title>Emerging Materials for Interfacial Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on solar&#8208;driven water purification has grown rapidly over the past years and emerging materials such as polymers, MOFs and COFs have been employed in this field recently. This minireview gives an overview of the basic concepts and principles for solar evaporation systems and on the development of novel photothermal materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water purification is considered as an effective and sustainable technology for water treatment using green solar energy. One major goal for practical applications is to improve the solar evaporation performance by the design of novel photothermal materials, with optimized heat localization and water transport pathways to achieve reduced energy consumption for water vaporization. Recently, some emerging materials like polymers, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and also single molecules were employed to construct novel solar evaporation systems. In this minireview, we present an overview of the recent efforts on materials development for water purification systems. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of these emerging materials for solar&#8208;driven water treatment, including desalination, wastewater purification, sterilization and energy production, are also summarized.

         <title>A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and engineering of new plastic degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable and circular plastics economy. This field has so far yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New research from Uttamapinant&#160;et al.&#160;reports the discovery of a novel PET hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome that displays improved properties and catalytic performance over previously characterized PETases. The authors also demonstrate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, pDAP, which upon photodecaging enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface. Together, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion to produce new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Alters the NH3 vs N2H4 Product Profile in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Nitrogen Reduction via Dual Reactivity from an Iron Hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas synthetically catalyzed nitrogen reduction (N2R) to produce ammonia is widely studied, catalysis to instead produce hydrazine (N2H4) has received less attention despite its considerable mechanistic interest. Herein, we disclose that irradiation of a trisphosphine&#8208;borane (P3B) Fe catalyst, P3BFe+, significantly alters its product profile to increase N2H4 versus NH3; P3BFe is otherwise known to be highly selective for NH3. We posit a key terminal hydrazido intermediate, P3BFe=NNH2, as selectivity&#8208;determining. Whereas its singlet ground state undergoes protonation to liberate NH3, a low&#8208;lying triplet excited state leads to reactivity at N&#945; and formation of N2H4. Associated electrochemical and spectroscopic studies establish that N2H4 lies along a unique product pathway; NH3 is not produced from N2H4. Our findings are distinct from the canonical mechanism for hydrazine formation, which proceeds via a diazene (HN=NH) intermediate and showcase light as a tool to tailor selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Surface Electric Conductivity for High&#8208;Rate LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cathode materials work as the host framework for both Li+ diffusion and electron transport in Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li+ diffusion property is always the research focus, while the electron transport property is less studied. Herein, we propose a unique strategy to elevate the rate performance through promoting the surface electric conductivity. Specifically, a disordered rock&#8208;salt phase was coherently constructed at the surface of LiCoO2, promoting the surface electric conductivity by over one magnitude. It increased the effective voltage (Veff) imposed in the bulk, thus driving more Li+ extraction/insertion and making LiCoO2exhibit superior rate capability (154 mA h g&#8208;1 at 10 C), and excellent cycling performance (93% after 1000 cycles at 10 C). The universality of this strategy was confirmed by another surface design and a simulation. Our findings provide a new angle for developing high&#8208;rate cathode materials by tuning the surface electron transport property.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral dearomatization transforms biaryls into complex spirocycles commonly found in bioactive natural products. This polarity mismatched radical spirocyclization tolerates diverse functional groups and is applied in the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones. The first synthesis of denobilone A, a cytotoxic plant metabolite, showcases its utility to access underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;linkage strategy to make single crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) gives porous solids with gigantic Al24 units. Selective linkage replacement rigidifies the MOFs resulting in outstanding water&#8208;harvesting behaviour. The selective linkage dissociation of the MOF provides a new route to prepare highly symmetrical clusters.







Abstract
In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8208;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8208;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8208;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM=Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed nitrogen cycle utilizing electrochemical processes can be established between N2, NH3, and HNO3. Four essential reactions constitute an overall picture of the nitrogen transformation system, which facilitates the realization of a global carbon&#8208;free green energy network, and remedies the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle, along with the concomitant environmental crisis.







Abstract
Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable nitrogen economy. Synergistically combining multiple nitrogen reactions can realize efficient renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises. Here, we provide a unique aspect to discuss the intriguing nitrogen electrochemistry by linking three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8722;) and integrating four essential electrochemical reactions, i.e., the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). This minireview also summarizes the acquired knowledge of rational catalyst design and underlying reaction mechanisms for these interlinked nitrogen reactions. We further underscore the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.

&lt;p&gt;Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable nitrogen economy. Synergistically combining multiple nitrogen reactions can realize efficient renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises. Here, we provide a unique aspect to discuss the intriguing nitrogen electrochemistry by linking three essential nitrogen-containing compounds (i.e., N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and integrating four essential electrochemical reactions, i.e., the nitrogen reduction reaction (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OR). This minireview also summarizes the acquired knowledge of rational catalyst design and underlying reaction mechanisms for these interlinked nitrogen reactions. We further underscore the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen-based economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Transmembrane Transport of Exogenous Lithium Ions through Rationally Designed Supramolecular Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial Li+ channels composed of pore&#8208;forming small aromatic molecules show almost exclusive transport of exogenous lithium ions over major physiological cations, with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium ions have been applied in the clinic in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this work, we report artificial supramolecular lithium channels composed of pore&#8208;containing small aromatic molecules. By adjusting the lumen size and coordination numbers, we found that one of the supramolecular channels developed shows unprecedented transmembrane transport of exogenous lithium ions with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0, which is in the same level of that of natural Na+ channels. Furthermore, four coordination sites inside channels are found to be the basic requirement for ion transport function. Importantly, this artificial lithium channel displays very low transport of physiological Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions, especially in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and peptide therapies are expanding for disease treatment, and the development of non&#8208;invasive or mini&#8208;invasive delivery systems is essential to improve patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes. This review provides an overview of recent advances in materials, formulations, and technologies developed to overcome biological barriers to the oral and transdermal delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily implemented membrane&#8208;receptor&#8208;analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, combining the concepts of single&#8208;molecule localization and random sampling, is reported. Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single&#8208;molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling&#8208;based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer&#8208;based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer&#8208;receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer&#8208;based dynamics analysis of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.

         <title>A Type 1 Aldolase, NahE, Catalyzes a Stereoselective Nitro&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
The stereoselective Michael addition of pyruvate to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes catalyzed by NahE, a type 1 aldolase, is reported. &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids can be isolated after oxidative decarboxylation in high yields on a preparative scale, providing access to precursors of &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogues of demonstrated pharmacological activity.







Abstract
Michael addition reactions are highly useful in organic synthesis and are commonly accomplished using organocatalysts. However, the corresponding biocatalytic Michael additions are rare, typically lack synthetically useful substrate scope, and suffer from low stereoselectivity. Herein we report a biocatalytic nitro&#8208;Michael addition, catalyzed by NahE, that proceeds with low catalyst loading at room temperature in moderate to excellent enantioselectivity and high yields. A series of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes reacted with pyruvate in the presence of NahE to give, after oxidative decarboxylation, &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids in up to 99&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography, providing a simple preparative&#8208;scale route to chiral GABA analogues. This reaction represents the first example of an aldolase displaying promiscuous Michaelase activity and opens the use of nitroalkenes in place of aldehydes as substrates for aldolases.

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;bond&#8208;forming dimerization to afford the didepside lecanoric acid is shown to require both the starter acyltransferase and the thioesterase domains of the nonreducing polyketide synthase Preu6 of the fungus Preussia isomera. These domains also engage in an unexpected, direct protein&#8211;protein interaction that must be considered when attempting combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.







Abstract
Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides, such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram the ketide homologation chassis to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8211;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered for the combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.

         <title>Cadmium&#8208;Doped and Pincer Ligand&#8208;Modified Gold Nanocluster for Catalytic KA2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 with an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two PNP pincer ligands and two Au2Cd(SR)6 staple motifs has been developed as an efficient catalyst for the KA2 reaction. The cooperation between the three parts of the gold nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high activity.







Abstract
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 (PNP=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR=4&#8208;MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two Au2CdS6 staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co&#8208;modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA2 reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co&#8208;existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.

         <title>Designing Solid Electrolyte Interfaces towards Homogeneous Na Deposition: Theoretical Guidelines for Electrolyte Additives and Superior High&#8208;Rate Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) electrolyte additive is developed to accelerate Na ion diffusion through the solid electrolyte interphase layer and induce spherical Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode due to the derived NaBr with high ionic conductivity. As enabled by the 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising metal anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth lead to disastrous short circuit and poor cycle life. Through phase field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, we first predict that the sodium bromide (NaBr) with the lowest Na ion diffusion energy barrier among sodium halogen compounds (NaX, X=F, Cl, Br, I) is the ideal SEI composition to induce the spherical Na deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Then, 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr&#8208;rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94&#8201;% is achieved after 2000&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 10&#8197;C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.

         <title>Correlating Oxidation State and Surface Ligand Motifs with the Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface oxidation state of titanium oxynitride photocatalysts influences C2 product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction. The surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state can be regulated and controlled through the concentration of nitrogen dopant and oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The design for non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based catalysts with the function of producing C2+ products requires systematic knowledge of the intrinsic connection between the surface state as well as the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this work, photochemical in situ spectral surface characterization techniques combined with the first principle calculations (DFT) were applied to investigate the relationships between the composition of surface states, coordinated motifs, and catalytic selectivity of a titanium oxynitride catalyst. When the catalyst mediates CO2 photoreduction, C2 product selectivity is positively correlated with the surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state is regulated and controlled by coordinated motifs of N&#8722;Ti&#8208;O/V[O], which can reduce the potential dimerization energy barriers of *CO&#8722;CO* and promote spontaneous formation of the subsequent *CO&#8722;CH2* intermediate. This phenomenon provides a new perspective for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for photoreduction of CO2 into useful products.

         <title>Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport Across Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductance of molecular junctions bridged in Pt&#8208; or Pd&#8208;adlayer modified Au electrodes was investigated. The conductance on bimetallic electrodes was found 2&#8211;30 fold higher than that on Au electrodes. This was attributed to the increase in the local density of states by partially&#8208;filled d shells of the adlayer.







Abstract
Fermi's golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial electron&#8208;transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of states (SDOS). Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single&#8208;molecule junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions. At the Fermi level, however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d&#8208;shell. To increase the electron&#8208;transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d&#8208;shells and exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy. An increase by 2&#8211;30 fold is found for single&#8208;molecule conductance of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hexanes bridged via common headgroups. The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self&#8208;energy which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS participated by d&#8208;electrons at the electrode&#8208;molecule interfaces.

         <title>Pore Geometry and Surface Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Anhydrous Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three robust and porous covalent organic frameworks with rare concave dodecagonal nanopores were designed and synthesized via a pore engineering approach. The fine&#8208;tailored and functionalized pored can anchor H3PO4 molecules to form abundant proton hopping sites, thus affording high proton conductivity at anhydrous conditions.







Abstract
Developing new materials for anhydrous proton conduction under high&#8208;temperature conditions is significant and challenging. Herein, we create a series of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a pore engineering approach. We simultaneously engineer the pore geometry (generating concave dodecagonal nanopores) and pore surface (installing multiple functional groups such as &#8722;C=N&#8722;, &#8722;OH, &#8722;N=N&#8722; and &#8722;CF3) to improve the utilization efficiency and host&#8211;guest interaction of proton carriers, hence benefiting the enhancement of anhydrous proton conduction. Upon loading with H3PO4, COFs can realize a proton conductivity of 2.33&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under anhydrous conditions, among the highest values of all COF materials. These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membranes.

These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high-temperature proton exchange membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evidence of Sulfur Non&#8208;Innocence in [CoII(dithiacyclam)]2+&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison of the abilities of two CoII complexes bearing N4 and S2N2 ligations to mediate 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the reactive intermediates point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
In many metalloenzymes, sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8208;ligation in cobalt mediated oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (1; cyclam=1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) and the S&#8208;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (2; S2N2&#8208;cyclam=1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the CoII centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.

&lt;p&gt;In many metalloenzymes, sulfur-containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S-ligation in cobalt mediated oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four-nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; cyclam=1,5,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane) and the S-containing analog [Co(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cyclam)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;; S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cyclam=1,8-dithia-5,11-diaza-cyclotetradecane) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; point to the involvement of sulfur in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
