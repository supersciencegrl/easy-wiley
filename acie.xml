         <title>Inside Back Cover: Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach to H2 extraction from liquid organic hydrocarbon carriers (LOHCs) using ultralow loading of Pt nanoparticles on a modified alumina structure with an ALD&#8208;titanium oxide shell is shown by Yongmin Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202417598). This unique catalyst design efficiently releases hydrogen from LOHCs, outperforming equivalent Pt and commercial catalysts. The ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell enhances the catalytic activity while minimizing Pt usage.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Multiple Structural and Phase Transformations of MOF and Selective Hydrocarbon Gas Separation in its Amorphous, Glass Phase States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first wide&#8208;view image of multiple structural and phase transformations in MOFs is presented by Ming&#8208;Hua Zeng and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202411150). The MOFs exhibit dynamic chemistry covering crystal&#8208;crystal and crystal&#8208;amorphous&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal evolution. The disordered hierarchical pores in amorphous and glassy MOFs enable efficient separation of C2H2/C2H4 and C3H6/C3H8 gases mixtures.

         <title>Back Cover: Single&#8208;crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;stoichiometric cocrystals of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework were constructed from two tetracarboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores. The single crystals showed versatile fluorescence, including not only homogeneous color such as purple, blue, green and white, but also heterogeneous bicolor such as blue&#8208;green and green&#8208;yellow depending on the component ratios and distributions. In their Research Article (e202419992), Ichiro Hisaki, Abderrazzak Douhal and co&#8208;workers revealed the relationship between crystal structures and fluorescent properties of single crystals.

In their Research Article (e202416088), Holger Helten and co&#8208;authors present a strictly alternating BN&#8208;isostere of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) and well&#8208;defined oligomers. The polymerization was achieved by an AB&#8208;type step&#8208;growth polycondensation of a monomer (illustrated on the top right) featuring one N and one B terminus. The compounds show pronounced fluorescence with hypsochromic shifts with increasing chain length and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties to water (AIEE), solvent polarity and viscosity, temperature, as well as mechanical impact (Cover design: Leonie W&#252;st).

         <title>Access to Quaternary&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutylsilanes by Ring Opening of Arylbicyclobutanes with Silyllithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the silyllithium&#8208;mediated generation and in&#8208;situ cleavage of quaternary&#8208;substituted bicyclobutanes to diastereoselectively afford cyclobutylsilanes. Formally, this reaction is a nucleophilic substitution at a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom with a carbon leaving group. The utility of the generated products was demonstrated by a Tamao&#8722;Fleming oxidation to prepare a substituted cyclobutanol.







Abstract
Disclosed herein is the reaction of silyllithium reagents with quaternary&#8208;substituted arylbicyclobutanes to diastereoselectively form polysubstituted cyclobutylsilanes by C&#8722;C bond cleavage. The bicyclobutanes are generated in&#8197;situ, by lithium&#8208;halogen exchange, from readily accessible (bromomethyl)iodocyclopropane precursors, rendering this a one&#8208;pot transformation. The trapping of a generated cyclobutyllithium intermediate with an electrophile was also demonstrated, providing a cyclobutane product with vicinal quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the cyclobutylsilane products was showcased by Tamao&#8722;Fleming oxidation to prepare a quaternary&#8208;substituted cyclobutanol.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for methylfuran aromatization (CCMA) was investigated by Anqing Zheng and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202420779). Compared to the individual conversion of methylfuran, CCMA boosts arene formation, enhances catalyst stability, and enables efficient CO2 reduction simultaneously. Employing SVUV&#8208;PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS, operando spectroscopic techniques, and isotopic labeling elucidates key reaction pathways, paving the way for the innovative and efficient valorization of biomass in a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

         <title>Controlled Introduction of sp3 Quantum Defects in Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the photophysics of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) holds immense potential for their applications in sensing and imaging. By using mechanochemistry, sp3 quantum defects are introduced in fluorescent SWCNTs via a solid&#8208;state reaction within 5&#8197;min. This method allows by varying the mechanochemical energy impact to create quantum defects at extremely low defect densities and chemical control without diminishing fluorescence.







Abstract
Precise control over low&#8208;dimensional materials holds an immense potential for their applications in sensing, imaging and information processing. The controlled introduction of sp3 quantum defects (color centers) can be used to tailor the optoelectronic properties of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the tissue transparency (&gt;800&#8197;nm) and the telecommunication window. However, an uncontrolled functionalization of SWCNTs with defects leads to a loss of the NIR fluorescence. Here, we use mechanochemistry with aryldiazonium salts to create quantum defects in SWCNTs. The reaction proceeds within 5&#8197;min without solvents or illumination and can be controlled by a varied mechanochemical energy impact. By working in the solid&#8208;state, this method presents an alternative synthetic route and marks a crucial step for tailoring photophysics of SWCNTs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanics&#8211;photophysics correlation in tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived roomtemperature phosphorescence ionogels is deciphered by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In their Research Article (e202419114), Y. Tang et al. utilize DMA to explore the relationship between the mechanical and photophysical properties and explain it using two special temperatures (Tloss and Tg). Such a method shows the merits of immediate indication of performance toward ionogels, like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking visual senses with the tactile senses.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Carbon Perovskite Solar Cells via Cathode Interface Engineering by using CuPc Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces Cu(II) phthalocyanine as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material induces a structural transformation from monoclinic to a tetragonal phase, facilitating the passivation of the Perovskite surface in conjunction with carbon electrodes. These findings mark a substantial advancement in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, successfully combining high power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
Carbon perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) represent a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology that addresses the long&#8208;term operating stability needed to compete with commercial Si solar cells. However, the poor interface contacts between the carbon electrode and the perovskite result in a gap between C&#8208;PSC&#8242;s performances and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs based on metallic back electrodes. In this work, Cu (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was rediscovered as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) to be coupled with carbon electrodes. In particular, based on computational studies and VASP calculations, it is found that the tetragonal structure of CuPc could efficiently coordinated to perovskite (P) layer via N and Cu atoms to Pb and I atoms, respectively. By systematically optimizing the concentration of the CuPc HTL solution, and screening the coupling of CuPc HTL with two types of carbon electrodes, based on carbon black:graphite (C&#8208;G) mixture and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), respectively, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.4&#8201;% (the mean PCE value of 18.57 %) has been achieved. In addition, our cells exhibit satisfactory stability under thermal aging at 85&#176;C, showing less than 20% PCE loss after more than 200 hours. Furthermore, they maintain excellent shelf&#8208;life stability, with only 1.3% PCE loss over 20 days under ambient conditions (ISOS&#8208;D1). These findings represent a significant step forward in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, as they combine both high PCE and stability.

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic designer aqueous micelles hold significant promise as versatile media, functioning as solvents, electrolytes, and reaction boosters in electrocatalysis. Their unique structures and properties enhance the efficiency of transition metal&#8208;free hydrodefluorination of geminal difluorinated indoles, thereby eliminating the need for toxic organic solvents and supporting electrolytes. This process sustainably and selectively removes a fluorine atom, producing valuable monofluorinated indoles, as reported by Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202416132).

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment and Oxygen Electroreduction Reaction Performance Correlationship of Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (PFePc) offer well&#8208;defined sites, rendering them ideal model systems to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but have struggled to achieve improved catalytic activity due to uniform electron distribution of iron center and difficulty in molecular&#8208;level structure design. Although rationally linkage microenvironmental regulation is an effective approach to adjusting activity, the underlying fundamental mechanism is incompletely understood. Herein, systematic DFT calculations and experimental investigation of PFePc analogous reveal that the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing benzophenone linkage into the PFePc backbone (PFePc&#8208;3) drives the delocalization of Fe d&#8208;orbital electrons, downshifts the d&#8208;band energy level, thereby tailoring the key OH* intermediate interaction, demonstrating enhanced ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V, a high mass activity of 21.43 A g&#8208;1, and a high turnover frequency of 2.18 e s&#8722;1 site&#8722;1. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that linkage regulation can induce a 3d electron with high spin&#8208;state (t2g3eg2) of PFePc&#8208;3, significantly accelerating the ORR kinetics. In&#8208;situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry further highlight the rapid kinetics of PFePc&#8208;3 to the high accessible site density (6.14&#215;1019 site g&#8208;1) and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.</dc:description>

Magnetic susceptibility measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that linkage regulation can induce a 3d electron with high spin-state (t2g3eg2) of PFePc-3, significantly accelerating the ORR kinetics. In-situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and variable-frequency square wave voltammetry further highlight the rapid kinetics of PFePc-3 to the high accessible site density (6.14&#215;1019 site g-1) and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zeolite Blending: A New Approach to Direct Crystallization of Aluminosilicate Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various synthesis methods for zeolites have been developed to date; however, precise control over aluminum (Al) content remains a significant challenge. For instance, in the case of CON&#8208;type zeolites, it is especially difficult to obtain a Si/Al ratio below a value of approximately 100 by direct synthesis, and below approximately 30 by post&#8208;treatment. In this study, we have developed a novel direct synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite having desired Al content by applying the interzeolite conversion/interzeolite transformation, wherein precursor zeolites that possess common composite building units (CBUs) with the target zeolite are employed as the Al and Si source. Initially, a single zeolite was utilized as a precursor, resulting in the successful synthesis of a high Al CON&#8208;type zeolite (Si/Al=40). Finally, we developed a novel synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite; blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as starting material in the IZC method led to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al = 20).</dc:description>

         <title>Degradable Adhesives as Sustainable Alternatives to Acrylics via Ring&#8208;Opening Radical Polymerization of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are loosely crosslinked polymer networks widely used across various industries. However, the network structure and inert nature of the acrylic polymer backbone present sustainability challenges. To address these issues, efforts are being made to incorporate degradable units into the polymer backbone. Yet, two key obstacles remain: i) the polymer does not degrade into sufficiently small fragments, and ii) the adhesive and viscoelastic properties are often inferior to those of conventional acrylic polymers. In this study, we developed a PSA utilizing vinylcyclopropane (VCP)&#8208;based monomers and a VCP&#8208;based crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesive performance and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs. Under optimized polymerization conditions, the polymer incorporates ozone&#8208;labile double bonds into its backbone, enabling controlled molecular degradation without compromising its properties. By synthesizing and strategically combining various VCP&#8208;based monomers, we developed PSAs with tailored adhesion and viscoelastic behavior on par with conventional acrylic PSAs. These advancements indicate that the degradable polymers and PSAs developed in this study are poised for practical application in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Mass Discovery and High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Fluoroether&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Stability Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing novel fluoroether electrolytes with high&#8208;voltage stability is an effective strategy to improve the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, the vast chemical space of fluoroether is underexplored due to the absence of effective tools to evaluate the potential used in high&#8208;voltage LMB. Herein, a framework was developed in combination of Voting ensemble algorithms and graph convolution neural network (GCNN), allowing the fast assessment of oxidative stability of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, synthesizability of solvents as well as the solvation ability of them to dissolve lithium salts. Potential fluoroether solvent candidates for high&#8208;voltage LMB were screened out from a virtual library comprising 5576 electrolytes constructed by a combination of 1510 solvents and 4 salts. Among them, two fluorinated ethers, 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) propane and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3,12&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5,10,13&#8208;tetraoxatetradecane, were successfully synthesized and showed satisfactory high&#8208;voltage stability, sufficient solvation ability and satisfactory cycling with almost 99.5% coulombic efficiency in Li||NMC811 full cell. This work provided an efficient framework for the discovery of solvents with high&#8208;voltage tolerance in a vast structural space prior to experimental synthesis, accelerating the development of advanced electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Sabatier Principle Inspired Bifunctional Alloy Interface for Stable and High&#8208;Depth Discharging Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. The &#8216;just right&#8217; interaction between TM and Zn endows Cu@Zn electrodes with remarkable reversibility and uniform pre&#8208;stripping morphologies in aqueous Zn metal batteries cycling under high depth of discharging.







Abstract
Achieving stable Zn anodes that can effectively couple with Zn&#8208;free cathodes is essential for advancing high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries. Here, we propose a Sabatier principle inspired bifunctional transition&#8208;metal (TM) interface to enable homogeneous Zn dissolution during discharging and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition during charging. Among various TM&#8208;coated Zn (TM@Zn) electrodes, Cu@Zn exhibits the highest reversibility and structural stability, attributed to the optimal interaction between Cu and Zn. The heteroatomic interaction&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance parallels the Sabatier principle. Morphological analyses reveal that bare Zn anodes display detrimental etching pits during stripping, which is different from the uniform dissolution for Cu@Zn electrodes. During subsequent plating, the conductive interface serves as a secondary current collector for uniform Zn deposition in Cu@Zn, thus demonstrating a bifunctional nature. Atomic observations disclose the working mechanisms of this interface as a gradual phase transition from Cu to CuZn5 during cycling. The Cu@Zn anodes exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;h at a low current of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 250&#8197;h at a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. They also demonstrate practical feasibility by maintaining 88.7&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles in Cu@Zn||VO2 full cells. This work provides new insights into the Sabatier chemistry inspired bifunctional layers for Zn metal battery system.

         <title>Flow Electroreductive Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation of Alkenes Using gem&#8208;Dichloroalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient continuous&#8208;flow electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins using commercial gem&#8208;dichloroalkanes. The reaction is tolerant to oxygen and moisture while displaying a broad functional group compatibility. This methodology enables gram&#8208;scale cyclopropanation and is compatible with a wide range of alkenes. Mechanistic studies suggests that a nickel carbene is electro&#8208;generated to afford the cyclopropane ring.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;We report an efficient continuous-flow electroreductive nickel-catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins using commercial &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dichloroalkanes. The reaction is tolerant to oxygen and moisture while displaying a broad functional group compatibility. This methodology enables gram-scale cyclopropanation and is compatible with a wide range of alkenes. Mechanistic studies suggests that a nickel carbene is electro-generated to afford the cyclopropane ring.

         <title>Kauzmann Paradox, Supercooling, and Finding Order in Chaos</title>

         <dc:description>
80&#8201;years later: Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox remains an enigma for nearly 80&#8197;years without any unifying resolution. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox, however, have so far been limited in the existence of an equilibrium ideal glass transition and traditional description of phase transition. Continued evolution of our understanding in thermodynamics, however, has revealed more knowledge on the subject matter, leading us closer to the resolution of this paradox. This review undergoes a historical perspective of the journey from Kauzmann's day until now.







Abstract
Prediction of a liquidus state with lower entropy than the corresponding solid at Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox, remains an enigma. Despite efforts to resolve this paradox for nearly 80&#8197;years, no unifying resolution has been reported. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox rely on an ideal glass transition, however, this limits the interpretation of Tk as an equilibrium critical point rather than an instability. Focusing on entropy, statistical mechanics and non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics becomes a key tenet in resolving this paradox. Expansion in phase space beyond 2D and consideration of Tk as a non&#8208;equilibrium critical point is necessary to understand the extent of liquid relaxation beyond Tk. In this review, we provide an entropic perspective of the relaxation behavior of supercooled liquids, associated expanded phase diagram, and the potential resolution to the Kauzmann paradox. This work integrates the historical evolution of our understanding of entropy/thermodynamics with modern interpretation of quantum states through renormalization group and thermodynamic speed limits.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deconstruction of Polyolefins: A Strategy to Up&#8208;cycle Waste Polyethylene to Value&#8208;Added Alkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed method for deconstructing polyethylene into value&#8208;added long&#8208;chain alkenes. The process involves dehydrogenation, introducing 3.38&#8201;% double bonds, followed by cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. This results in 58&#8201;% selective production of dodecene (C12) derivatives, with a 1:0.8 ratio of terminal to internal olefins. The method is effective for post&#8208;consumer polyethylene waste.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from post&#8208;consumer waste polyolefins is fascinating as well as challenging. Here we report ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed up&#8208;cycling of the polyethylene to long&#8208;chain alkene derivatives. The developed methodology mainly involves two steps i.e., dehydrogenation of polyethylene through hydrogen atom transfer and its metathesis using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene using ruthenium catalysis derived up to 3.38&#8201;%, of double bonds; with 90&#8201;% of the recovered polyolefin material. The obtained unsaturated polyethylene was subjected to cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using HG&#8208;II catalytic system. This resulted in the synthesis of predominantly dodecene (C12) derivatives, with 58&#8201;% selectivity, along with other derivatives of varying chain lengths. The overall reaction produced terminal and internal olefins in the ratio 1:0.8 respectively. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene and its deconstruction was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The origin of C12 selectivity has been demonstrated by control experiments. The scope of the methodology was extended to post&#8208;consumer waste polyethylene which gave high conversion to value&#8208;added dodecene derivatives as a major product.

         <title>Intrinsically Photothermal&#8208;Driven and Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Enabled by Multifunctional Dynamic Covalent Organic Photothermal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional photothermal molecule is introduced for the fabrication of novel versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomers. The obtained materials possessed both photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and reconfigurability. Three demonstration models, a biomimetic flower, a soft gripper, and a weightlifting actuator have been created to demonstrate the reconfigurability of actuators.







Abstract
Intrinsically photothermal&#8208;responsive soft actuators possessing reconfigurability have attracted great attention due to their ability to change their actuation mode to satisfy diverse practical applications. However, challenges remain in designing and fabricating organic photothermal molecules featuring polymerizable or cross&#8208;linkable groups, especially those with multifunctional properties. Here, a novel class of versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, denoted as PUOLCE, has been developed. The multifunctional dynamic covalent organic photothermal molecules, serving as chain extenders, photothermal agents, and dynamic covalent bond precursors, are chemically bonded into LCEs, thereby endowing the LCEs with photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic properties. The intrinsic photothermal effect of PUOLCE allows the exchange reaction of dynamic oxime&#8208;carbamate bonds to undergo rapid welding under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Leveraging the NIR&#8208;assisted welding strategy, the PUOLCE&#8208;based building units are capable of assembling into various complex actuators with new deformation modes. Besides, the assembled actuators can be easily reconfigured to perform different mechanical tasks (e.g., flower blooming, grasping objects, and elevating objects) under NIR illumination. Furthermore, the PUOLCE actuators can be controlled globally or locally for light&#8208;driven locomotion by controlling the area exposed to the NIR irradiation. This work provides insights into the development of adaptive soft actuators with tunable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities.

         <title>Synergizing Mg Single Atoms and Ru Nanoclusters for Boosting the Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube, was constructed to boost the catalytic performance of Ru catalysts. Mg atoms beneath Ru built an enhanced interfacial electronic metal&#8208;support interaction. Mg SACs adjacent to Ru aided H2O adsorption and activation. The synergistic Mg SACs and Ru nanoclusters promises an excellent catalytic performance for ammonia borane hydrolysis to produce H2.







Abstract
Development of efficient catalysts with high H2O molecule activation ability holds great importance for H2 production. Herein, enzyme&#8208;mimic Mg single atoms catalysts (SACs) coordinated by B/N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (BNC), was constructed as a high&#8208;performance support for ruthenium (Ru) nano&#8208;clusters. Dual functions of Mg SACs were discovered, where the Mg atoms beneath Ru catalysts built an interfacial electron polarization, inducing electron transfer from Ru to the Mg&#8208;BNC support. In addition, the oxyphilic Mg SACs adjacent to the Ru catalysts could actively participate in H2O adsorption. The combination of experimental characterization, reaction kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated a stronger intrinsic H2O activation capability at the positive Ru sites. Meanwhile, the synergistic Mg SACs jointly contribute to the acceleration of the sluggish H2O dissociation process in ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis reaction, resulting in exceptional hydrogen production activity and catalytic stability, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for utilizing alkaline earth metals as both the electronic promoter and the reactant activator, offering inspiration for the development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Perylene Diimide Macrocycle Chiroptical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle has been prepared in which point chiral imide groups yield a discrete helical dimer, to mimic a helical supramolecular assembly. The macrocycle exhibits three&#8208;way switching of its chiroptical properties in solution (+/&#8722;/off). This behaviour can be controlled by various stimuli, including the binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and identifies important structure&#8208;property relationships for chiral materials.







Abstract
Helical assemblies of organic dyes are ubiquitous chiral organic materials, with valuable properties including chiroptical switching due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report a novel chiral bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle, which acts as a discrete molecular model for a chiral supramolecular assembly. Point chirality is installed through amino acid&#8208;derived imide groups which, upon macrocyclization, is translated into helical chirality in the perylene diimide dimer. In solution, the macrocycle's chiroptical properties are switchable, with both the sign (+/&#8722;) and amplitude (on/off) of the signal tuned using solvent and molecular recognition stimuli respectively. The chiral structure&#8211;property relationships identified from this macrocycle are important for the design of high fidelity supramolecular chiroptical switches.

         <title>Unlocking Hexafluoroisopropanol as a Practical Anion&#8208;Binding Catalyst for Living Cationic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution unlocks a simple, versatile, robust, and sustainable anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy for living cationic polymerization, wherein commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to mediate dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, thereby delivering unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions.







Abstract
Living cationic polymerization (LCP) is a classical technique for precision polymer synthesis; however, due to the high sensitivity of cationic active species towards chain&#8208;transfer/termination events, it is notoriously difficult to control polymerization under mild conditions, which inhibits its progress in advanced materials engineering. Here, we unlock a practical anion&#8208;binding catalytic strategy to address the historical dilemma in LCP. Our experimental and mechanistic studies demonstrate that commercially accessible hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), when used in high loading, can create higher&#8208;order HFIP aggregates to tame dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium via non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding principle, in turn inducing distinctive polymerization kinetics behaviors that grant efficient chain propagation while minimizing competitive side reactions. This unique control mechanism delivers unprecedented polymerization activity and controllability across various electron&#8208;rich vinyl monomers under mild conditions, and provides easy access to high molecular weight polymers, block copolymers, and end&#8208;functionalized telechelic polymers. Also, the minimalistic structure of HFIP coupled with its convenient removal and recycle renders this approach easy to scale up, without concern for cost, sustainability and complicated work&#8208;up processes associated with previous systems. This study presents another universal and sustainable strategy for cationic macromolecular engineering, and will also stimulate further exploration of innovative non&#8208;covalent catalysis that enables more challenging living polymerization systems.

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Fused Cyanoindone: A Superior Building Block for Designing Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Electron Acceptor with Long&#8208;Range Ordered Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzothiadiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability was designed to synthesize an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap acceptor BTC&#8208;2. Benefiting from long&#8208;range ordered stacking induced by BTC, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTC&#8208;2 based organic photovoltaic device delivered a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency with a photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and achieved a light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi&#8208;transparent application.







Abstract
There are great demands of developing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors for multifunctional electronic devices, particularly semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for building&#8208;integrated applications. However, current ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap materials applied in OPVs, primarily based on electron&#8208;rich cores, exhibit defects of high&#8208;lying energy levels and inferior performance. We herein proposed a novel strategy by designing the benzothiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability as the terminal to synthesize the acceptor BTC&#8208;2. The BTC unit imparts red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1000&#8197;nm to BTC&#8208;2, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and the quinoid resonance effect. Additionally, BTC&#8208;2 features deep&#8208;lying energy levels with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of &#8722;5.81&#8197;eV, due to the ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of BTC. Furthermore, BTC&#8208;2 exhibits long&#8208;range ordering in both molecular packing and macroscopic blend morphology, resulting from shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder packing of two BTC units, leading to an ultra&#8208;long exciton lifetime over 1.1&#8197;ns. These superiorities facilitated a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency in the binary OPV device with an extremely high photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, representing the best performance for ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors, and a record light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi&#8208;transparent systems. Overall, BTC is a superior building block for designing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Silacyclobutanes with Alkenes: Mimicking the Reactivity and Reversing the Selectivity Towards Late Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of Ti&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs with alkenes. Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our system also shows complementary selectivity to give distinct products. Structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring opening and expansion reactions of silacyclobutanes (SCBs) constitute an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical strategy to construct value&#8208;added silicon&#8208;containing chemicals. Despite extensive studies, the reaction of SCBs with simple alkenes has only one precedent. Moreover, most reported reactions of SCBs use late transition metals (Pd, Ni, Rh) as catalysts. By contrast, there are no reports of using early transition metals. Herein, we report the first example, to our knowledge, of early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs using earth's second abundant titanium as a catalyst. Notably, orthogonal selectivity was observed. Selective activation of the relatively inert C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our titanium system also shows complementary selectivity towards late transition metals to give distinct products. Thus, structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford structurally diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain using other transition metals.

         <title>Synergizing Interfacial Electric Field Regulation and In situ Robust Interphases for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries at High Currents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unstable cycling of lithium metal anode at high currents has hindered the viability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report a novel fluorocarbon additive, containing iodine, nitrogen, and fluorine elements, to regulate the interfacial electric field and promote the formation of mechanically robust and ionically conductive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, leading to remarkable electrochemical performances at high current conditions.







Abstract
Efficient cycling of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) under extremely high current conditions is critical for their practical applications. Here, we report a novel additive containing fluorine, nitrogen, and iodine elements (designated as FCS) to stabilize Li metal anodes in glyme&#8208;based ether electrolytes under high current conditions. Experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the cation of FCS selectively adsorbs on the electrode surface, optimizing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) structure and effectively regulating the surface electric field, thereby promoting homogeneous Li deposition. Simultaneously, the preferential decomposition of the FCS produces a mechanically robust and ionically conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, Li3N, and LiI components. Consequently, with the FCS additive, Li||Cu cells demonstrate a remarkably average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.12&#8201;% at an extremely high current of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 400 cycles. Additionally, Li||SPAN cells maintain a reversible capacity of 1126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. This work presents a new approach to simultaneously tune the Helmholtz plane and SEI using trace amounts of additive, paving the way for stable and efficient LMBs under high&#8208;current conditions.

     alt="Synergizing Interfacial Electric Field Regulation and In situ Robust Interphases for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries at High Currents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unstable cycling of lithium metal anode at high currents has hindered the viability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report a novel fluorocarbon additive, containing iodine, nitrogen, and fluorine elements, to regulate the interfacial electric field and promote the formation of mechanically robust and ionically conductive electrode-electrolyte interphases, leading to remarkable electrochemical performances at high current conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient cycling of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) under extremely high current conditions is critical for their practical applications. Here, we report a novel additive containing fluorine, nitrogen, and iodine elements (designated as FCS) to stabilize Li metal anodes in glyme-based ether electrolytes under high current conditions. Experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the cation of FCS selectively adsorbs on the electrode surface, optimizing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) structure and effectively regulating the surface electric field, thereby promoting homogeneous Li deposition. Simultaneously, the preferential decomposition of the FCS produces a mechanically robust and ionically conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) comprising LiF, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, and LiI components. Consequently, with the FCS additive, Li||Cu cells demonstrate a remarkably average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.12&#8201;% at an extremely high current of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 400 cycles. Additionally, Li||SPAN cells maintain a reversible capacity of 1126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200 cycles. This work presents a new approach to simultaneously tune the Helmholtz plane and SEI using trace amounts of additive, paving the way for stable and efficient LMBs under high-current conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steady State Free Precession NMR without Fourier Transform: Redefining the Capabilities of 19F NMR as a Discovery Tool</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steady state free precession (SSFP) &#8211; Complete Reduction to Amplitude Frequency Tables (CRAFT) not only improves sensitivity, resolution and number of signals detected by NMR but can also dramatically reduce experiment times. This powerful approach unlocks the potential of NMR as a discovery tool, enabling unprecedented detection of fluorinated compounds in environmental and biological samples.







Abstract
The 2024 Zurich perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) summit reiterated the urgent need for non&#8208;selective analytical approaches for PFC detection. 19F NMR holds great potential, however, sensitivity limitations lead to long analysis times and/or the possibility of not detecting low concentration species. Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) NMR collects the signal in a steady state regime, allowing 100&#8217;s of acquisitions in the timespan of a single traditional NMR scan. Unfortunately, data truncation from SSFP leads to artifacts and spectral broadening with Fourier transform, hindering interpretation. When non&#8208;Fourier based time&#8208;domain analysis is used, namely, complete reduction to amplitude frequency tables (CRAFT), limitations of SSFP are eliminated while sensitivity gains are retained. This work introduces the combined approach, then applies it for the measurement of PFCs in environmental and biological samples. In all cases, the approach reduces analysis time from many hours to minutes and/or greatly increases the range of compounds detected. For example, when PFOA was spiked into human blood, the detection limit improved ~50&#8208;fold vs standard NMR, while in a standard mixture, the approach detected compounds missed by LC&#8208;MS/MS. The technique can be adapted to any nucleus providing a facile approach to reduce experiment time and improve sensitivity of NMR in general.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cluster&#8208;Cluster Heterostructure Enabling Fast Hydrogen Evolution for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. A strongly coupled Pt&#8722;NiOx cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure simultaneously modulates the coordination environment of Pt and Ni, and delivers fast alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The corresponding AEMWE device with an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading of 50&#8197;&#956;gPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibits by far the best electrochemical performance (1.90&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The results highlight the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon black has been extensively employed as the support for noble metal catalysts for electrocatalysis applications. However, the nearly catalytic inertness and weak interaction with metal species of carbon black are two major obstacles that hinder the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Herein, we report a surface functionalization strategy by decorating transition metal oxide clusters on the commercial carbon black to offer specific catalytic activity and enhanced interaction with metal species. In the case of NiOx cluster&#8208;decorated carbon black, a strongly coupled cluster&#8208;cluster heterostructure consisting of Pt clusters and NiOx clusters (Pt&#8722;NiOx/C) is formed and delivers greatly enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution kinetics. The NiOx clusters can not only accelerate the hydrogen evolution process as the co&#8208;catalyst, but also optimize the adsorption of H intermediates on Pt and stabilize the Pt clusters. Notably, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Pt&#8722;NiOx/C as the cathode catalyst (with a loading of only 50&#8197;&#956;gPt cm&#8722;2) delivers the most competitive electrochemical performance reported to date, requiring only 1.90&#8197;V to reach a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The results demonstrate the significance of surface functionalization of carbonaceous supports toward the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Helical Tubular Dyad of [9]Cycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties and Post&#8208;Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the site&#8208;specific functionalization strategy, a radially conjugated, helical tubular molecule has been constructed by covalently connecting [9]cycloparaphenylenes with three sp&#8208;hybridized all&#8208;carbon linkers. This compound exhibits intriguing solid&#8208;state packing patterns, exceptional CPL characteristics, and facile post&#8208;functionalization.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of discrete tubular molecules that mimic the structural features of carbon nanotubes has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit for synthetic chemists. As the shortest segments of armchair&#8208;type carbon nanotubes, cycloparaphenylenes are regarded as ideal macrocyclic building blocks for achieving this goal. Here we report the synthesis of a helical tubular molecule featuring three diyne linkers between two site&#8208;specifically functionalized [9]cycloparaphenylenes. Its C3&#8208;symmetrical, radially conjugated structure and solid&#8208;state packing have been elucidated by spectroscopic and crystallographic characterizations. Notably, the resolved enantiomers display a circularly polarized luminescence brightness value of 1.47&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is among the highest values for chiral organic molecules. Furthermore, the diyne&#8208;linked molecule could be directly converted into a thiophene&#8208;linked helical molecule, demonstrating the post&#8208;functionalization approach for the construction of chiral tubular molecules from cycloparaphenylenes.

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are three ring fusion patterns from one chemical reaction. Carbocyclic heptannulation provides access to brightly fluorescent, chiral perylene diimides, which can be converted into highly electrophilic tropylium cations and functionalized by direct aromatic substitution reactions.







Abstract
The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linking of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to &#960;&#8208;Extended Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst for H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity were constructed using dimethyldiazapyrene as a newly developed monomer upon Knoevenagel condensation. Their &#960;&#8208;extended structures from vinylene linking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons building blocks, rendered them with promising semiconducting properties, allowing for conducting exceptional visible&#8208;light photocatalytic generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp2&#8208;carbon bridges to form high&#8208;crystalline &#960;&#8208;extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two&#8208;dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,9&#8208;diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene&#8208;linked PAH&#8208;cored COFs, which show high&#8208;crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as&#8208;prepared COFs possess spatially extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible&#8208;light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H2O2 up to 3820&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water, and even 17080&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing a Multifunctional Surface Modulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

For the first time, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to address the iodide and Pb&#8208;related defects, and Li+ ions migration suppression simultaneously. Consequently, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Simultaneously passivating the perovskite surface defects and suppressing Li+ ions diffusion of hole transport layer (HTL) are still challenging issues. Herein, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to simultaneously address the above issues. It is found that ZR3 is not only capable of passivating the Pb&#8208;related defects at the surface of perovskite by the SO3&#8722; group, but also possesses the remarkable ability to passivate the halide defects with Na+ ions. Meanwhile, ZR3 treatment enables the enhanced exciton dissociation of perovskite, better energy level alignment with hole transport layer (HTL), improved hole extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, and reduced charge carrier recombination in device. Therefore, it results in the enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34&#8201;% in ZR3&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p device from 22.97&#8201;% for the control device. Specifically, p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ZR3 also achieves an improved PCE of 25.96&#8201;% with respect to the pristine one (23.99&#8201;%), proving the universality of ZR3 for PSCs. Moreover, the stabilities of ZR3&#8208;treated devices are significantly enhanced owing to Li+ ions migration suppressing and perovskite defects reduction.

         <title>A photosynthesis&#8208;derived bionic system for sustainable biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process, a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module was proposed for supply of NADPH and ATP in cell factory. The proposed new strategy enables facilitating both CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing and opens the possibility of manufacturing industry revolution driven by sustainable solar energy.







Abstract
&#8220;Cell factory&#8221; strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide /nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H and adenosine triphosphate ATP. However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NAD(P)H and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic disorder. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NAD(P)H and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light&#8208;driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NAD(P)H and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light&#8208;driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission mitigation and high&#8208;value chemical biomanufacturing.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;Like Multiblock Polymers by Modulating the Branch Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform for recyclable multiblock polymers has been explored, facilitating the production of various polyethylene&#8208;like multiblock polymers with adjustable side chain mobility. This approach allows for tuning of thermal and mechanical properties while preserving high melting temperatures and consistent morphology. Additionally, this method advances the research of recyclable adhesive materials and selective recycling processes.







Abstract
Developing plastics that fill the need of polyolefins yet are more easily recyclable is a critical need to address the plastic waste crisis. However, most efforts in this vein have focused on high&#8208;density polyethylene (PE), while many different types of PE exist. To create broadly sustainable PE with modular properties, we present the synthesis, characterization, and demonstration of materials applications for chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock polymers prepared from distinct hard and soft blocks using ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative polymerization. By altering the branching pattern within the soft blocks, a series of PE&#8208;like multiblock polymers were synthesized with tunable glass transition temperatures (Tg) while maintaining consistent high melting temperatures (Tm). A clear U&#8208;shape trend between Tg and mechanical properties was found, showcasing their potential as sustainable materials with tailored properties spanning commercial linear low&#8208;density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). These materials offer adjustable adhesive strength to metal and demonstrate chemical recyclability and selective depolymerization in mixed plastic streams, promoting circularity and separation.

An organoboron functionalized ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8208;organic nanosheet, termed TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS, featuring highly exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, and efficient substrates/products diffusion ability, which presents dramatically improved CO2 conversion to bioactive benzimidazoles via formate&#8208;assisted FLP&#8208;mediated catalysis pathway than the parent TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;3D counterpart.







Abstract
Converting CO2 to high&#8208;value fine chemicals represents one of the most promising approaches to combat global warming and subsequently achieve a sustainable carbon cycle. Herein, we contribute an organoboron functionalized ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8208;organic nanosheet (MON), termed TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS, featuring an abundance of exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, which can effectively promote CO2 conversion upon the addition of Lewis basic o&#8208;phenylenediamines. Compared with the prototypical 3D analogue TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;3D, the resultant TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS showcases dramatically improved catalytic activity for the cyclization of o&#8208;phenylenediamine as a result of the highly exposed active sites and efficient substrates/products diffusion. Strikingly, the incorporation of Lewis acidic B sites into ultra&#8208;thin Zr&#8208;based MON (Zr&#8208;MON) not only promotes the highly efficient CO2 conversion, but also enhances the recyclability/durability of catalysts. Additionally, the underlying catalytic mechanism has been well established by the comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, unveiling a formate&#8208;assisted frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) mediated catalytic pathway. This work opens up a new avenue to heterogeneous FLP&#8208;based catalysts for small molecule activation and beyond.

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally&#8208;Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy is designed to achieve on&#8208;demand orthogonally controlled stimulation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. The approach utilizes an engineered DNA motif with an enzymatically responsive moiety and a photocleavable linker into DNA motif, enabling enzyme&#8208;mediated activation and light&#8208;triggered termination of cGAS stimulation through dynamic DNA assembly.







Abstract
Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)&#8208;connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self&#8208;assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self&#8208;assembly of DNA motif into long double&#8208;stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1&#8208;regulated DNA assembly allows for cell&#8208;selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re&#8208;engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched &#8220;ON&#8221;), whereas light&#8208;mediated fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched &#8220;OFF&#8221;), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.

         <title>Ethane Triggered Gate&#8208;Opening in a Flexible&#8208;Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;High Purity Ethylene Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a flexible&#8208;robust MOF Zn(ad)(min) that features a unique localized flexible gate to priority adsorb the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecules, thus achieving the unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ethane/ethylene uptake ratio 3.34 (298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar), and the remarkable ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt;99.995&#8201;%) productivity up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg at ambient condition.







Abstract
Priority recognition separation of inert and larger ethane molecules from high&#8208;concentration ethylene mixtures instead of the traditional thermodynamic or size sieving strategy is a fundamental challenge. Herein, we report ethane triggered gate&#8208;opening in the flexible&#8208;robust metal&#8208;organic framework Zn(ad)(min), the 3&#8208;methylisonicotinic acid ligand can spin as a flexible gate when adsorbing the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecule, achieving an unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ethane/ethylene uptake ratio (3.34) under low&#8208;pressure region (0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K). The ethane&#8208;induced structural transition behavior has been uncovered by a collaboration of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ variable pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, elucidating the synergetic mechanism of cross&#8208;section matching and multiple supramolecular interactions within the tailor&#8208;made pore channels. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have revealed the outstanding separation performance of Zn(ad)(min) during the production of ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt;99.995&#8201;%) with a productivity of up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg under ambient conditions.

         <title>The Spin&#8208;Selective Channels in Fully&#8208;Exposed PtFe Clusters Enable Fast Cathodic Kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;dependent transition between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 is studied on a fully&#8208;exposed PtFe cluster catalyst. The fast spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer enabled by the directional e&#8208;spins at Fe&#8722;Fe sites, markedly accelerates the kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction. This work provides new insights into enhancing the cathodic kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 battery through spintronic electrocatalysis and constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.







Abstract
In Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs), the electron transfer between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 possesses a spin&#8208;dependent character but is still neglected, while the spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer without losing phase information should guarantee fast kinetics and reduced energy barriers. Here, we provide a paradigm of spin&#8208;selective catalysis for LOB that the ferromagnetic quantum spin exchange interactions between Pt and Fe atoms in fully&#8208;exposed PtFe clusters filter directional e&#8208;spins for spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer at Fe&#8722;Fe sites. The kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction is markedly accelerated as predicted by theoretical calculations, showing dramatically decreased relaxation time of the rate determining step for more than one order of magnitude, compared with the Fe clusters without spin&#8208;selective behavior. In consequence, the assembled LOB provides ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of 89.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under a discharge&#8208;charge overpotential of only 0.32&#8197;V. This work provides new insights into the spin&#8208;dependent mechanisms of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction, and the strategy of constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Asymmetric Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Unidirectional Low&#8208;Friction Water Collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia leaves, an unidirectional hydrophobic membrane characterized by a hydrophilic rough surface and nm&#8208;sized hydrophobic internal pore channels is successfully synthesized. The low&#8208;frictional resistance within the synthesized asymmetric COF membrane&#8242;s pore channels is quantified using low&#8208;field NMR. Ultimately, the resulting COF membranes efficiently capture fog from the air while simultaneously filtering small molecular pollutants.







Abstract
Friction plays a pivotal role in many phenomena of physical chemistry and has long been in the focus of research thereof. As a crucial parameter, friction in membranes&#8217; inner and/or outer surface can be minimized to reduce solvent inlet resistance and enlarge inner pore fluid flux, ideally reaching near frictionless transport of water at nanoscale. Inspired by the leaf structure of Tillandsia, a porous membrane with a rough surface and a hydrophilic inlet together with hydrophobic pore channels was designed and fabricated, based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Combined with COFs&#8217; inherent highly oriented pore structures, the as&#8208;made asymmetric membranes through chemical etching can minimize the solvent critical intrusion pressure and enable inner pore low friction water transport. Ultimately, obtained COF membranes succeeded in trapping fog from air and achieved a water harvesting rate (WHR) of 1570&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, together with small molecular pollutants filtrated off in the meantime. Intriguingly, the synthesized asymmetric COF membranes illustrated unidirectional low friction water collecting and transporting features, the successful imitation of T. macdougallii. This work presents a practical strategy to construct functional porous membranes for low friction water collection and transport, and created a model paradigm to design fluid transporting pore channels.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Open Pyrene Sites Isolated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Helical Chains for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>

The first microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which are functionalized by open pyrene sites, thereby exhibits exceptional Xe/Kr separation performance surpassing all previously reported HOF materials under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Achieving efficient xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation in emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is highly challenging because of the lack of gas&#8208;binding sites on their pore surfaces. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168) based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the pyrene core, thereby preserving open pyrene sites on the pore surfaces. Its activated form, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a is capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions while achieving an excellent balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity. At 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the Xe adsorption capacity of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a reached 78.31&#8197;cm3/g, with an Xe/Kr IAST selectivity of 22.0; both values surpass those of currently known top&#8208;performing HOFs. Breakthrough experiments confirmed its superior separation performance with a separation factor of 8.6 and a yield of high&#8208;purity Kr (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) of 184&#8197;mL/g. Furthermore HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168 exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as renewability. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling revealed that the unique electrostatic surface potential around the open pyrene sites creates a micro&#8208;electric field, exerting a stronger polarizing effect on Xe than on Kr, thereby enhancing host&#8208;Xe interactions.

         <title>Topotactic Transformation in Fe3O4 Induces Spontaneous Growth of Compositionally Diverse Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ambient conditions, the surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) inevitably transforms into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Instead of allowing an oxidation reaction, we use these topotactically transforming Fe3O4 NPs as reducing agents. Merely mixing the Fe3O4 solution with various oxidative metal salts spontaneously generates a variety of compositionally diverse nanostructures under mild conditions.







Abstract
Topotactic transformation is an emerging strategy for synthesizing materials with exotic functional properties. In this report, instead of producing new crystals with related structures, we exploited the topotactic transformation phenomenon to spontaneously produce compositionally diverse nanostructures on the transforming substrate. The surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) is topotactically transformed into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Benefiting from such oxidation susceptibility of ultrasmall Fe3O4 NPs, we achieved spontaneous growth of metals (Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd), a non&#8208;metal (Se), and a metal oxide (MnO2) based nanostructures onto the surface of Fe3O4. No spontaneous growth of nanostructures was observed when the oxidized Fe3O4 NPs were tested, likely due to the loss of the Fe2+&#8208;associated mobile electrons. The obtained nanostructures displayed appreciable antioxidant activities, which we utilized to effectively treat inflammation in the intestines. It is anticipated that this synthetic route, based on topotactic transformation, represents a significant advancement in synthesizing various chemically diverse hetero&#8208;nanostructures.

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8211;Vibration Coupling via Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing energy loss is crucial for overcoming the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is utilized to enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, and weakens exciton&#8211;vibration coupling strength. Therefore, the OSC devices based on Y&#8208;SeSe, featuring dual strong intramolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O noncovalent interactions, achieve outstanding photovoltaic performance and extremely small &#916;Enr.







Abstract
Minimizing energy loss is crucial for breaking through the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). The main mechanism of energy loss can be attributed to non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) that occurs due to exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. To tackle this challenge, tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is strategically utilized to tailor novel fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Upon comprehensive analysis of both theoretical and experimental results, this approach can effectively enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, reduce exciton reorganization energy, and weakens exciton&#8211;vibration coupling strength. Consequently, the binary OSC device based on Y&#8208;SeSe, which features dual strong intramolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O noncovalent interactions, achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.49&#8201;%, accompanied by an extremely small &#916;Enr of 0.184&#8197;eV, much lower than those of Y&#8208;SS and Y&#8208;SSe based devices with weaker intramolecular noncovalent interactions. These achievements not only set an efficiency record for selenium&#8208;containing OSCs, but also mark the lowest reported &#916;Enr value among high&#8208;performance binary devices. Furthermore, the ternary blend device showcases a remarkable PCE of 20.51&#8201;%, one of the highest PCEs for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of intramolecular noncovalent interactions in suppressing exciton&#8211;vibration coupling, thereby achieving low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>Towards Highly Stable Sn2+ Electrolyte for Aqueous Tin Batteries Using Hydroquinone Antioxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding antioxidant (hydroquinone) additives to acidic Sn2+ electrolyte, Sn2+ oxidation was suppressed due to the fact that hydroquinone is able to react with dissolved oxygen. Meanwhile, hydroquinone molecules tend to adsorb on electrode surface, resulted in refined deposition Sn particles and inhibition on dendrite growth. Finally, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% for Sn electrode can be obtained. This work can provide guidance for high stable Sn2+ electrolyte with high reversibility.







Abstract
Sn redox chemistry in aqueous acidic electrolyte was characterized with high reversibility and kinetics, which is considered as competitive anode material for aqueous batteries. Unfortunately, divalent Sn2+ is unstable in aqueous electrolyte. It was revealed that Sn2+ is easy to be oxidized to tetravalent Sn4+ by dissolved oxygen and then forms precipitate through hydrolysis process, leading to serious performance decay. Here, hydroquinone (HQ) was employed as antioxidant to prevent Sn2+ oxidation. With addition of HQ, Sn2+ electrolyte can maintain transparent and colorless after long&#8208;time exposure under air atmosphere, while large amounts of sediment were observed in the electrolyte without HQ. Moreover, HQ can adsorb on electrode surface to regulate Sn deposition and suppress Sn dendrite formation. With the difunctional HQ additive, Sn anode shows a stable cycling performance more than 1500 cycles with a high average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9&#8201;%. And the organic||Sn cell shows high cycling stability for 10,000 cycles with 71&#8201;% capacity retention. The hydroquinone antioxidant strategy provides a facile and cost&#8208;effective way to develop highly stable Sn2+&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Sugar Auxiliary Group Assisted Diversity&#8208;Oriented Enzymatic Modular Synthesis of 0&#8208;Series Ganglioside Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sugar auxiliary group assisted chain&#8208;elongation strategy was developed to overcome the limitation of bacterial &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase CjCgtA for the enzymatic synthesis of extended 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures. These core structures were then applied in the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain 0&#8208;series of ganglioside glycans by sequential glycosylation with a total of 8 enzyme modules.







Abstract
Owing to the inaccessibility of &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase for direct glycan chain elongation, the enzymatic synthesis of 0&#8208;series gangliosides with extended backbones has not been explored. In this study, sialic acid was enzymatically introduced as an auxiliary group to overcome the limitation of substrate specificity of Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CjCgtA) to achieve the synthesis of desired extended 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures, and the sialic acid auxiliary group could be removed by sialidase at appropriate stages. A bacterial &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium damselae (Pd2,6ST) exhibited unexpected acceptor substrate specificity for 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures, providing ready access to complex gangliosides bearing the sialyl N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine unit. The 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures as the key acceptor substrates were further diversified by sequential enzymatic modular assembly to generate a collection of 31&#8197;complex 0&#8208;series ganglioside glycans after removal of the sugar auxiliary group of sialic acid at the appropriate stage.

         <title>Heterochiral Self&#8208;Discrimination Driven Dimerization of Polynuclear Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Complexes with Enhanced Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) in a 1:1 ratio. The dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand.







Abstract
Decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) have been assembled by taking advantage of the judiciously selected SDP ligands (SDP = 7,7&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane). Interestingly, an achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 in a 1:1 ratio. These gold(I) complexes have been found to display intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with an emission maximum at around 750&#8197;nm in the solid state. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of mesoSDP&#8208;Au20 in drop&#8208;cast solid&#8208;state thin film has been found to show a significant enhancement from 8&#8201;% in the SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 to 25&#8201;%. In addition, the dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand. This work has provided a platform for the investigation and mechanistic understanding of heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and assembly processes.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Guanylation Reaction for Removing MACl Residual and In&#8208;Situ Forming 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) was added into perovskite precursor to solve the issues of methylammonium chloride (MACl) residual and in situ form two&#8208;dimensional perovskite by guanylation reaction between MCH and MACl, thus yielding high quality three&#8208;dimensional perovskite. The MCH&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells realized a 26.81&#8201;%&#8208;efficiency (certified 26.02&#8201;%) with excellent device stability.







Abstract
The thermodynamical deprotonation of methylammonium chloride (MACl) has several detrimental influences on the quality of formamidinium (FA+)&#8208;based perovskite, which limits both efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, a new additive strategy was developed by introducing methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) into perovskite precursor, where guanylation reaction occurred between MCH and MACl to form a new intermediate of methyl&#8208;substituted guanidine (MSG). MSG could then bond with undercoordinated Pb2+ to in situ form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite, which would promote the growth and crystallization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite with higher crystallinity, lower defect&#8208;states density and superior stability. Finally, the MCH&#8208;treated IPSC with a small area (0.09&#8197;cm2) achieved an impressive power conversation efficiency (PCE) of 26.81&#8201;% (certified as 26.02&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs reported to date. The large area MCH&#8208;treated device (1.00&#8197;cm2) also obtained a high PCE of 24.36&#8201;%. Moreover, the unencapsulated and MCH&#8208;treated device exhibited excellent operational stability, maintaining 91.95&#8201;% and 97.06&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after aging in air and a nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h. The encapsulated MCH&#8208;treated devices retained 94.25&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point for 1200&#8197;h in air.

The MCH-treated inverted perovskite solar cells realized a 26.81&#8201;%-efficiency (certified 26.02&#8201;%) with excellent device stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermodynamical deprotonation of methylammonium chloride (MACl) has several detrimental influences on the quality of formamidinium (FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-based perovskite, which limits both efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, a new additive strategy was developed by introducing methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) into perovskite precursor, where guanylation reaction occurred between MCH and MACl to form a new intermediate of methyl-substituted guanidine (MSG). MSG could then bond with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to in situ form a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite, which would promote the growth and crystallization of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite with higher crystallinity, lower defect-states density and superior stability. Finally, the MCH-treated IPSC with a small area (0.09&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) achieved an impressive power conversation efficiency (PCE) of 26.81&#8201;% (certified as 26.02&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs reported to date. The large area MCH-treated device (1.00&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) also obtained a high PCE of 24.36&#8201;%. Moreover, the unencapsulated and MCH-treated device exhibited excellent operational stability, maintaining 91.95&#8201;% and 97.06&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after aging in air and a nitrogen-filled atmosphere at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h. The encapsulated MCH-treated devices retained 94.25&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuously tracking at the maximum power-point for 1200&#8197;h in air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Oxide Clusters as Electron Donors Under Light Enhance Oxygen Reduction Kinetics at Atomically Dispersed Fe for Photocatalytic CH4 Partial Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

Fe SA&#8722;NC/C3N4 demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity for photocatalytic methane partial oxidation. Fe2O3 nanoclusters play a similar role as NADH coenzyme in soluble methane monooxygenase that continuously provide electrons under the illumination to the satellite Fe single atom sites, promoting O2 activation and subsequent CH4 oxidation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to CH3OH emerges as a promising strategy to sustainably utilize natural gas and mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, there remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of methanol by using O2 at low temperature. Inspired by the catalytic structure in soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) and the corresponding reaction mechanism, we prepared a biomimetic photocatalyst with the decoration of Fe2O3 nanoclusters and satellite Fe single atoms immobilized on carbon nitride. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity of 5.02&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with CH3OH selectivity of 98.5&#8201;%. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergy between Fe2O3 nanoclusters and Fe single atoms establishes a dual&#8208;Fe site as MMO for O2 activation and subsequent CH4 partial oxidation. Moreover, the light excitation of Fe2O3 nanoclusters with a relative narrow band gap could deliver the electrons and protons to atomic Fe that facilitating the oxygen reduction kinetics for the robust of CH3OH synthesis.

         <title>Oriented Growth of Highly Emissive Manganese Halide Microrods for Dual&#8208;Mode Low&#8208;Loss Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese(II) halide microrod crystals (TPS2MnCl4) are synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Owing to their high PLQY, smooth crystal surface, and negligible self&#8208;absorption, these TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited not only for optical waveguides but can serve as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in a single crystal.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structured lead&#8208;free metal halides have recently attracted widespread attention due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and negligible self&#8208;absorption, showing enormous potential as optical waveguides towards miniaturized photonic devices. However, due to the great difficulty in growth of rod&#8208;like nano/micro&#8208;sized morphologies, such applications have been less explored. Herein, a new&#8208;type emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese (II) halide crystal (TPS2MnCl4, TPS=C18H15S, triphenylsulfonium) in the form of microrods is synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Due to a combination of attractive features such as a high PLQY of 86&#8201;%, negligible self&#8208;absorption and smooth crystal surface, TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited for use in optical waveguide with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 1.20&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, superior to that of most organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide hybrids, organic materials, polymers and metal nanoclusters to the best of our knowledge. Importantly, TPS2MnCl4 microrods can further work as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in one single crystal. In addition, TPS2MnCl4 microrods also display remarkable performance in lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their distinct optical properties and commendable stability.

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr&#8208;exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite (Sr/K&#8208;HEU) zeolite exhibits molecular trapdoor effect and thereby achieves inverse separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 with benchmark selectivity, which provides new thoughts for gas separation by zeolites and improves current understanding of molecular trapdoor mechanism.







Abstract
The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96&#8197;mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of Sr/K&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the Cyclopiane Family of Diterpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis of cyclopiane and related diterpenes has been achieved in a three&#8208;stage manner. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were obtained by skeleton construction with an engineered heterologous host, followed by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D by direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation and enzymatic oxidation. Varied cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons were further obtained by chemical transformation and genome mining.







Abstract
A three&#8208;stage chemoenzymatic synthesis of the cyclopiane family and related diterpenes is reported. Deoxyconidiogenol with a 6/5/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic cyclopiane skeleton was first produced by an engineered E. coli host harboring the corresponding terpene cyclase PchDS. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were synthesized by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D of the cyclopiane skeleton through direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation, and enzymatic hydroxylation, respectively. Skeletal diversification was achieved by taking advantage of the selective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration of a cyclopiane cation generated chemically or enzymatically. Three cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons, including the spiro 5/5/5/5&#8208;tetracyclic skeleton of spiroviolene, the angular 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused ring system of phomopsene, and the new linear 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic ring system of amycolatene, were produced either by chemical skeletal transformation from the cyclopiane skeleton, or by terpene cyclases discovered by genome mining.

&lt;p&gt;Chemoenzymatic synthesis of cyclopiane and related diterpenes has been achieved in a three-stage manner. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were obtained by skeleton construction with an engineered heterologous host, followed by late-stage functionalization of rings A, B and D by direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation and enzymatic oxidation. Varied cyclopiane-related skeletons were further obtained by chemical transformation and genome mining.

         <title>Progressive Fabrication of a Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Catalyst toward Highly Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy catalyst (PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2) with greatly improved catalytic properties toward propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was progressively designed and fabricated. The well&#8208;balanced alloying effects and high configurational entropy (&#916;Smix) concertedly created abundant isolated Pt sites, conducive to striking activity, high selectivity, and superior stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as burgeoning heterogeneous catalysts due to their vast material space, unique structure, and superior stability. However, the dominant trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches hamper the exploration of efficient catalysts, necessitating the development of rational design strategies. Here, we report a progressive approach to the design and fabrication of HEA catalysts guided by alloying effects toward propane dehydrogenation. Cu, Sn, Au, and Pd are selected and demonstrated to induce dilution, encapsulation, surface enrichment, and inhomogeneity effects on Pt. The fabricated HEA, PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability. The propylene formation rates reach 256 and 390 molC3H6 gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 550 and 600&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Systematic characterizations reveal that the random elemental mixing, structural stability, and high Pt exposure promote the exposure of abundant stable isolated Pt sites. This work comprehensively explores the rational design and fabrication of HEA catalysts from a unique perspective, offering opportunities for developing advanced catalysts.

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free Two&#8208;Coordinate Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free, two coordinate oxoborane (R&#8208;BO) has been isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3 and shown to react in a unique way with PhN3. In contrast to the parent oxoborane, the oxoborane&#8594;AlCl3 adduct is stable towards oligomerisation and C&#8722;H cleavage of the Mes* group as AlCl3 coordination provides thermodynamic stabilization while also reducing the basicity of the oxygen unit thus reducing the biphilic character of the BO unit.







Abstract
Oxoboranes (R&#8208;BO) are transient species that rapidly trimerise to form boroxines. To date, the only method used to stabilise oxoboranes is to add a Lewis base, but this forms a three&#8208;coordinate at boron oxoborane that has a different bonding/reactivity profile. Herein we report a base&#8208;free, two&#8208;coordinate oxoborane that is isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3. This species, Mes*BO&#8208;AlCl3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2), has a &#957;11&#914;&#927; stretching frequency of 1843&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a strong BO bond. Computational analysis indicates this is due to a highly polarised BO bonding interaction combined with modest BO multiple bond character. While the polarisation of the BO bond on AlCl3 coordination enhances the Lewis acidity at boron it also reduces the basicity at oxygen and the latter is key to accessing a base&#8208;free oxoborane. Finally, this oxoborane reacts with PhN3 in a unique way to form an unprecedented boron heterocycle.

         <title>Switching Residues: A Platform for the Synthesis of Fidaxomicin Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching residues: Adding new substituents to natural products increases their molecular weight and often their lipophilicity. We developed a Pd&#8208;catalysed protocol to directly replace the rhamnoside&#8208;arene fragment of the antibiotic fidaxomicin with simple amines in 1 step from the unprotected natural product. This enabled direct access to Fdx derivatives of reduced complexity with activity against RNA polymerase and various bacteria.







Abstract
Peripheral modification is often the main approach to optimize natural products for improved biological activity or desired physicochemical properties. This procedure inevitably increases molecular weight, often accompanied by undesired increased lipophilicity. Removing structural elements from natural products is not always tolerated. This is also the case for the antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx), where every structural component has been shown to be crucial for antibiotic activity. In this work, we demonstrate how the residue switching approach can maintain biological activity of Fdx derivatives by replacing the rhamnoside&#8208;dichlorohomoorsellinate moiety of Fdx with smaller, more polar building blocks. We used palladium&#8208;catalysed allylic substitution to selectively install N&#8208;nucleophiles on the core of Fdx. The new derivatives were designed to mimic the binding of Fdx to the bacterial RNA polymerase. Evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Clostridioides difficile, and the Gram&#8208;negative model organism Caulobacter crescentus demonstrated that the newly introduced residues can restore antibiotic activity, which was further supported by on&#8208;target RNA polymerase assays. We combined the allylic substitution with an organocatalysed novioside acylation protocol to enable the functionalisation of two vectors on Fdx in one pot. This platform greatly expands the accessible chemical space for Fdx derivatives and enables the future development of systemic Fdx antibiotics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing 2D Anion&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Temperature Water Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing halogen anions as connecting nodes, new 2D reticulate honeycomb anion&#8208;organic frameworks were synthesized through a simple, green in situ protonation and crystallization method using pyridine&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine derivatives. These frameworks feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal channels and exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing properties, high water uptake, and low water release onset temperatures.







Abstract
Molecular frameworks have recently shown a great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, in which the water release at low temperatures is challenging. Anion&#8208;organic frameworks based on anion&#8208;coordination chemistry are presented herein to meet this challenge. These frameworks are prepared as tubular single crystals in pure water from the in situ protonation and crystallization of pyridine&#8208;terminated triphenylamine derivatives with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7&#8211;2.3&#8197;nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water&#8208;stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self&#8208;healing capability. This discovery opens opportunities for the design and synthesis of flexible and self&#8208;healing frameworks for porosity&#8208;related applications.

They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7&#8211;2.3&#8197;nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water-stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self-healing capability. This discovery opens opportunities for the design and synthesis of flexible and self-healing frameworks for porosity-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen Radical&#8208;Activated Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Buried Heterointerface for Achieving Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Tin&#8208;Based Solar Cells with Efficiencies Surpassing 14&#8201;%</title>

The highly active halogen radicals simultaneously modified the ITO surface and chemically bridged the ITO/perovskite heterointerfaces for largely reducing the interfacial energy barrier and optimizing the interfacial carrier dynamics in hole transport layer&#8208;free Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving a record efficiency of 14.20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Sn&#8208;based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally&#8208;friendly photovoltaic materials owing to their low toxicity and exceptional optoelectronic properties. Nonetheless, the low&#8208;cost production and stable operation of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still largely limited by the costly hole transport materials and the under&#8208;optimized interfaces between hole transport layer (HTL) and Sn perovskite layer. Here, we innovatively developed a chlorine radical chemical bridging (Cl&#8208;RCB) strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite heterointerface for constructing high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based PSCs with simplified structures. The key is to modify the commercially&#8208;purchased ITO electrode with highly active chlorine radicals that could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down&#8208;shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier has been largely reduced by 0.20&#8197;eV and the interfacial carrier dynamics have been optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface. Encouragingly, the efficiency of HTL&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based PSCs has been enhanced from 6.79&#8201;% to 14.20&#8201;%, which is on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conventional HTL&#8208;containing counterparts (normally &gt;14&#8201;% efficiency) and representing the record performance for the Sn perovskite photovoltaics in the absence of HTL. Notably, the target device exhibited enhanced stability for up to 2000&#8197;h. The Cl&#8208;RCB strategy is also versatile to be used in Pb&#8208;based and mixed Sn&#8722;Pb HTL&#8208;free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27&#8201;% and 21.13&#8201;%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer&#8208;free PSCs with simplified device architectures.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Level Alignment at TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 Interface for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal oxide&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors suffer from high operating temperatures and poor selectivity. The TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (x = 0, 1, or 2) heterojunctions enhance sensing performance through energy level modulation. TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 detects NO2 at 1 ppb in &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature, exhibiting high selectivity and stability, thereby underscoring the role of energy band engineering in the advancement of sensor performance.







Abstract
Metal oxide (MO)&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors have great potential in environmental monitoring, security protection, and disease diagnosis. However, the thermally activated sensing mechanism in pristine MOs leads to high working temperature and poor selectivity, which are the main challenges impeding practical applications. Precise modulation of the band structure at the heterojunction interfaces of MOs offers the opportunity to unlock unique electrical and optical properties, enabling us to overcome these challenges. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable structures are promising materials for aligning the energy levels at the heterojunctions of MOs. Herein, we report the energy&#8208;level structural engineering of MO@MOF heterojunctions to optimize chemiresistive sensing performance. The interface was flexibly modulated from a straddling gap to a staggered gap by &#8208;NH2 functionalization of TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, varying x from 0 to 1 and 2, respectively. TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 combines the advantages of MOs and MOFs to synergistically improve gas&#8208;sensing properties. As a result, TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 is the first light&#8208;activated material to detect NO2 at 1 ppb with a response time of &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature. It also exhibited excellent selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. Our study underscores the potential of energy band engineering in creating high&#8208;performance sensors, offering a strategy to overcome current material limits.

         <title>Photoinduced Energy/Electron Transfer within Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

Photoinduced energy/electron transfer (PET) is critically enhanced by confining the reactive molecules within a single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) environment.







Abstract
We demonstrate that single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) &#8211; compact covalently folded single polymer chains &#8211; can increase photocatalytic performance of an embedded catalytic center, compared to the comparable catalytic system in free solution. In particular, we demonstrate that the degree of compaction allows to finely tailor the catalytic activity, thus evidencing that molecular confinement is a key factor in controlling photocatalysis. Specifically, we decorate a linear parent polymer with both photoreactive chalcone moieties as well as Ru(bpy)3 catalytic centers. We initially construct a SCNP via a photosensitized [2+2] cycloaddition at 510&#8197;nm and demonstrate that the SCNP formation is substantially more efficient when the Ru(bpy)3 units are part of the polymer chain instead of as free molecules in solution. Subsequently, we employ the same Ru(bpy)3 units as photocatalysts in a model reaction employing pyrene units as charge transfer moieties. We establish that the photocatalytic activity increases as the polymer becomes more compact, reaching peak efficiency, followed by a subsequent decline as the SCNP becomes too compact. Thus, we identify a goldilocks regime of catalyst confinement via SCNP compaction for use in photocatalysis.

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;Packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship in high mobility emissive materials was revealed that a centroid distance of about 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for achieving high mobility and strong emission in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates simultaneously based on four quinoline&#8208;anthracene isomers. This relationship also demonstrates the broad applicability and universal potential in other organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors. However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8211;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline-substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone-packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone-packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH-&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8211;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone-packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semiconductive Coordination Polymer with Multi&#8208;Channel Charge Transfer for High&#8208;Performance Direct X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of linker mediated electronic&#8208;state regulation was proposed to construct a CP with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer. This strategy reduced carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhanced the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. The semiconductive detector achieves the high mobility&#8208;lifetime product and the low detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate, which makes the record for CPs&#8208;based direct radiation detection.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) are promising for direct X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to higher designability and outstanding stability, however, it remains a challenge to achieve highly X&#8208;ray detection performance, particularly both high sensitivity and low detection limit at the same operating voltage. Herein, we construct a new conjugated CP {[Co(BPTTz)(DIPA)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMA}n (1, BPTTz=2,5&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, H2DIPA=2,5&#8208;diiodoterephthalic acid, DMA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacetamide), with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer by regulating the linker mediated electronic&#8208;state, which reduces carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhances the efficiency of charge separation and transfer, thus further optimizes X&#8208;ray detection performance. The semiconductor prepared based on this strategy achieves record values including the highest mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;, 8.05&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) and the lowest detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate (128&#8197;nGyair&#8201;S&#8722;1, 35&#8197;V) among CP&#8208;based direct radiation detectors, as well as a high sensitivity (172&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 35&#8197;V) at the same operating voltage. This detector shows excellent long&#8208;time air stability under ambient conditions for over three months and operational stability. These findings demonstrate a rational structural design method to enhance the photoelectronic efficiency and stability of semiconductive CPs.

         <title>Negative Thermal Expansion Behavior Enabling Good Electrochemical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Performance at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new and effective strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issue of metal&#8208;ion batteries. When the operation temperature decreases, the lattice parameters of an NTE material increases, leading to its fast ion diffusivity, high electrochemical kinetics, high rate capability, and good cycling stability at low temperatures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ion batteries (such as lithium&#8208;ion batteries) are very popular energy&#8208;storage devices nowadays. However, low temperatures cause their poor electrochemical kinetics and performance, significantly limiting their wide applications in cold environments. Here, we propose that electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issues of metal&#8208;ion batteries. LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) with an a&#8208;direction thermal expansion coefficient of &#8722;1.1&#215;10&#8722;&#8197;K&#8722;1 is used as a model material. As the temperature decreases, the transverse vibration of O atoms not only increases the transverse distances among O atoms connected to Li/Ti atoms, but also widens the Li+&#8208;transport channels and enlarges the Li+&#8208;insertion sites along the [12

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



] direction, which are mainly controlled by the lattice parameter a. Consequently, carbon&#8208;coated LTP (C&#8211;LTP) retains good electrochemical performance at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C, including fast Li+ diffusivity (84&#8201;% of that at 25&#8201;&#176;C), large capacity (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), and superior rate capability (83&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C vs. 0.5&#8197;C). Moreover, the more open crystal structure of LTP at the lower temperature allows smaller maximum unit&#8208;cell&#8208;volume expansion, resulting in better cycling stability of C&#8211;LTP at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (96.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C).

         <title>Self&#8208;adaptive Coordination Evolution Mediated Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partition in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>

Pore space partition (PSP) has been successfully achieved in two isomorphic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on low&#8208;symmetric M4 clusters, which provides new perspectives for MOF structural regulation and designing more advanced porous adsorbents.







Abstract
The controllable and precise structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on isoreticular chemistry is an effective strategy for creating functional material platforms, such as efficient porous adsorbents. Herein, for the first time, mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on pseudo&#8208;D2h&#8208;symmetric [M4(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(COO)6] (M=Mn/Fe) clusters, two pore space partitioned MOFs (CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe, CTGU=China Three Gorges University) have been successfully constructed. Owing to the more confined adsorption space and dense binding sites produced by pore space partitioning (PSP), the CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe exhibit significantly enhanced performance in the capture or recovery SF6 (greenhouse/electronic specialty gas) from SF6/N2 mixture compared to their non&#8208;partitioned homologous structures (CTGU&#8208;46&#8208;Mn/Fe) with adsorption selectivity increased from 37/72 to 634/157 (v/v, 10/90, 100&#8197;kPa). The theoretical calculations also elucidated that the implementation of PSP within CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe leads to dramatically strengthened binding affinity for SF6 over N2 through extra multiple F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. This study represents a valuable advance in crystal engineering field: the SACE of polynuclear metal clusters is expected to be useful in the structural regulation of MOFs and the fabrication of advanced porous adsorbents.

We discovered that the non&#8208;conjugated piperazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione unit fully tautomerizes into the conjugated 3,6&#8208;dihydropyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol unit via a long&#8208;range vinylogous effect, driven by energy minimization through &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization along the polymer backbone. This fully conjugated backbone enhances charge transport, while lactim units strongly interact with fluoride ions, making this polymer effective in water&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor fluoride sensors.







Abstract
Piperazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (glycine anhydride, GA) has recently emerged as a valuable precursor for high&#8208;performance &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer semiconductors in organic electronics. We utilized GA to design a novel bisindolin&#8208;dihydropiperazine (IDHP)&#8208;based conjugated polymer, PIDHPTT, for aqueous chemical sensing. In the isatin&#8208;flanked monomer, GA exists as a non&#8208;conjugated lactam (DHP&#8208;NH) but converts to a conjugated lactim (DHP&#8208;OH) form within the polymer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that this conversion is driven by energy minimization via extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Neighboring DHP units in the lactim form facilitate this process through &#960;&#8208;bridges, demonstrating a vinylogous effect, which has previously only been observed in small molecules. This is the first study to report such a long&#8208;range vinylogous effect in a polymer due to the collective synergy of numerous functional groups. The OH groups in the lactim DHP interact more strongly with fluoride ions than other halides. PIDHPTT exhibits significant changes in optical absorption, electrochemical impedance, and charge transport in response to fluoride ions, which differ from responses to other halides. A water&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistor based on PIDHPTT shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity for fluoride ions, demonstrating the potential of this polymer design for chemical sensing applications.

         <title>An Interstitial Boron Inserted Metastable Hexagonal Rh Nanocrystal for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable hexagonal Rh nanocrystal catalyst is synthesized via interstitial boron insertion for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The insertion of boron atoms into Rh lattice not only induces phase transition from face&#8208;centered cubic to hexagonal close&#8208;packed, but also optimized adsorbed behaviors of reaction intermediates, leading to improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks and enhanced HOR performance.







Abstract
Constructing metastable phase structure plays an important role in changing the physicochemical properties and improving the catalytic performance of nanocrystals. Unfortunately, the synthesis of metastable phase metallic nanocrystals is highly challenging, mainly due to the thermodynamically unstable ground&#8208;state. Here, we report a synthesis of unconventional metastable hexagonal rhodium nanocrystal (Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C) via interstitial boron insertion. The insertion of boron atoms into the interstitial sites of cubic Rh lattice not only induces the atomic arrangements from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), but also stabilizes the metastable hexagonal Rh structure. Benefiting from the phase transition and interstitial boron doping, the Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.413&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;gPGM&#8722;1. Experimental measurements including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strengthened adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface of Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C is responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and increased water proportions in the gap region in the electric double layers. As a result, the increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network facilitate high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen transfer across the interface, thereby boost the alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Emission Utilizing Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism of photon&#8208;upconversion using a spin&#8208;flip process was proposed and demonstrated by combining a triplet sensitizer and a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecule. The triplet energy transfer from the green phosphorescent emitter (Ir(ppy)3) to the blue TADF emitter (CzBSe) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion (PUC) processes in organic molecular systems, such as triplet&#8208;triplet upconversion and hot&#8208;band absorption, are promising technologies for future energy harvesting. Although these processes can generate high&#8208;energy excitons compared to excitation energy, a PUC process with a high yield and no energy loss has not been established and, therefore, is highly desired. Here, we propose an alternative PUC mechanism that uses reverse intersystem crossing on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. This process combines a triplet sensitizer and a TADF molecule, generating a triplet in the former and transferring it to the latter. Specifically, the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 (sensitizer) to CzBSe (TADF) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV. We found that the triplet energy transfer rate strongly depends on the triplet radiative decay rate of TADF molecules and the difference in Gibbs energy between the energy acceptor and donor. Our findings will contribute to understanding triplet energy transfer dynamics in organic energy donor&#8208;acceptor systems and will lead to various applications, such as future optical cooling systems.

         <title>Pseudohalide Anions Driven Structural Modulation in Distorted Tetrahedral Manganese(II) Hybrids Toward Tunable Green&#8208;Red Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8722;x are introduced with R=phenyl, pentyl, or methyl, and x=1&#8211;3, synthesized by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). These hybrids show significant Stokes shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission (549&#8211;613&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;based halides have recently garnered significant interest as emerging luminescence materials for diverse photonic applications. Generally, Mn(II) hybrids with tetrahedral coordination show green emission, however, ones with octahedral coordination give red emission. Herein, we design the synthesis of tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8722;x (R=phenyl, pentyl or methyl; Ph3P=triphenylphosphine; x=1&#8211;3), achieved by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). Compared to the green&#8208;emitting A2MnBr4 (512&#8197;nm), the mixed hybrids exhibit significantly distorted [MnBrxNCS4&#8722;X] tetrahedra with high dipole moment, thus leading to the distinct Stokes shift energies and noticeable red shift emission in the range of 549&#8211;613&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Mn distance. These findings highlight the critical role of dipole moments in determining the emission properties and expand the luminescent family of Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids.

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) delivers small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to enhance radiotherapy. CMOL@siRNAs not only increases energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation, but also effectively delivers an siRNA cocktail to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. CMOL@siRNAs plus X&#8208;ray irradiation shows remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models.







Abstract
Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9&#8201;% and 91.4&#8201;% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Distonic Radical Cation Reactivity in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox activation of D&#8722;A cyclopropanes is unlocked, leading to distonic radical cations for a traditionally polarity&#8208;mismatched [3+2] cycloaddition with unactivated olefins. Further extension leads to facile access of cyclopentenes as well as bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by [&#963;+&#960;] and [&#963;+&#963;] cycloaddition respectively.







Abstract
Altering the reactivity model of a molecule can potentially eliminate limitations existing in its current paradigm. When it comes to the activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes (DACs), Lewis acids have been the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Although a variety of polarized 2&#960; components have been successfully coupled with DACs for [3+2] cycloaddition, unpolarized alkenes prove to be a roadblock due to an inherent polarity mismatch with the Lewis acid&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediate. Hereby, harnessing the distonic radical cation mode of cleavage by photoredox catalysis overcomes this mismatched reactivity of the zwitterionic intermediate, providing a unique route to highly substituted cyclopentanes and cyclopentenes. Expansion of this strategy to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes enables access to bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHs) through a facile [3&#963;+2&#963;] cycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic insights are also provided using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory.

         <title>Twisted&#8208;Planar Molecular Engineering with Sonication&#8208;Induced J&#8208;Aggregation To Design Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregates for Enhanced Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted&#8208;planar molecular design together with a sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation strategy has been used to develop MTSIC J&#8208;aggregates, with the absorption red&#8208;shifting from 620&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. MTSIC undergoes kinetic assembly from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and eventually to stable J&#8208;aggregates. MTSIC J&#8208;dots showed enhanced fluorescence as well as photodynamic and photothermal effects for cancer phototherapy.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates show great promise in phototherapy, but are limited to specific molecular skeletons and poor molecular self&#8208;assembly controllability. Herein, we report a twisted&#8208;planar molecular strategy with sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation to develop donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type J&#8208;aggregates for phototherapy. With propeller aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) moieties as the twisted subunits and thiophene as the planar &#960;&#8208;bridge, the optimal twisted&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;interaction in MTSIC induces appropriate slip angle and J&#8208;aggregates formation, redshifting the absorption from 624&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. In contrast, shorter &#960;&#8208;planarity results in amorphous aggregates, and elongation promotes charge transfer (CT) coupled J&#8208;aggregates. Sonication was demonstrated to be effective in controlling self&#8208;assembly behaviors of MTSIC, which enables the transformation from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and finally to stable J&#8208;aggregates. After encapsulation with lipid&#8208;PEG, the resultant J&#8208;dots show enhanced phototherapeutic effects over amorphous dots, including brightness, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and photothermal conversion, delivering superior cancer phototherapy performance. This work not only advances D&#8211;A type J&#8208;aggregates design but also provides a promising strategy for supramolecular assembly development.

         <title>Chiral Rotaxane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers as Relays in Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting system that shows sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances has been constructed from chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers. This approach not only leads to efficient amplification of the CPL performances but will also allow the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.







Abstract
Starting from AIEgen&#8208;functionalized chiral [2]rotaxane building block, we have successfully synthesized a new class of chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers through controllable divergent strategy for the first time, based on which novel chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHSs) were successfully constructed in aqueous phase by sequentially introducing achiral donor and acceptor. More importantly, accompanied by the two&#8208;step F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the resultant artificial LHSs, the sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances were achieved, highlighting that the chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers could serve as excellent relay for both energy transfer and chirality transmission. Impressively, compared with the sole chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values of the resultant artificial LHSs were amplified by one order of magnitude up to 0.038, enabling their further applications in information storage and encryption. The proof&#8208;of concept study provides not only a feasible approach for the efficient amplification of CPL performances but also a novel platform for the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;level Modulation of N, S&#8208;Co&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Selective Aqueous Catalytic Oxidation of Ethylbenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly method is observed to synthesize nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active heteroatom species at molecular level. It is proposed that the doping of pyridinic&#8208;N and thiophene&#8208;S can notably change the charge and spin densities, promoting the chemical reactivity of adjacent carbon atoms and reducing the reaction energy barrier effectively.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes into high value&#8208;added products through benzylic C&#8722;H bond activation is one of the main reactions in chemical industry. On account of the constantly increasing demand for mass production, efficient, eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we describe a facile and versatile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly strategy towards molecular&#8208;level fabrication of co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active N and S species. The method enables a high degree of control over nanoparticle sizes, mesoporous nanostructures, contents of heteroatoms and the chemical composition. The optimized catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance of 97&#8201;% ethylbenzene conversion and 98&#8201;% selectivity to acetophenone. Density functional theory simulations reveal that N, S&#8208;co&#8208;doping leads to the redistribution of charge and spin densities, introducing more active carbon atoms and realizing aerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene efficiently. This work presents a general strategy for molecular&#8208;level design of carbon&#8208;based catalysts, and also provides new insight into the influence of heteroatom&#8208;doping on catalytic properties.

The optimized catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance of 97&#8201;% ethylbenzene conversion and 98&#8201;% selectivity to acetophenone. Density functional theory simulations reveal that N, S-co-doping leads to the redistribution of charge and spin densities, introducing more active carbon atoms and realizing aerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene efficiently. This work presents a general strategy for molecular-level design of carbon-based catalysts, and also provides new insight into the influence of heteroatom-doping on catalytic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Norbornadiene&#8208;Derived Infrared Transparent Polymers by Inverse Vulcanization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the synthesis of infrared (IR) transmission polymers via inverse vulcanization of a novel norbornadiene derivative cross&#8208;linker (DMMD) with elemental sulfur. The resulting polymers exhibit high thermal stability and exceptional IR transmittance, The feasibility of large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Fresnel lens fabrication underscores their potential for IR optical applications, offering a promising strategy for achieving balanced thermal and optical properties in IR transparent polymer materials.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) transparent polymer materials prepared by inverse vulcanization, as a promising candidate to replace inorganic materials, are new materials for constructing key devices in IR optics. However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between infrared optical and thermal properties in polymers due to the intrinsic infrared absorption of organic materials. Herein, our strategy is to construct a high boiling point symmetrical molecular norbornadiene derivative cross&#8208;linking agent (DMMD) which can be inverse vulcanized with molten sulfur, and obtain Poly (S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) with different sulfur content by controlling the feed ratio of sulfur. With the rigid core and low IR activity in DMMD, the prepared polymers exhibit tunable thermal properties (Tg: 98.3&#8211;119.8&#8201;&#176;C) and high IR transmittance (medium&#8208;wave infrared region (MWIR): 42.9&#8211;52.6&#8201;%; long&#8208;wave infrared region (LWIR): 1.5&#8211;5.29&#8201;%). In addition, Poly (S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) can be used to prepare large&#8208;size free&#8208;standing Fresnel lenses for IR imaging by simple hot&#8208;pressing, which provides flexibility in the design and production of IR fine lenses. This study provides a novel strategy for balancing the thermal and optical properties of IR transparent polymer materials, while providing relevant references for balancing the IR optical and thermal properties of polymer materials.

         <title>Aliphatic Amines Unlocked for Selective Transformations through Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established state of knowledge, synthetically useful diazotation of aliphatic amines is possible. The key of this process is the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent. It improves the selectivity of the process and enables the transformation of the intermediates into the desired Friedel&#8211;Crafts products. In this way, after more than 150&#8197;years, also the diazotation of aliphatic amines is gaining its place in synthesis.







Abstract
While aromatic diazonium salts are important reagents in organic synthesis, &#8216;Diazonium ions generated from ordinary aliphatic primary amines are usually useless for preparative purposes, since they lead to a mixture of products giving not only substitution by any nucleophile present, but also elimination and rearrangements if the substrate permits.&#8217;1 In this work, we report that this statement is no longer valid, and it is now possible to control diazotization of aliphatic amines by utilizing isopentyl nitrite in HFIP. This transformation enabled electrophilic aromatic substitution with these highly abundant and commercially available alkyl reagents, as well as transforming them into building blocks typically employed in organic synthesis. The methodology opens an avenue for reactions involving aliphatic amines, even such demanding substrates as amino acids, as a source of carbocations thus expanding the degree of chemical space.

         <title>Reaction Pathway Regulation for Gaseous and Liquid Products of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Adsorbate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for gaseous and liquid products were regulated on well&#8208;defined Ag/Cu catalysts with controlled chlorination, influenced by the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate. The Ag/AgCl can convert CO2 into CO with a high selectivity, while Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu catalyst enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency nearing 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we reveal for the first time the distinct pathway switching between gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8722;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a high selectivity over a broad potential range in a 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) nearing 100&#8201;%, delivering high current densities of 136.3 and 20.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.3&#8197;V, respectively. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8722;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.

         <title>Zwitterionic 2&#8208;Phosphaethene&#8208;thiolates [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ as PCS Building Blocks (LC=NHC, LP=PR3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCS building blocks: This work presents the facile synthesis of zwitterionic salts [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)][OTf], which function as convenient, regioselective and multifaceted synthons of the PCS moiety. DFT calculations support a zwitterionic composition with a negative PCS moiety and two cationic P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents. Depending on the nature of the C&#8208;bound substituent, different reactivity can be addressed in cycloaddition and reduction reactions.







Abstract
The zwitterionic compounds [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ (3+, LC=NHC, LP=PR3), featuring cationic substituents at the phosphorus and carbon atoms, are synthesized as their triflate salts at a multi&#8208;gram scale from the reaction of Lewis base adducts of CS2, namely LC/P&#8722;CS2 (4), with a combination of [(LCP)4][OTf]4 (1[OTf]4) and Ph3P. The feasibility of using 3+ as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph3PCH2), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the S&#8208; and P&#8208;terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that 3+ can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag2(OTf)3&#8208;&#956;2:&#954;P,&#954;S&#8722;((LC)P=CS(PCy3))]+ (6&#8201;b), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of 3+ facilitates the cleavage of the P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&#8722; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of 3+ with 1[OTf]4 are shown to selectively yield five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8722;S bond in [(LC)P=CS(LC)]+, resulting in the formation of [(LC)P=C(LC)&#8722;P(LC)][OTf]2, 12[OTf]2, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&#954;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;((L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=CS(PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates the cleavage of the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;[OTf]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are shown to selectively yield five- and eight-membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8722;S bond in [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=CS(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in the formation of [(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)P=C(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8722;P(L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;)][OTf]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;[OTf]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Klebsiella pneumoniae Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads Based on Semi&#8208;Synthetic O1 and O2ac Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycans resembling lipopolysaccharides of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) strains O1 and O2ac were chemically synthesized. The 27 glycans were used to screen the sera of infected patients and controls for antibody binding. The glycan array study identified epitopes for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines against K. pneumoniae.







Abstract
Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a common opportunistic pathogen that emerged as a new critical threat to human health, due to its hypervirulence and widespread resistance against many antibiotics, including carbapenems. Alternative intervention strategies such as vaccines are not available. Cell&#8208;surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are attractive targets for vaccine development. We present a method to synthesize LPS substructures, covering over 70&#8201;% of virulent KP strains that were used to characterize the antibody repertoire of infected patients. Thereby, glycoconjugate vaccine leads against the Klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes O1, O2a, O2afg and O2ac have been identified.

Operationally convenient one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed and enantioselective one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylidenecylcopropanes are developed to prepare racemic and enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respectively.

Abstract
An operationally convenient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step hydrosilylation/hydroboration reaction of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access racemic 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes. In addition, the corresponding asymmetric reaction is developed with a chiral copper catalyst to prepare 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high enantioselectivity by a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure. Mechanistic studies reveal that this difunctionalization process begins with metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of arylidenecyclopropanes to generate homoallylsilane intermediates, followed by regio&#8208; or enantioselective metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of homoallylsilanes to produce skipped borylsilylalkanes. Selective transformations of C&#8722;B and Si&#8722;H bonds in skipped borylsilylalkane products are also demonstrated.

         <title>Controlled Lipid Domain Positioning and Polarization in Confined Minimal Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic confinement of phase&#8208;separating giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) directs the accumulation of the minority&#8208;phase domains in the free regions where they fuse to minimize their line energy. This results in the localization of lipid domains at prescribed positions and the possibility to build polarized cell models with a control over the number and position of the poles.







Abstract
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are widely used minimal cell models where essential biological features can be reproduced, isolated and studied. Although precise spatio&#8208;temporal distribution of membrane domains is a process of crucial importance in living cells, it is still highly challenging to generate anisotropic GUVs with domains at user&#8208;defined positions. Here we describe a novel and robust method to control the spatial position of lipid domains of liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo)/liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phase in giant unilamellar vesicles. Our strategy consists in confining Lo/Ld phase&#8208;separating GUVs in microfluidic channels to define free curved regions where the minority&#8208;phase domains localize and coalesce by decreasing the line energy through domain fusion. We show that this process is governed by the respective fraction of the two phases, and not by the chemical nature of the lipids involved. The spatial position and number of domains are controlled by the design of the confining microchannel and could result in polarized GUVs with a controllable number of poles. The developed method is versatile and user&#8208;friendly, while allowing multiple single&#8208;vesicle experiments in parallel.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Spiropyran Exchange for Rapid Structural Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiropyrans engage in exchange equilibria with indolinium salts that lead to exchange of the indoline fragments or catalyze spiropyran cross exchange, thereby providing a powerful tool for rapid structural diversification and access to novel spiropyran derivatives.







Abstract
Here we disclose that spiropyrans are able to undergo dynamic covalent exchange via their corresponding merocyanine isomers. In the latter, the indolinium moieties can be exchanged by a Michael&#8208;type addition&#8208;elimination sequence, in which a methylene indoline attacks a merocyanine and subsequently the initial indoline fragment is cleaved. The rate and position of the exchange equilibrium strongly depend on the reaction conditions as well as the substitution pattern on the methylene indoline fragments. Importantly, spiropyran cross exchange is catalyzed by indolinium salts and provides the opportunity for rapid in situ structural diversification of spiropyrans. This was used as synthetic tool to access various, hitherto inaccessible spiropyrans as potential dual&#8208;color photoinitiators for xolography. Moreover, we foresee application to screen dynamic covalent libraries of spiropyrans for photochromic properties and to exploit their light&#8208;sensitivity to bias the thermal equilibrium.

         <title>Structural and Functional Characterization of an Amidase Targeting a Polyurethane for Sustainable Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Global plastic production has surged in recent decades, leading to significant environmental waste. With a focus on polyurethane (PUR), the high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase SP3 in a product&#8208;bound state has been solved. Kinetic studies and enzyme engineering guided by the structure identified key structural elements that enhance urethanase activity, thereby supporting future PUR degradation and sustainable recycling efforts.







Abstract
Global plastic production exceeded 400 million tons in 2022, urgently demanding improved waste management and recycling strategies for a circular plastic economy. While the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become feasible on industrial scales, efficient enzymes targeting other hydrolyzable plastic types, such as polyurethanes (PURs), are lacking. Recently, enzymes of the amidase signature (AS) family, capable of cleaving urethane bonds in a polyether&#8208;PUR analog and a linear polyester&#8208;PUR, have been identified. Herein, we present high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the AS enzyme UMG&#8208;SP3 in three states: ligand&#8208;free, bound with a suicidal inhibitor mimicking the transition state, and bound with a monomeric PUR degradation product. Besides revealing the conserved core and catalytic triad akin to other AS family members, the UMG&#8208;SP3 structures show remarkable flexibility of loop regions. Particularly, Arg209 in loop 3 adopts two induced&#8208;fit conformations upon ligand binding. Through structure&#8208;guided kinetic studies and enzyme engineering, we mapped structural key elements that determine the enhanced hydrolysis of urethane and amide bonds in various small molecules, including a linear PUR fragment analog. Our findings contribute critical insights into urethanase activity, aiding PUR degradation campaigns and sustainable plastic recycling efforts in the future.

         <title>Organic Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Achieving 4.8&#8197;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid electrolyte with high donor number additive is introduced, presenting a new concept of organic cathode electrolyte interphase to inhibit the harmful reactions of high voltage LiCoO2. It provides reversible cathodic electrochemistry at ultra&#8208;high voltage, offering new possibilities for addressing the typical challenges faced by high&#8208;voltage cathodes in current energy storage systems.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO2 (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Constructing a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is essential to mitigate adverse reactions at high voltages. However, conventional inorganic CEIs dominated by LiF have shown limited performance for high&#8208;voltage LCO. Here, we propose an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) with a high donor number additive, enabling Li//LCO cells to achieve a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7&#8197;V/4.8&#8197;V and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.9&#8201;%/74.2&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. During this process, a groundbreaking phenomenon was discovered: the construction of a stable organic CEI rich in C&#8722;F bonds by the high donor number additive under high voltage. These strong polar C&#8722;F bonds exhibit excellent electrochemical inertness and film&#8208;forming properties, resulting in optimal passivation of the cathode. This organic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;dominated CEI significantly suppresses phase transitions, cobalt dissolution, and gas evolution in LCO at high voltage. Additionally, the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 and 4.95&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells also demonstrate outstanding cycling stability. Even at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the ILE&#8208;constructed organic CEI maintains superior performance. Our findings highlight the potential of organic CEI to enhance high&#8208;voltage cathode stability, paving the way for more efficient lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Developing high-voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium-ion batteries.

         <title>Screened d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Turing Structure of Confined Nickel for Sulfion Oxidation Accelerated Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constructed Turing structure, composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets, screens the direct d&#8208;p orbit coupling between TM and S2&#8722; and activates optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8722;, enabling exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production.







Abstract
The sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) could offer an energy&#8208;efficient and tech&#8208;economically favorable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for H2 production. Transition metal (TM) based catalysts have been considered promising candidates for SOR but suffer from limited activity due to the excessive bond strength from TM&#8208;S2&#8722; d&#8208;p orbit coupling. Herein, we propose a feasible strategy of screening direct d&#8208;p orbit hybridization between TM and S2&#8722; by constructing the Turing structure composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets. The optimized p&#8208;p orbit coupling between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8722; enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production. Specifically, it achieves a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow potential of 0.67&#8197;V vs. RHE for alkaline SOR. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron transfer from Ni imparts metallicity and a higher p&#8208;band center to carbon shells, thereby contributing to optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization and a thermodynamically favorable stepwise sulfion degradation. Practically, a two&#8208;electrode flow cell achieves an industrial current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an unprecedented low voltage of 0.91&#8197;V while maintaining stability for over 300&#8197;hours, and exhibits high productivities of 3.83 and 0.32&#8197;kg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 for sulfur and H2, respectively.

         <title>Sabatier Optimal of Mn&#8208;N4 Single Atom Catalysts for Selective Oxidative Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Sabatier relationship was realized by a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst with metal single atoms for regulating adsorption energies of two reactants in selective oxidative desulfurization. This relationship revealed reactivity descriptors of H2S&#8208;ODH for high performance in a wide range of O2 concentrations.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship of competitive adsorption between reactants is the prerequisite for high activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis, especially the difference between the adsorption energies (Eads) of two reactive intermediates in Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models. Using oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S&#8208;ODH) as a probe, we develop various metal single atoms on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;NDC) catalysts for controlling Eads&#8208;H2S, Eads&#8208;O2 and investigating the difference in activity and selectivity. Combining theoretical and experimental results, a Sabatier relationship between the catalytic performance and Eads&#8208;O2/Eads&#8208;H2S emerges. Mn&#8208;NDC as the optimal catalyst shows excellent H2S conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%) and sulfur selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%) in a wide range of O2 concentrations over 100&#8197;h. Such a high&#8208;efficiency performance is attributed to appropriate Eads&#8208;H2S and Eads&#8208;O2 on Mn&#8208;N4 sites, boosting redox cycle between Mn2+ and Mn3+, as well as preferential formation of sulfur. This work provides a fundamental guidance for designing Sabatier optimal catalysts in L&#8722;H models.

This work invented a new rechargeable battery chemistry: Li metal&#8208;hydrogen gas (Li&#8722;H), with a concept novelty based on two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8722;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode.







Abstract
The global clean energy transition and carbon neutrality call for developing high&#8208;performance batteries. Here we report a rechargeable lithium metal &#8208; catalytic hydrogen gas (Li&#8722;H) battery utilizing two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8722;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode. The universal properties of the H2 cathode enable the battery to demonstrate attractive electrochemical performance, including high theoretical specific energy up to 2825&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, discharge voltage of 3&#8197;V, round&#8208;trip efficiency of 99.7&#8201;%, reversible areal capacity of 5&#8211;20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, all&#8208;climate characteristics with a wide operational temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, and high utilization of active materials. A rechargeable anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;H battery is further constructed by plating Li metal from cost&#8208;effective lithium salts under a low catalyst loading of &lt;0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work presents a route to design batteries based on catalytic hydrogen gas cathode for high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;vacancy VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;Scheme heterostructure with optimized defect concentration was successfully constructed, displaying excellent PMS activation ability synergized with photoexcitation for degrading organic pollutants without aeration. Emphasizing the competitive interaction between O2 and PMS within the catalyst is pivotal for controlling the synergistic photoexcitation of PMS for the first time.







Abstract
The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect VO&#8722;M&#8211;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67&#8197;min&#8722;1 g&#8722;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Methionine Incorporation into Cyclophilin A by Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis for 19F NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;complete incorporation of trifluoromethyl methionine (tfmM) into Cyclophilin A (CypA) was achieved by cell&#8208;free synthesis, preserving its substrate binding affinity and enzymatic activity. Availability of the highly responsive and sensitive tfmM probe paves the way for studying protein&#8208;protein/ligand interactions and protein dynamics by 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;19 NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. Of particular interest is the exploitation of trifluoromethyl (tfm) groups, given their high sensitivity and superior transverse relaxation properties, compared to single fluorine atoms. However, biosynthetic incorporation of tfm&#8208;bearing amino acids remains challenging due to cytotoxicity and incompatibility with natural tRNA synthetases. Here, we report on overcoming this challenge using cell&#8208;free synthesis, incorporating trifluoromethyl&#8208;methionine (tfmM) into the protein Cyclophilin A (CypA) with remarkably high efficiency, impossible via biosynthetic means. Importantly, we demonstrate that tfmM CypA binds a native substrate, the N&#8208;terminal domain of HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (HIV&#8208;1 CA&#8208;NTD), and retains peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. It also binds the peptide inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) with the same affinity as non&#8208;labeled, wild&#8208;type CypA. Furthermore, we show that 19F isotope shifts and 19F solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) provide valuable structural information on surface exposure. Taken together, our study illustrates that tfmM can be readily incorporated into proteins at very high levels by cell&#8208;free synthesis without disturbing protein structure and function, significantly expanding the scope of 19F NMR spectroscopy for studying protein structure and dynamics.

         <title>Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P Metathesis: A Direct Route to Structurally Constrained, Cationic PIII Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound with the OCO dianionic pincer&#8208;type ligand [LP][SbCl4] was prepared in a single step via the Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction of the LSb&#8208;Cl with PCl3. The preliminary reactivity of [LP][SbCl4] with water, ammonia, and amines showed that the [SbCl4]&#8722; is not innocent in these reactions. Changing the [SbCl4]&#8722; to [Cb]&#8722; anion, rerouted the reactivity of the resulting [LP][Cb] with water, alcohols, ammonia, and amines to the [LP]+ cation only. In the case of PhOH and PhNH2 activation, the reactions were found to be thermoneutral.







Abstract
Structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound [LP][SbCl4] with an OCO pincer&#8208;type ligand (L) having a central carbene donor was directly synthesized via an Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction between PCl3 and LSb&#8208;Cl. [LP][SbCl4] was isolated and its reactivity with small molecules (ROH and RNH2) was studied, showing that [SbCl4]&#8722; is not an innocent counter anion, but an active participant in these reactions. When the [SbCl4]&#8722; was replaced with the [CB11H12]&#8722; ([Cb]&#8722;) anion, the reactions were redirected to [LP]+ cation only. The reactions with alcohols and amines led to the equilibrium between the products of the formal E&#8722;H (E=O, N) bond oxidative addition to the P&#8208;center and products of the P&#8208;center/ligand&#8208;assisted bond activation. Remarkably, [LP]+ activated the PhO&#8722;H and PhN(H)&#8722;H bonds in a reversible, thermoneutral fashion.

&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to [&lt;b&gt;Cb&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion, rerouted the reactivity of the resulting [&lt;b&gt;LP&lt;/b&gt;][&lt;b&gt;Cb&lt;/b&gt;] with water, alcohols, ammonia, and amines to the [&lt;b&gt;LP&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation only. In the case of PhOH and PhNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, the reactions were found to be thermoneutral.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally constrained, cationic P&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; compound [&lt;b&gt;LP&lt;/b&gt;][&lt;b&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;] with an &lt;i&gt;OCO&lt;/i&gt; pincer-type ligand (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;) having a central carbene donor was directly synthesized via an Sb-to-P metathesis reaction between PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;LSb-Cl&lt;/b&gt;. [&lt;b&gt;LP&lt;/b&gt;][&lt;b&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;] was isolated and its reactivity with small molecules (ROH and RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was studied, showing that [&lt;b&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is not an innocent counter anion, but an active participant in these reactions. When the [&lt;b&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was replaced with the [&lt;b&gt;CB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ([&lt;b&gt;Cb&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;) anion, the reactions were redirected to [&lt;b&gt;LP&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation only. The reactions with alcohols and amines led to the equilibrium between the products of the formal E&#8722;H (E=O, N) bond oxidative addition to the P-center and products of the P-center/ligand-assisted bond activation. Remarkably, [&lt;b&gt;LP&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; activated the PhO&#8722;H and PhN(H)&#8722;H bonds in a reversible, thermoneutral fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards the Use of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Sources by Direct Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High active catalysts and buffered electrolytes are suggested as a prerequisite to performing CO2 reduction at low CO2 concentrations of 2&#8201;%. The suggested strategy not only enables high CO production and favorable CO2RR metrics but also contributes to decarbonization.







Abstract
The direct CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from simulated flue gas of various CO2 concentrations could minimize extra energy for pre&#8208;concentration processes to highly concentrated CO2 as a feedstock. We investigate the challenges for CO2RR caused by low CO2 concentrations and provide strategies concerning the impact of the chosen electrocatalyst material and the selection of the electrolyte to attain high CO selectivity. We continuously feed CO2 mixed with N2 (the typical dilutant in flue gas) in various ratios to gas diffusion electrodes in a model flow&#8208;through electrolyzer. Operating the CO2RR at lower CO2 concentrations results in an overpotential shift to more cathodic values. We show that higher active catalysts can maintain high CO selectivity down to 5&#8201;% CO2 by using NiCu&#8208;based catalysts. NiCu reached its limit when the CO2 concentration was lowered to 2&#8201;%, due to low CO2 availability and competition of carbonate formation. Employing near&#8208;neutral electrolytes with buffering capacity, we maintained high Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials and higher CO2 utilization at low CO2 concentration.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Enhanced Linear and Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties of Chiral Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chiral self&#8208;assembly strategy has been demonstrated to effectively boost the linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides. Ultimately, a near&#8208;unity green light emission is achieved. These chiral samples not only feature intense circularly polarized luminescence (glum~4.2&#215;10&#8722;2), but also showcase a strengthened capability to discriminate circularly polarized laser (gSHG&#8208;CD~1.8) that ranks among the highest reported values.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) hold great promise in broad applications ranging from ferroelectrics, spintronics to nonlinear optics, owing to their broken inversion symmetry and tunable chiroptoelectronic properties. Typically, chiral HOMHs are constructed by chiral organic cations and metal anion polyhedra, with the latter regarded as optoelectronic active units. However, the primary design approaches are largely constrained to regulation of general components within structural formula. Herein, supramolecular approaches have been taken for the functionalization of chiral enantiomers by anchoring chiral cations with crown ether hosting molecules. Chiral HOMHs of R&#8208;/S&#8208;(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6@ClMBA)2MnBr4 have been thus obtained with boosted linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. The self&#8208;assembled cations lead to enhanced structural rigidity, which promote near&#8208;unity green light emission and strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high asymmetry factor, along with high efficiency second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses. In particular, these chiral HOMH single crystals demonstrate a sensitive discrimination for circularly polarized laser in the near&#8208;infrared region with the nonlinear optical asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) as high as 1.8. This work highlights the contribution of supramolecular assembly in improving chiroptical performances, offering valuable insights for the design of new chiral HOMH materials with promising application potentials as linear and nonlinear CPL emitters and detectors.

         <dc:description>
Chiral Re(I) emitters exhibiting strong circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with enhanced dissymmetry factors and PLQYs are tailored and exploited to develop the the first examples of rhenium&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. The latter exhibit gEL factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 along with a good device performance. This work highlights potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CP&#8208;OLED applications, and provides a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active emitters.







Abstract
Chiral rhenium(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) are an attractive mainstay for CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, the efficiency of such emitters is not ideal, and they have never been explored for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) applications. Here, we have tailored robust chiral Re(I) complexes with improved CPP properties, and demonstrated CPEL from rhenium emitters for the first time. Two pairs of enantiomeric Re(I) complexes have been synthesized by introducing of one or two chiral menthol groups into 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit (phen) of archetypical emitters [ReBr(CO)3(phen)]. The designed complexes exhibit a yellow CPP with enhanced |glum| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |gEL| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 and a maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active Re(I) complexes.

&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)-based CP-OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP-active Re(I) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ce3+/Ce4+ Ion Redox Shuttle Stabilized Cu&#948;+ for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a simple solvothermal strategy to obtain Ce/CuOx catalyst for the CO2 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products, which exhibits high C2 selectivity (at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, 40&#8201;% for C2H4, 6&#8201;% for CH3COOH and 14&#8201;% for CH3CH2OH) and durability over 25&#8197;h. The excellent performance of Ce/CuOx may be attributed to the following factors: 1)&#8197;The dispersed Ce stabilizes Cu&#948;+ species under the reduction condition. 2)&#8197;The presence of Cu&#948;+ reduces the free energy of forming *COCO intermediate and decreases the energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling reaction, resulting in the high activity and selectivity of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4.







Abstract
The CO2 electroreduction reaction has advantages in clean and pollution&#8208;free carbon conversion, but it still faces challenges in carbon utilization efficiency and improving the selectivity of C2 products. Although the dynamic Cu&#948;+ state is known to favor the C&#8722;C coupling process, the suitable Cu&#948;+ species for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 are difficult to maintain under the conditions of strong reduction and large current. Herein, we propose a Ce doping strategy to stabilize the Cu&#948;+ state (Ce/CuOx) during the CO2RR process, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products (40&#8201;% for C2H4, 14&#8201;% for CH3CH2OH, and 6&#8201;% for CH3COOH), and 25&#8197;h stability at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In&#8197;situ infrared spectroscopy, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu&#948;+ is stabilized by the redox ion pairs of Ce, which reduces the energy barrier of *CO coupling, and improves the Faraday efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction of C2H4. This work provides a new idea to make full use of lanthanide variable value metals for advanced catalysis and clean energy conversion.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Piezoelectric Covalent Triazine&#8208;based Nanotube for Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Water and Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully conjugated covalent triazine&#8208;based hollow nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) with rich active sites and high surface areas has been prepared for piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution. Benefiting from piezoelectric response and fully conjugated framework, CTN&#8208;1 facilitated piezoelectric carrier separation, leading to highly efficient H2O2 production with a rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is superior to other piezoelectric materials.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non&#8208;piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine&#8208;based nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) as a novel piezoelectric material. The CTN&#8208;1 comprises of high surface area, nitrogen&#8208;rich and fully conjugated structure, which provides a series of merits for piezoelectric catalytic processes. These structural features combined with one&#8208;dimensional tubular morphology endow CTN&#8208;1 with excellent mechanical stimuli response and thus displaying prominent piezoelectric properties via pronounced nanocurvature effect. We further show that the CTN&#8208;1 enables the efficient synthesis of H2O2 from water in the air via mechanical energy conversion, with an excellent piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which exceeds other reported piezoelectric materials. The piezocatalysis by the CTN&#8208;1 can be practically integrated into a self&#8208;Fenton system, which exhibits excellent pollutant degradation capability. This work demonstrates the enormous potential of a new type of piezoelectric synthetic nanotube from organic frameworks for the in situ synthesis valuable chemicals.

         <title>Reversible and Ultrasensitive Detection of Nitric Oxide Using a Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework, copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2), has been obtained through strategic synthetic modification. The Cu3(HIB)2 device shows ultrasensitive, highly selective, reversible, and low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide. Mechanistic investigation reveals the contribution of Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) functionality of Cu3(HIB)2) for highly sensitive and reversible NO binding sites.







Abstract
This paper describes the use of a highly crystalline conductive 2D copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2) as an ultrasensitive (limit of detection of 1.8 part&#8208;per&#8208;billion), highly selective, reversible, and low power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide (NO) at room temperature. The Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;based sensors retain their sensing performance in the presence of humidity, and exhibit strong signal enhancement towards NO over other highly toxic reactive gases, such as NO2, H2S, SO2, NH3, CO, as well as CO2. Mechanistic investigations of the Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;NO interaction through spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory revealed that the Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) moieties serve as the binding sites for NO sensing, while the Ni&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) MOF analog shows no noticeable response to NO. Overall, these findings provide a significant advance in the development of crystalline metal&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid)&#8208;based conductive 2D MOFs as highly sensitive, selective, and reversible sensing materials for the low&#8208;power detection of toxic gases.

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangement of Azo Compounds Enables Low&#8208;Potential, High&#8208;capacity Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal rearrangement strategy is used to optimize the planarity and aromaticity of conventional azo compounds. Benefitted from the fused&#8208;ring structure and inherent basicity, the novel azo compounds exhibit low potential, intrinsic insolubility, and high capacity, serving as promising anode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries.







Abstract
The widespread adoption of rechargeable alkaline batteries is plagued by the performance&#8208;limiting metal anodes, which are prone to (electro)chemical corrosion and raise environmental or economic concerns. Organic redox&#8208;active materials offer a potential solution, but they typically struggle with dissolution&#8208;induced degradation and insufficiently negative reduction potentials. Herein, we introduce benzo[c]cinnoline and its derivatives (collectively referred to as BCCs), a class of aromatic azo compounds with fused&#8208;ring structure, as promising organic anode materials. BCCs exhibit pronounced aromaticity and Br&#248;nsted basicity, conferring low reduction potentials and intrinsic insolubility in alkaline solutions. Paired with the industrially established nickel hydroxide cathode, these batteries deliver excellent capacity (297&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1anode), high output voltage of 1.3&#8197;V, and extended cycle life (&#8776;16000 cycles). Notably, they also operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures down to &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C with an 8&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. We further explore the feasibility for all&#8208;organic alkaline batteries by paring BCCs with the dihydro form of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azopyridine, utilizing azo compounds for both anode and cathodes. This chemistry harnesses the unique properties of small organic molecules to enable all&#8208;organic batteries with high capacity of 236&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8211;1, fast charging at 1200&#8197;C, and easy recyclability.

&lt;p&gt;A skeletal rearrangement strategy is used to optimize the planarity and aromaticity of conventional azo compounds. Benefitted from the fused-ring structure and inherent basicity, the novel azo compounds exhibit low potential, intrinsic insolubility, and high capacity, serving as promising anode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries.

         <title>Vacuum&#8208;Assisted Confined Growth of MOF@COF Composite Membranes with Enhanced Hydrogen Permselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined growth of MOF into COF pores to prepare MOF@COF composite not only reduces the pore size of the COF membrane, but also forms a well&#8208;defined 1D nanoscale transport channel for gas permeation, thus significantly enhancing the molecular sieving property of the COF membrane for hydrogen separation. This synthesis strategy has been demonstrated with the formation of highly hydrogen permselective ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF and ZIF&#8208;67@TB&#8208;COF membranes.







Abstract
With ordered and periodic network structures, adjustable pore sizes and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have drawn much attention for the fabrication of superior separation membranes. However, it is challenging to prepare COF membranes with a molecular sieving property for gas separation due to their relatively large pore size. In this work, we develop the MOF&#8208;in&#8208;COF concept for vacuum&#8208;assisted synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF&#8208;8 inside the pores of TB&#8208;COF formed from trihydroxy&#8208;benzene&#8208;tricarbaldehyde (T) and diamino&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;disulfonic acid (B), thus constructing a novel ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF membrane. Attributing to the formation of a well&#8208;defined one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanoscale transport channel, the ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF membrane displays a high hydrogen permselectivity. At 100&#8201;&#176;C and 200&#8197;kPa, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2, H2/CH4 and H2/C3H8 are 21.9, 63.1 and 134.4, respectively, which are much higher than those of the pristine TB&#8208;COF membrane due to the precise size sieving channels brought about by the incorporated MOF. The synthesis of ZIF&#8208;67@TB&#8208;COF membrane demonstrates the versatility of the synthesis strategy.

         <title>Single Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Quantum Dots for Multicolor, Bright and Efficient Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and universal strategy for producing efficient solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with a distinctive non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance has been developed. Using this new type of single solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, bright, multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with tunable emission peaks ranging from 535 to 640&#8197;nm have been successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as a key technology for next&#8208;generation full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting. However, achieving broad color tunability in LEDs that utilize a single QD emissive material continues to pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first example of bright, multicolor electroluminescent LEDs with tunable emission peaks spanning from 535 to 640&#8197;nm, utilizing a new type of single red solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (R&#8208;SSCQDs). Unlike conventional CQDs, which often exhibit weak or negligible emission in solid&#8208;state form, R&#8208;SSCQDs demonstrate bright red emission in solid state and green emission in diluted state. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance of R&#8208;SSCQDs effectively suppress &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission. By adjusting the weight ratios of R&#8208;SSCQDs doped in host materials, we showcase bright, efficient and multicolor CQD&#8208;based LEDs that emit green, yellow, orange, and red light, achieving a record&#8208;high luminance of 15,834&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and current efficiency of 10.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1. This work presents a straightforward and universal strategy for creating efficient solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, showcasing significant potential for color&#8208;tunable LED applications.

         <dc:description>
A series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfers were accomplished at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. This strategy provides a convenient entry to access a variety of uranium(IV)&#8722;element multiple bonds. Moreover, these results highlight the unique ability of the tris(amido)arene ligand framework in stabilizing reactive intermediates and unusual structural motifs for metal complexes.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry of uranium(II) compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report a series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfer reactions at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. The reactions of uranium(II) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)U] (M=K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand) and K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)) with pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide or nitrosobenzene, elemental sulfur/selenium or triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide, and ditellurium salt led to the isolation of uranium(IV) terminal oxo and chalcogenido complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UX] (X=O, S, Se, Te). In addition, the reactions of [M][(AdTPBN3)U] with aryl azides ArN3 or diazoalkanes R2CN2 quantitatively yielded uranium(IV) terminal imido [M][(AdTPBN3)UNAr] or hydrazonido(2&#8722;) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UN2CR2], respectively. Notably, the low&#8208;temperature reaction between [M][(AdTPBN3)U] and mesityl azide allowed the isolation of the first uranium(IV) aryldiazenylimido complex as an intermediate. These uranium(IV)&#8722;element multiply bound compounds were fully characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, solution and solid&#8208;state magnetometry, and elemental analysis. The controlled two&#8208;electron oxidative reactions at a uranium(II) center not only expand the redox reactivity of uranium(II) but also offer a convenient new route to access uranium&#8722;element multiply bound compounds.

         <title>Stabilizing SPAN in Non&#8208;Flammable Acetonitrile Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Graphite||SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a nonflammable acetonitrile (AN)&#8208;based electrolyte for safe SPAN batteries for the first time. We first identified the irreversible cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds of SPAN as the main reason for the failure of SPAN in conventional AN electrolyte. We further demonstrated fluoroethylene carbonate additive could avoid the structure deterioration of SPAN in conventional AN electrolyte by inhibiting the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds, suppressing the transformation from SPAN to elemental sulfur, and forming uniform solid electrolyte interface on the surface of SPAN. With the newly&#8208;formulated electrolyte, excellent cycling stability and high safety are obtained in both Li||SPAN and Gr||SPAN cells. The present exploitation broadens the electrolyte choices for SPAN cathodes and promises the practical applications of SPAN batteries.







Abstract
Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) presents an opportunity to replace elemental sulfur as a &#8220;shuttle&#8208;free&#8221; cathode for secondary Li&#8722;S batteries, which can be an ideal choice for stationary energy storage due to its abundance, low cost, and sustainability. The electrolyte options for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SPAN batteries have been limited to the flammable carbonate and ether ones, which raises safety concerns. Here, we explored the use of a non&#8208;flammable acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte for SPAN battery for the first time and identified the irreversible cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds of SPAN as the main reason for the failure of SPAN in AN electrolyte. Fortunately, by introducing 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% fluoroethylene carbonate into the AN electrolyte, the bond cleavage in SPAN is suppressed and a stable cathode electrolyte interface is formed, both contributing to stabilizing the structure of SPAN during electrochemical process. Consequently, we achieved a stable cycling for 900&#8197;cycles in Li||SPAN cells. Moreover, by pairing with a pre&#8208;lithiated graphite (pGr) anode, the newly formulated electrolyte enables extended cycle life for 1500&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 91&#8201;% and superb safety in pGr||SPAN full cell. The present exploitation broadens the electrolyte choices of SPAN&#8208;based batteries and paves the way for future applications for these batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Properties of Highly Fluorinated Oligonucleotide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective strategy for developing highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles functionalized with one or more branched, highly fluorinated residues. Fluorination is used as a tool to drive nucleic acid self&#8208;assembly and fine&#8208;tune the interactions of the resulting spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with proteins, as well as their gene&#8208;silencing properties. This allows the development of fluorinated SNAs as efficient delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, used as therapeutics to silence disease&#8208;related genes, offer significant advantages over small molecule drugs: they provide high specificity, the ability to target &#8220;undruggable&#8221; molecules, and adaptability to a wide range of disease phenotypes. However, their instability in biological media, as well their rapid clearance from the organism limit their applicability, necessitating the use of nanocarriers to overcome these challenges. Among these strategies, spherical nucleic acids (SNA)&#8212;composed of a densely packed corona of oligonucleotides around a nanoparticle&#8212;have emerged as a powerful tool, in particular when self&#8208;assembled from DNA amphiphiles. This non&#8208;covalent strategy however has caveats, especially when it comes to stability in complex biological media, where these SNAs disassemble in contact to serum proteins. Here, we developed highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles that readily self&#8208;assemble into SNAs and have tunable stability profiles in biological media. They are made of branched fluorinated moieties with potentially improved biodegradability as compared to their linear counterparts. Depending on the number of fluorophilic interactions, the self&#8208;assembled SNAs can have excellent serum stabilities&#8212;up to days&#8212;and readily deliver nucleic acid therapeutics for gene silencing applications. These systems show great potential as promising candidates for nucleic acid&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Hydrogen Radical Enabling Industrial&#8208;Level Oxygen Electroreduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enhanced two&#8208;electron ORR performance was achieved by a rationally designed system incorporating cobalt (II) clusters onto oxidized carbon nanotube composites. This enhancement is attributed to the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites and high local proton availability, and enables effective conversion of ethylene glycol to oxalic acid by coupling with an electro&#8208;Fenton process.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and water, powered by renewable electricity, provides a highly attractive alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive autoxidation process presently used in industry, but much remains unknown about this two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR), especially the local proton effect. Here, we have investigated the function of hydrogen&#8208;associated intermediates in the 2e&#8208;ORR using a rationally designed cooperative electrode material with cobalt (II) clusters embedded onto the oxidized carbon nanotube composites (Co&#8208;OCNT). We found that the local proton availability can determine both the reaction kinetics and selectivity. A 2e&#8208;ORR process involving hydrogen radical transfer is confirmed. Specifically, the carbon sites from the OCNTs promote proton production, and the cobalt sites from the Co cluster facilitate ORR intermediate formation. The high local proton availability and the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites both contribute to the superior reaction kinetics and selectivity of the Co&#8208;OCNT, reaching an H2O2 production rate of ~40.6&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 90&#8201;% at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Further cascading the 2e&#8208;ORR with the electro&#8208;Fenton process shows a high selectivity of oxalic acid up to 97&#8201;% for the valorization of ethylene glycol.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared to Blue Photon Upconversion by Ultrafast Spin Flip and Triplet Energy Transfer at Organic/2D Semiconductor Interface</title>

A 2D organic/inorganic bilayer heterostructure with atomically thin monolayer semiconductor and 9,10&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)anthracene exhibits efficient and low threshold NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue light upconversion, dirven by ultrafast spin flip, interfacial exciton transfer and triplet&#8208;triple annihilation. This work demonstrates 2D monolayers as superior sensitizers for photon upconversion and reveals the fundamental photoexcitation dynamics.







Abstract
Solid state photon upconversion by triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion, holds instant promise for enhancing optoelectronic and photochemical applications. Despite extensive studies, NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion has remained particularly challenging and elusive due to inherent multiple energy&#8208;downhill processes in TTA upconversion. In this study, using atomically thin two dimensional (2D) monolayer semiconductor as a triplet sensitizer, we demonstrate an efficient and robust solid&#8208;state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion system. The ultrathin and flexible organic/2D bilayer heterostructure exhibits a NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion with high quantum yield (&#934;UC=1.2&#8201;%, out of 50&#8201;%), low threshold power density (Ith=110&#8197;mW/cm2) and a record&#8208;high apparent anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.12&#8197;eV. Further spin&#8208; and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast (&lt;500&#8197;fs) electron spin flip to triplet&#8208;like excitons in semiconductor sensitizer and subsequent picosecond (~6&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) interfacial Dexter energy transfer to annihilator molecules. The triplet energy transfer rate and efficiency depend strongly on driving force, exhibiting Marcus normal region behavior. This work demonstrates 2D monolayer semiconductor as a superior ultrathin light harvesting and triplet sensitization layer and reveals the key knob to overcome the compromise between upconversion efficiency and energy loss, offering a viable pathway to efficient solid state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion and implementation.

         <title>Unusual Endotaxy Growth of Hexagonal Nanosheets by the Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline azobenzene containing homopolymer (PAzoPMA) to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic PAzoPMA is first annealed in isopropanol to form a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets.







Abstract
A classical crystallization usually grows epitaxially from a crystal nucleus. Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline homopolymer to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic homopolymer, poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;(phenyldiazenyl)phenoxy)propyl methacrylate) (PAzoPMA), is first annealed in isopropanol to afford a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets. The energy fluctuation by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation during self&#8208;assembly confirms the packing state of PAzoPMA chains in different solvents. In isopropanol, the total energy is the lowest, demonstrating the tight regular arrangement of polymer chains. In addition, the non&#8208;bonding interaction energy is also the lowest, leading to the favorable contact with solvent molecules and the formation of hexagonal nanosheets. Otherwise, nanowires and giant large compound micelles are formed in ethanol and n&#8208;butanol, respectively. Overall, an unusual endotaxy crystallization manner of an amphiphilic homopolymer is observed during the preparation of hexagonal nanosheets, which brings fresh insight for understanding the crystallization behavior of polymers and preparing functional soft nanomaterials.

         <title>Regularly Arranged Heterogeneous Pores in Gas Separation Membranes Constructed by Cocrystallization of Porous Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating heterogeneous pore membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. The co&#8208;crystal membranes, featuring alternating small pore&#8208;large pore structure, exhibited good H2/CO2 gas separation performance by overcoming the selectivity&#8208;permeability trade&#8208;off.







Abstract
Integrating two or more materials to construct membranes with heterogeneous pore structures is an effective strategy for enhancing separation performance. Regularly arranging these heterogeneous pores can significantly optimize the combined effect of the introduced components. Porous Organic Cages (POCs), an emerging subclass of porous materials composed of discrete molecules, assemble to form interconnected pores and exhibit permanent porosity in the solid state. A unique feature of POCs is their modularity, enabling a &#8220;mix and match&#8221; approach to create co&#8208;crystal structures driven by the intermolecular interactions. Herein, we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating gas separation membranes. We prepared membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. By optimizing the cocrystalization conditions, we successfully fabricated continuous, defect&#8208;free gas membranes, benefiting from chiral recognition interactions. By introducing regularly alternating small and large pores, we addressed challenges such as the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in gas separation membrane. Moreover, the cocrystallization strategy has been proven effective for other molecular systems besides POCs, such as macrocycles, for the preparation of co&#8208;crystal membranes. This method broadens the scope for fabricating high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes with ordered heterogeneous pores.

         <title>Hollow Pt&#8208;Encrusted RuCu Nanocages Optimizing OH Adsorption for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nanocages with Pt epitaxy grown on RuCu have been successfully synthesized as efficient electrocatalysts via a galvanic replacement strategy, exploiting the distinct electrochemical potentials of Pt, Ru, and Cu. The optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs/C catalysts not only exhibite exceptional HOR performance, but achieve a significantly higher specific peak power density (15.9&#8197;W&#8201;mgPt+Ru&#8722;1) under fuel cell conditions, making them a promising high&#8208;efficiency anode nanocatalyst for practical AEMFC applications.







Abstract
As one of the best candidates for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), ruthenium (Ru) has attracted significant attention for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), although it suffers from sluggish kinetics under alkaline conditions due to its strong hydroxide affinity. In this work, we develop ternary hollow nanocages with Pt epitaxy on RuCu (Pt&#8208;RuCu NCs) as efficient HOR catalysts for application in AEMFCs. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the synergy in optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs significantly modifies the electronic structure and coordination environment of Ru, thereby balancing the binding strengths of H* and OH* species, which leads to a markedly enhanced HOR performance. Specifically, the optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs/C achieves a mass activity of 5.91&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ru&#8722;1, which is ~3.3, ~2.2, and ~15.0 times higher than that of RuCu NCs/C (1.38&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1), PtRu/C (1.83&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ru&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.37&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1), respectively. Impressively, the specific peak power density of fuel cells reaches 15.9&#8197;W mgPt+Ru&#8722;1, significantly higher than those of most reported PtRu&#8208;based fuel cells.

         <title>Alkene Epoxidation with Water by Confined Active Co Sites on BiVO4 Photoanodes under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin cobalt molecule with a closed Co site was loaded onto a BiVO4 photoanode to drive the epoxidation of olefins. The selectivity and conversion of the product exceeded the results of other photoanode studies. It can also be synthesized on a gram scale at room temperature. Multiple characterizations confirm that the Co species reacts with H2O to form Co&#8722;O* intermediates, thereby facilitating the epoxidation reaction via a one&#8208;electron process.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis systems have recently seen significant growth in organic transformations, but are limited by the inherent physicochemical properties of electrode materials. To enhance selectivity in these processes, we propose an innovative advancement in the rational design of photoanodes. Specifically, we incorporated cobalt porphyrin co&#8208;catalysts with confined Co sites onto bismuth vanadate films as a photoanode. This photoanode significantly enhances the efficacy of styrene epoxidation, achieving selectivity and conversion rates of 90&#8201;% and 99&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the reaction utilizes water as the sole oxygen source, operates at room temperature, and is easily scalable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The developed photoanode demonstrates robust performance across various alkene substrates. Operando characterizations reveal that during the epoxidation reaction, the confined Co sites within the porphyrin structure catalyze the oxidation of H2O to form Co&#8722;O*, serving as critical intermediates that facilitate cyclization reactions via one&#8208;electron processes. This study introduces an innovative heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis strategy with customizable active sites tailored for selective catalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Masked Divalent Reactivity of Heterobimetallic Lanthanide Isocarbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mildly reducing organo&#8208;iron ligand allows trivalent yttrium and dysprosium to react as though they were present in their less common divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is used to reduce a series of N&#8208;heterocycles, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; or trimetallic lanthanide complexes of the reduced ligands.

&lt;p&gt;Using a mildly reducing organo-iron ligand allows trivalent yttrium and dysprosium to react as though they were present in their less common divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is used to reduce a series of N-heterocycles, resulting in the formation of mono-, di- or trimetallic lanthanide complexes of the reduced ligands.

         <title>Dynamic Co&#8208;Clustering and Self&#8208;Sorting in Interactive Protocell Populations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temporal control over co&#8208;clustering and self&#8208;sorting in binary populations of hairy protocells comprising chitosan (red)&#8208; or alginate (green)&#8208;functionalized membranes is achieved by endogenous enzyme&#8208;mediated decreases in pH. Reorganization of the protocell community mitigates signal attenuation in an inter&#8208;protocellular cascade reaction (A+B&#8594;C) when undertaken with a deactivating agent (D).







Abstract
The design and implementation of collective actions in model protocell communities is an on&#8208;going challenge in synthetic protobiology. Herein, we covalently graft alginate or chitosan onto the outer surface of semipermeable enzyme&#8208;containing silica colloidosomes to produce hairy catalytic protocells with pH&#8208;switchable membrane surface charge. Binary populations of the enzymatically active protocells exhibit self&#8208;initiated stimulus&#8208;responsive changes in spatial organization such that the mixed community undergoes alternative modes of electrostatically induced self&#8208;sorting and reversible co&#8208;clustering. We demonstrate that co&#8208;clustering, but not self&#8208;sorting, mitigates signal attenuation in a binary community of enzyme&#8208;containing sender and receiver protocells due to increased proximity effects. The level of signal attenuation is correlated with a time&#8208;dependent pH&#8208;mediated switch in the spatial organization of the sender and receiver populations. Our results pave the way towards the development of programmable networks of adaptive life&#8208;like objects and could have implications for the development of interactive cytomimetic materials and agent&#8208;based robotics.

         <title>Versatile Strategy for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Branched Human Milk Oligosaccharides Containing the Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;Biose Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal core saccharide was prepared on a hundred&#8208;milligram scale by glycosyltransferases and amino protecting group (APG) conversions. This core saccharide was further extended into branched precursors with specific APGs, enabling controlled glycosylations, which allowed the facile synthesis of diversified branched human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Glycan microarray analysis showed that these HMOs, featuring a type&#8197;1 glycan, specifically bound to certain lectins.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exhibit prebiotic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties and confer significant benefits to infants. Branched HMOs are constructed through diverse glycosidic linkages and prominently feature the lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB, Gal&#8208;&#946;1,3&#8208;GlcNAc) motif with fucose and/or sialic acid modifications, displaying structural complexity that surpasses that of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycans. However, synthesizing comprehensive libraries of branched HMO is challenging due to this complexity. Although a few systematic synthetic strategies have emerged, many of them rely on labor&#8208;intensive chemical methodologies or exploit the substrate specificity of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (hGCNT2). In this study, we capitalized on the substrate promiscuities of hGCNT2 and bacterial glycosyltransferases (GTs) to construct a universal tetrasaccharide core in a highly efficient manner. This core was systematically and flexibly extended to generate diverse branched HMOs utilizing the promiscuity of bacterial GTs coupled with N&#8208;trifluoroacetyl glucosamine (GlcNTFA), which facilitated sugar chain elongation. The GlcNTFA residues were subsequently converted into various N&#8208;modified glucosamines through straightforward chemical manipulations to modulate the activities of additional GTs during glycan extension. These masked amino groups were ultimately reverted to N&#8208;acetyl groups, facilitating the synthesis of a broad range of asymmetric and multiantennary HMOs featuring LNB moieties, including many previously inaccessible structures.

         <title>O&#8722;O Radical Coupling in Ultrathin Reconstructed Co6.8Se8 Nanosheets for Effective Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we synthesized ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM).







Abstract
Designing ultrathin transition metal electrocatalysts with optimal surface chemistry state is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished. Herein, we synthesize ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets (NSs) with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium (Se) into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). The prepared ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit an overpotential of 253&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2, outperforming the mostly reported Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Advanced operando synchrotron spectroscopies and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs, whose surface is reconstructed into Se&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 during the OER process, could trigger direct O*&#8722;O* radical coupling rather than OOH* intermediates within AEM pathway thus lowering the energy input. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Co6.8Se8 NSs with shorter Co&#8722;Co bond length and stable Co&#8722;Se bond could optimize the rate&#8208;determining step barrier via OPM pathway. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit excellent stability for more than 500&#8197;h of continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 4&#8197;mA/cm2. The present study highlights the structural&#8208;dependent switch of OER pathways and provides valuable insights for further development of ultrathin OER catalysts.

Metabolic acidity and H2O2 dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive smart probe for image&#8208;guided primary and metastasis breast tumor resection and its clinical application.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) is crucial for accurate tumor diagnosis, offering superior resolution and penetration capabilities. Current NIR&#8208;II probes are limited by either being &#8220;always on&#8221; or responding to one stimulus, leading to low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and potential false positives. We introduced a dual&#8208;lock&#8208;controlled probe, HN&#8208;PBA, activated by both H2O2 and tumor acidic environment. This dual response ensures bright fluorescence at tumor sites, leading to higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue ratios (T/NT) compared to conventional &#8220;always on&#8221; probes and probes activated only by H2O2. This strategy allows precise tumor identification and removal of primary and metastatic tumors, achieving superior T/NT ratios (24.3/6.4 for orthotopic and lung metastasis, respectively). Our probe also effectively detected lung metastatic foci as small as&#8804;0.7&#8197;mm and showed the capability for accurate lesion localization in clinical breast cancer specimens. This dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy could aid future diagnostic probe design.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 on Z&#8208;Schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Z&#8208;schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 catalyst is efficient for urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction. It has dual active sites for adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 and the accelerated kinetics for C&#8722;N coupling reaction. The energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is reduced on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4.







Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2 is a sustainable method for urea synthesis under mild conditions. However, high&#8208;yield synthesis of urea is a challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. Herein, we have successfully engineered a Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, for boosting photocatalytic urea synthesis via enhancing the initial CO2 and N2 adsorption step and reducing the energy barrier for the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. A high urea yield of 8054.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, which was significantly higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, with accelerated charge transfer by FeS, not only had dual active sites for the chemical adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2, but also retained the high conduction band (&#8722;1.50&#8197;eV) and accelerated supply of electrons and protons, which are responsible for its good photoreduction activity and significantly reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of C&#8722;N coupling reaction.

         <title>Weakly Solvating Cyclic Ether&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolytes for Stable High&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported a deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) based on a weakly solvating solvent which is constructed by the anion effect. Due to the effective anchoring of the free solvents and the improvement of the solvation structure, the DEE is compatible with both lithium metal anode and transition metal oxide cathode (e.g. LiMn2O4) over a wide temperature range.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEE) have emerged as an innovative approach to address the instability and safety issues of lithium metal batteries at elevated temperatures. However, in practice, there is often an undesirable incompatibility between the eutectic mixture and electrodes, and also an insufficient reduction stability of DEE due to the increased Li+ concentration. Herein, we designed a new DEE by utilizing weakly solvating tetrahydropyran (THP) solvent. Due to the high reduction resistance of THP and concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), this DEE demonstrates enhanced compatibility with Li metal anode and high temperature tolerance with LiMn2O4 cathode. The Li||LiMn2O4 cell (1.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) shows a high capacity retention of 96.02&#8201;% after 600 cycles at room temperature. More importantly, this Li||LiMn2O4 cell achieves a remarkable high&#8208;temperature performance with a high capacity retention of 91.72&#8201;% after 120 cycles and low self&#8208;discharge after storage for 240&#8197;hours at a high temperature of 55&#8201;&#176;C, which is critical for LiMn2O4 cathode. Overall, this electrolyte design provides an alternative pathway for the development of DEEs for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries, which can also be expanded to other batteries.

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side chain phenyl positional isomerization induces strong intermolecular spatial conjugation, simultaneously improving the fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties of phototheranostic agents in the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained o&#8208;ITNP NPs excels in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy.







Abstract
The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.

Cordycicadins A&#8722;D are C20 polyketides, all containing a &#947;&#8208;lactone fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthesis for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unisolated. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products.







Abstract
Cordycicadins A&#8722;D are four C20 polyketides, all containing a &#947;&#8208;lactone fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unknown. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B. The targets were convergently assembled, in a biomimetic fashion, via an efficient ketene trapping&#8208;intramolecular Michael addition sequence that delivered the requisite 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;fused framework with high diastereoselectivity, enabled by the synthesis of complex dioxenones that serve as in situ ketene precursors. Recognition of the embedded polyketide symmetry enabled the use of a divergent&#8208;convergent synthetic strategy, based on the use of two products from an early&#8208;stage enzymatic resolution. The synthetic routes afforded (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D in 14 steps and 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B in 13 steps (longest linear sequence). This work confirms the structure of (&#8722;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the observed instability of the anticipated natural product 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadin B during purification may explain why it is yet to be isolated.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Microwire Heterojunctions with Flexible Optical Waveguide and Hydration&#8208;Mediated Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy has been used for the in situ generation of flexible heterojunctions that display ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguides, high flexibility and controllable emission sequences. This integration of the benefits of flexibility and heterojunctions approach offers the possibility for developing photonic information encryption systems.







Abstract
Flexible heterojunctions based on molecular systems are in high demand for applications in photonics, electronics, and smart materials, but fabrication challenges have hindered progress. Herein, we present an in situ approach to creating optical heterojunctions using hydration&#8208;mediated flexible molecular crystals. These hydrated multi&#8208;component molecular solids display strong blue emitting optical waveguides with minimal optical loss (0.005 dB/&#956;m) and excellent flexibility (elastic modulus: 3.87&#8197;GPa). The water&#8208;mediated process enables the molecular microwires with tunable elastic and plastic deformation, as well as reversible uptake and release of lattice water, facilitating the formation of flexible heterojunctions. Spectral analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that these microwires exhibit both photochromism and color&#8208;tunable dual emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence), expanding their utility in photonic information encoding. Therefore, this work introduces a hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy for fabricating crystalline heterojunctions with on&#8208;demand processability and controllable emission sequences, enabling optical signal manipulation at the micro/nanoscale.

         <title>Tailored Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Nanozymes for Enhanced Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

This work developed a novel metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based nanozyme that effectively blocks bacterial energy metabolism pathways through finely tuned catalytic center and substrate channel structures, demonstrating excellent antimicrobial properties and the potential to promote infected wound healing.







Abstract
The global crisis of bacterial infections is exacerbated by the escalating threat of microbial antibiotic resistance. Nanozymes promise to provide ingenious solutions. Here, we reported a homogeneous catalytic structure of Pt nanoclusters with finely tuned metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) channel structures for the treatment of infected wounds. Catalytic site normalization showed that the active site of the Pt aggregates structure with fine&#8208;tuned pore modifications structure had a catalytic capacity of 14.903&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1, which was 18.7&#8197;times higher than that of the Pt particles in monodisperse state in ZIF&#8208;8 (0.793&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1). In situ tests revealed that the change from homocleavage to heterocleavage of hydrogen peroxide at the interface of the nanozyme was one of the key reasons for the improvement of nanozyme activity. Density&#8208;functional theory and kinetic simulations of the reaction interface jointly determine the role of the catalytic center and the substrate channel together. Metabolomics analysis showed that the developed nanozyme, working in conjunction with reactive oxygen species, could effectively block energy metabolic pathways within bacteria, leading to spontaneous apoptosis and bacterial rupture. This pioneering study elucidates new ideas for the regulation of artificial enzyme activity and provides new perspectives for the development of efficient antibiotic substitutes.

The cover picture illustrates a water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt that can be synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of methylene&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]MCPP). Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics, which are likely derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure. Details of the study are reported by Akiko Yagi, Kazuma Amaike, Kenichiro Itami et al. in their Communication (e202414645).

The intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and water are illustrated in the cover picture. While water and OH form hydrogen bonds, this does not fully capture the interaction. Electrons can delocalize across adjacent adsorbates, leading to a more complex electronic structure than anticipated. The cover displays the dilemma of a hydrogen atom situated between two oxygen atoms, as is the case with adjacent OH and water. Which oxygen atom will hydrogen form a bond with? The answer is both, as detailed by Jan Rossmeisl et al. in their Communication (e202417308).

Spatiotemporally controlled orthogonal regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation has been achieved in the Research Article (e202417916) by Xiangfei Li, Fangzhi Yu and Lele Li. In the approach, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation, while light&#8208;induced fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation, thereby achieving orthogonal control over the immune regulation.

Polymers with intrinsic microporosity have been pioneered by Huaqiang Zeng et al. in their Research Article (e202418304) as a compelling platform for constructing artificial lithium ion channels. These Li+ channels achieve exceptionally high Li+ transport rates coupled with exceptional selectivity. Remarkably, their transport properties can be precisely tuned by adjusting the synthesis temperature, presenting a versatile strategy for optimizing performance.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors: Molecular Design Strategies, Applications and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the latest progress in conjugated polymers (CPs) for high&#8208;performance organic electro&#8208;chemical transistors (OECTs) via trying to extract the molecular design strategies, briefly presenting the applications of CP&#8208;based OECTs, and giving perspectives in this field.







Abstract
The last decade has witnessed significant progress in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their enormous potential applications in various bioelectronic devices, such as artificial synapses, biological interfaces, and biosensors. The remarkable advance in this field is highly powered by the development of novel organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs). &#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers (CPs), which are widely used in various optoelectronics, are emerging as key channel materials for OECTs. In this review, after briefly introducing OECT, we then mainly focus on the latest progress in CPs for high&#8208;performance OECTs. The correlations of their structure, basic physicochemical properties, and device performance are elucidated by evaluating their electronic characters, optoelectronic properties, and OECT performance. Then, the applications of CP&#8208;based OECTs are briefly presented. Finally, we discuss several remaining issues or challenges in this field and give our insights into advancing CPs for enhanced OECT performance.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Aromatic Nanobelt with Unique Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt was synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of [6]MCPP. Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics, which are likely derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt was synthesized, and its cellular uptake behavior in HeLa cells was investigated. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of the parent methylene&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]MCPP) provided an easily accessible alkyne&#8208;functionalized nanobelt in a single reaction step. The alkyne&#8208;substituted [6]MCPP was subjected to Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition by using a dye&#8208;attached azide to obtain a water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt. Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics. Similar experiments with control molecules and theoretical studies indicated that the unique dynamics of the nanobelt was derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure.

         <title>Artificial Lithium Channels Built from Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with intrinsic microporosity have been used to construct artificial lithium channels. Record&#8208;high transmembrane Li+ transport rates (&#947;Li+ &gt;40 pS) and high Li+ transport selectivity relative to both Na+ and K+ ions (selectivity&gt;10) have been determined using these ion channels. The transport properties can be tuned by adjusting the temperature at which the microporous polymers are synthesized







Abstract
In sharp contrast to numerous artificial potassium channels developed over the past decade, the study of artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels has remained limited. We demonstrate here the use of an interesting class of polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM) for constructing artificial lithium channels. These PIM&#8208;derived lithium channels show exceptionally efficient (&#947;Li+&gt;40 pS) and highly selective transport of Li+ ions, with selectivity factors of&gt;10 against both Na+ and K+. By simply adjusting the initial reaction temperature, we can tune the transport property in a way that PIMs synthesized at initial reaction temperatures of 60&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C exhibit improved transport efficiency and selectivity, respectively, in the dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine membrane.

&lt;p&gt;Polymers with intrinsic microporosity have been used to construct artificial lithium channels. Record-high transmembrane Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport rates (&#947;&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenolysis Rearrangement of Allylic Esters to Access Axially Chiral Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis rearrangement of allylic acetates using (s&#8208;Bu)3BHK has been established, achieving the enantioselective synthesis of non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral alkylidene cycloalkanes with excellent chemo and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This methodology not only offers a powerful tool for the synthesis of these challenging non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral olefins structures, which remain vastly underexplored, but also expands the scope and utility of asymmetric hydrogenolysis reactions, highlighting their versatility and effectiveness in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis rearrangement of allylic acetates using (s&#8208;Bu)3BHK has been described, achieving the synthesis of axially chiral alkylidene cycloalkanes with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and a wide substrate scope (30 examples of cyclohexanes and cyclobutanes). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to achieve synthesis of axially chiral olefins via asymmetric hydrogenolysis of allylic acetates. This methodology not only offers a novel synthetic pathway for non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral structures but also highlights the potential of asymmetric hydrogenolysis as a powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Releasing Polymer Tubesomes: Boosting Gas Delivery of Nanovehicles via Membrane Stretching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;spherical tubesomes are first function as gas&#8208;releasing nanovehicles. By shaping the polymersomes via membrane stretching, one can regulate their length&#8208;diameter ratio (L/D). Such tubesomes can respond to endogenous cysteine to release H2S gas, and an unexpected discovery is that as compared to the spherical carriers, the tubular ones behave far better gas releasing capacity. More importantly, the L/D parameter of tubesomes can dictate the gas releasing kinetics and gas therapeutic efficacy on cancer.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the three gas signaling molecules, not only plays a vital role in mediating a series of cellular activities but also manifests exciting applications in clinical therapy. However, one main obstacle in using H2S as a gaseous therapeutic agent is to realize on&#8208;demand storage and delivery of gas, and thus, it is of great importance to develop H2S&#8208;donating vehicle platforms. Although a variety of polymer&#8208;based gas&#8208;releasing carriers have been designed, almost all the systems are limited to spherical structures. Here we explore the role of polymer self&#8208;assembled morphologies, especially toward those non&#8208;spherical nanostructures, on the H2S release capacity. A kind of tubular polymersomes (i.e. tubesomes), formed by the membrane stretching of polythionoester&#8208;containing block copolymer vesicles, exhibit enhanced cysteine&#8208;responsive H2S&#8208;releasing behavior in contrast to their spherical counterparts. Moreover, we found that the amount and rate of H2S release from diverse polymersomes is relied on the extent of membrane elongation, which allows us to regulate the gas releasing kinetics through tailoring the membrane geometries. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the tubesomes as polymer&#8208;type H2S donors have better anticancer performance than those spherical polymersomes. This would inspire new possibilities to boost gas therapeutic efficacy through shaping the morphology of gas nanovehicles.

         <title>Sulfur Conversion to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder Polymer Networks through Mechanochemical Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state synthetic approach was developed to directly convert elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor molecular junctions, by exploiting mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting sulfur&#8208;rich conjugated polymer exhibits successful CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapor, without adding any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods capable of converting elemental sulfur into conjugated porous sulfur&#8208;rich polymers remains a great challenge, although direct utilization of this readily available feedstock can significantly enrich its uses and circumvent environmental problems during sulfur storage. We report herein mechanochemical (MC) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) that enables sulfur conversion into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) molecular junctions. We demonstrate that the key lies in the generation of bent thianthrene units through a solid&#8208;state ball&#8208;milling condensation reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes and elemental sulfur. We also show that the assembling of D&#8722;A structural motifs into porous networks affords efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. Exceptional photoinduced charge separation along with boosted exciton dissociation results in a high&#8208;performance of carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 306.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by H2O oxidation to O2, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical results. We anticipate this novel MC SNAr approach will advance processing techniques for direct sulfur utilization and facilitate new possibilities for the synthesis of D&#8722;A ladder polymer networks with promising potential in photocatalysis.

         <title>Physical Isolation of Single Protein Molecules within Well&#8208;Defined Coordination Cages to Enhance Their Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unimolecular protein encapsulation in well&#8208;defined coordination cages is demonstrated. 15 Different proteins of varying sizes (3&#8211;6&#8197;nm) and properties were isolated within uniform cavities of size&#8208;tunable cages, 10 of which exhibited enhanced stability against denaturants. Isolation of single proteins in coordination cages thus holds the potential for precise functional control and structural analysis within the well&#8208;defined nanospace.







Abstract
Encapsulation of a single protein within a confined space can lead to distinct properties compared to bulk solutions, but controlling the number of encapsulated proteins and their environment remains challenging. This study demonstrates the encapsulation of single proteins within well&#8208;defined, tunable cavities of self&#8208;assembled coordination cages, thereby enhancing protein stability. Within uniform cavities of size&#8208;tunable coordination cages, 15 different proteins of varying sizes (3&#8211;6&#8197;nm in diameter) and properties (e.g., isoelectric points and hydrophobicity) were successfully confined. Various analytical techniques confirmed that the proteins maintained their secondary structures and enzymatic activities under denaturing conditions such as exposure to organic solvents, heat, and buffers. These findings suggest that such coordination cages have the potential to serve as synthetic hosts for precisely controlling protein functions within their customizable cavities.

         <title>Boosting Propane Dehydrogenation to Propylene via Electron Hole&#8208;Hydrogen Coupling on Cobalt Metal Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hole&#8208;H coupled Co surface induced by introducing a trace amount of separated Pt metals as both hydrogen atoms and holes donors on the same nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supports could help to avoid deep hydrogenolysis and coke deposition, breaking the activity&#8208;stability tradeoff for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane is useful for the high selectivity to propylene but is suffering from the heavy coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Herein, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of a hole&#8208;hydrogen (H) couple on a metallic cobalt surface to decrease the deactivation rate. The coupled H atoms on the Cobalt (Co) surface, partially resulting from propane dehydrogenation, enabled the desorption of propylene to avoid deep hydrogenolysis and coke deposition and realize selective and durable propylene production, while conventional Co metal&#8208;based catalysts do not generate propylene. The optimized hole&#8208;H coupled Co catalyst provided a low deactivation rate (0.0036&#8197;h&#8722;1) and a high turnover frequency (55.6&#8197;h&#8722;1) for propylene production with a high propane flux (48 vol.% C3H8 in gas feeds) at 550&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Network Enabled Gentle Reprogramming of Liquid Crystal Elastomer toward Evolutionary Robot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic hydrogen bonds into liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) created a supramolecular network and enabled modular and reversible LCE assembly under gently temperatures. The behavior of the LCE actuator can be reconfigured and reprogramed on demand. This efficient LCE&#8208;based evolutionary robots is capable of continuous operation in complex environments.







Abstract
In nature, many organisms augment chances of survival by reprogramming their structures to evolving environment, among which sea squirts being a prime example. Such reprogramming has been demonstrated in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuator assembled with heat assistance. However, the required temperature being higher than the actuation temperature limits its application. Here, we reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network LCE to construct soft modular and reprogrammable actuator by assembling with a gentle heat treatment. Leveraging the Michael addition reaction, we introduced hydrogen bonding to the LCE matrix with functionalized pyridine monomers. Experimental and molecular dynamics modeling proved the efficient dynamic hydrogen bond exchange at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly lower than the actuating temperature of the LCE. This gave rise to the reversible and robust adhesion of the same collection of LCE modules capable of being built into different bilayers and performing various morphing upon a short thermal stimulation. Therefore, we demonstrated that these comparatively weak cross&#8208;links enabled reconfiguration of the LCE actuator. With the developed hydrogen&#8208;bonding LCEs, we built proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept modular reprogrammable robot, performing crawling, sailing, and microcircuit repair tasks. This bioinspired and efficient method for evolutionary LCE robot offers a viable path for further development of intelligent actuators sustainable in complex environments.

         <title>Modular Photoswitchable Molecular Glues for Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Control of Protein Function in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. This system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
Optogenetic systems using photosensitive proteins and chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) approaches enabled by chemical dimerizers (also termed molecular glues), are powerful tools to elucidate the dynamics of biological systems and to dissect complex biological regulatory networks. Here, we report a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular, photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that can undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally design the sMGs and further expand their scope by incorporating different photoswitches, resulting in sMGs with customizable properties. We demonstrate that this system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision. This system enables sophisticated optical manipulation of cellular processes and thus opens up a new avenue for chemo&#8208;optogenetics.

         <title>Batrachopolyenes: Volatile Norsteroids from Femoral Scent Glands of Frogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of volatile steroidal natural products, the batrachopolyenes, have been isolated and identified from torrent frogs. A total synthesis established their structure. These norsteroids contain a unique contracted A&#8208;ring and unusual functionalization across the structural core, which were installed along a divergent total synthetic sequence.







Abstract
Steroid hormones are C18&#8208;C21&#8208;sterane derivatives, featuring the typical 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5 ring system. Here we report on a novel C18&#8208;steroid ring system named batrachane with a contracted A&#8208;ring resulting in a 5&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5 ring arrangement. The isolation, structural elucidation, and total synthesis of three members of the novel batrachopolyene family occurring in the tropical frog genus Odontobatrachus is reported. The batrachopolyenes represent an entirely new collection of volatile steroidal natural products produced by anuran amphibians. Alongside the contracted A&#8208;ring, each member contains a &#916;16&#8208;17 double bond but differs in the central belt of the steroidal structure. To create these atypical structural features, syntheses featuring a combination of Breslow radical chain relay chlorination, Favorskii ring contraction, and Clemmensen reduction proved successful. The occurrence of such compounds in another distal anuran group, the Mantellinae, suggests a more widespread distribution of the batrachane&#8208;type compounds among frogs. The new structural steroid type raises questions concerning steroid biosynthesis and reception, as well as distribution in frogs in general and the structures of their hormones.

         <title>Organic Molecule Functionalization Enables Selective Electrochemical Reduction of Dilute CO2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an organic molecule functionalization strategy to boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. With a functionalized Bi catalyst, we attained a formate Faradaic efficiency of 85.8&#8201;% with dilute feedstock (15&#8201;% CO2) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30&#8197;h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production from dilute CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 feedstock to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is a promising pathway for achieving direct valorization of waste gas streams. However, this is challenging due to significant competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowered CO2 reduction (CO2R) kinetics as compared to systems that employ pure CO2. Here we show that terephthalic acid (TPA) functionalization can boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. For instance, TPA functionalized Bi attained a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 96.3&#8201;% at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with pure CO2 feedstock. Density functional theory simulations indicate that this is because TPA functionalization modulates the binding energies of the key reaction intermediates *OCHO and *H. With low&#8208;concentration feedstock (15&#8201;% CO2) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, we achieved a high FEHCOO&#8208; of 85.8&#8201;%, which was double that of an unmodified Bi catalyst. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30&#8197;h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production with a 5&#8201;% CO2 feed. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO2R using low&#8208;concentration feedstock.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction under physiological conditions. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2) for quantitatively and precisely visualizing H2S2 fluctuations in LPS/MET&#8208;induced liver injury.







Abstract
Hydrogen persulfide (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2) for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#8197;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.

         <title>A Universal Design of Lithium Anode via Dynamic Stability Strategy for Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable electroplating technique engineers thin Li metal anode (LMA) with a dual&#8208;layered interphase&#8212;solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI)&#8212;which enhances ionic conductivity and suppresses dendrite formation. This design enables rapid Li+ transport and reduce resistance in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), thus leading to exceptional battery performance and paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SSB with LMA.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery (ASSLB) chemistry with thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) membranes features high energy density and intrinsic safety but suffers from severe dendrite formation and poor interface contact during cycling, which hampers the practical application of rechargeable ASSLB. Here, we propose a universal design of thin Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) via a dynamic stability strategy to address these issues. The ultra&#8208;thin LMA (20&#8197;&#956;m) is in situ constructed with uniform highly Li&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI) via electroplating process. As a result, the passivation layer with poor Li&#8208;ion conduction on Li anode can be dissolved and small surface resistance can be achieved due to the good compatibility of CPI to SSEs. The cycling of Li symmetric cell with Li6PS5Cl thin film electrolyte (&lt;100&#8197;&#956;m) shows a high critical current density of &gt;2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycling stability at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The ASSLBs paring with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode demonstrated the feasibility of engineered LMA design by presenting good rate capability from 0.1&#8197;C to 1.0&#8197;C at room temperature, as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability (81&#8201;% retention after 100&#8197;cycles). This work represents a general pathway to make thin dendrite&#8208;free LMA available for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.

         <title>Urea/Thiourea Imine Linkages Provide Accessible Holes in Flexible Covalent Organic Frameworks and Dominates Self&#8208;Adaptivity and Exciton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;flexible covalent organic frameworks (mf&#8208;COFs) with thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting intralayer contraction/expansion behavior in response to guest molecule. Compared with pure imine bonds, the presence of thio(urea) basis in mf&#8208;COFs improve mass transfer, self&#8208;adaptivity and electronic interactions, significantly enhancing their efficiency in micropollutant elimination in wastewater.







Abstract
Unraveling the robust self&#8208;adaptivity and minimal energy&#8208;dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top&#8208;down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace&#8208;guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro&#8208;soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene&#8208;based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro&#8208;flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro&#8208;flexible thiourea&#8208;COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100&#8201;% removal of micropollutant with low&#8208;energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes&#8208;mediated micropollutant decomposition.

&lt;p&gt;Micro-flexible covalent organic frameworks (mf-COFs) with thio(urea)-basis-dominated linkage have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting intralayer contraction/expansion behavior in response to guest molecule. Compared with pure imine bonds, the presence of thio(urea) basis in mf-COFs improve mass transfer, self-adaptivity and electronic interactions, significantly enhancing their efficiency in micropollutant elimination in wastewater.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the robust self-adaptivity and minimal energy-dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top-down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace-guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro-soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)-basis-dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene-based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro-flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro-flexible thiourea-COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100&#8201;% removal of micropollutant with low-energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes-mediated micropollutant decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imperfections Immobilization and Regeneration in Perovskite with Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Assembly for Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly of nickel octaethylporphyrin in perovskite films serves a dual function: acting as an immobilizer for volatile iodine produced by iodide oxidation and as a redox shuttle to regenerate impurities such as elemental lead and iodine. Modified devices without encapsulation exhibit significantly enhanced performance and stability. These findings highlight the potential of redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite photovoltaics.







Abstract
Imperfections in metal halide perovskites, such as those induced by light exposure or thermal stress, compromise device performance and stability. A key challenge is immobilizing volatile iodine produced by iodide oxidation and regenerating impurities like elemental lead and iodine. Here, we address this by integrating a redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly of nickel octaethylporphyrin into perovskite film, functioning as both an immobilizer and redox shuttle. Decorated ethyl groups in porphyrin distorts the &#960; ring, increasing the axial ligand adsorption capacity of central metal ion, while reducing intermolecular interactions and promoting iodine adsorption achieving a maximum uptake of 3.83&#8197;mg&#8201;mg&#8722;1 to iodine. Adsorbed iodine transfers more electrons to Ni ions, leading to a weakened interaction within I&#8722;I bond and facilitating the production of iodide ions. Such a situation further enables selective oxidation of metallic lead defects to Pb2+. Porphyrin supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grain boundaries, leading to a champion device efficiency of 25.37&#8201;% for a 0.10&#8197;cm2 active area, outperforms the value of control device being 23.96&#8201;%. Modified devices without encapsulation exhibit significantly enhanced stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial performance after 1,000&#8197;hours of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Functional Characterization and Molecular Basis of a Multi&#8208;Site Halogenase in Naphthacemycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FasV&#8208;catalyzed multiple halogenations in naphthacemycin biosynthesis were elucidated, which led to the discovery of previously unrecognized amino acid residues critical for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. These findings suggest a novel dual&#8208;activation mechanism and demonstrate its biocatalytic potential for a broader range of phenolic hydroxy&#8208;containing substrates with diverse structural frameworks.







Abstract
Halogenases are spurring a growing interest in the fields of biosynthesis and biocatalysis. Although various halogenases have been identified in numerous natural product biosynthetic pathways, the mechanisms for multiple halogenations and site&#8208;selectivity remain largely unclear. In this study, we biochemically characterized FasV, a flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes five successive chlorinations in the biosynthesis of the naphthacene&#8208;containing aromatic polyketide naphthacemycin. This multiple halogenation reaction was elucidated to occur in an orderly fashion, as evidenced by enzyme kinetics, time&#8208;course assays, and computational simulations. Crystallographic analyses and mutagenesis studies revealed previously unrecognized amino acid residues, including T53, L81, F93, and I212, that are crucial for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. Based on this, a I212T mutant was generated to exclusively catalyze selective monohalogenation. We propose a novel dual&#8208;activation mechanism and demonstrate that the larger binding pocket of FasV makes it a valuable biocatalyst for other substrates with diverse structures. Therefore, this study provides new insight into multi&#8208;site polyhalogenases and highlights the potential for engineering FasV&#8208;like FDHs for biocatalytic applications.

Spirocycles: Spirocyclic azetidines serve as valuable isosteres of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. This work describes the first extended library of previously rare &#8220;angular&#8221; spirocyclic azetidines, from synthesis protocols to structural, physicochemical, and biochemical properties.







Abstract
The previously neglected &#8220;angular&#8221; spirocyclic azetidines have been synthesized, characterized, and validated in drug discovery. We have shown that these compounds could act as bioisosteres for common saturated six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Their incorporation into the structure of the anticancer drug Sonidegib (instead of morpholine), and Danofloxacine (instead of piperazine) provided novel patent&#8208;free analogs with similar physicochemical properties and high activity.

The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction between boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) and a variety of naphthodiazoquinones and diazoindenines via C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation pathways selectively leads to 2&#8208;(hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The synthetic value of the procedures is showcased by BODIPY&#8208;derived functional molecule construction and scaffold diversification. Bioapplications of tailored BODIPYs indicate their promising properties in multidisciplinary research.







Abstract
The molecular engineering of boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) has garnered widespread attention due to their structural diversity enabling tailored physicochemical properties for optimal applications. However, catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse boron&#8208;stereogenic BODIPYs through intermolecular desymmetrization and BODIPYs with atroposelectivity remains elusive. Here, we showcase rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific C&#8722;H (hetero)arylations of prochiral BODIPYs and polysubstituted BODIPYs with diazonaphthoquinonesand diazoindenines, providing efficient pathways for the rapid assembly of versatile (hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs through long&#8208;range desymmetrization and axial rotational restriction modes. The synthetic application of the procedures has been emphasized by the efficient synthesis of BODIPY derivatives with various functions. Photophysical properties, bioimaging, and lipid droplet&#8208;specific targeting capability of tailored BODIPYs are also demonstrated, indicating their promising applications in biomedical research, medicinal chemistry, and material science.

         <title>Enhanced Antitumor Immunity of a Globo H&#8208;Based Vaccine Enabled by the Combination Adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21</title>

An adjuvant&#8208;assisted Globo H&#8208;based vaccine platform has been established including semi&#8208;synthetic Globo H&#8208;CRM197 glycoconjugate vaccines formulated with synthetic 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL), saponin QS&#8208;21, &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34 and their combinations. Immunological evaluations suggest that Globo H&#8208;based vaccine formulated with the combination adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21 exhibited an enhanced antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Globo H, a specific carbohydrate antigen overexpressed on various human malignancies, has attracted considerable interest as an antigenic target for anticancer vaccine development. Despite several Globo H&#8208;based carbohydrate vaccines that have been designed, efficient access to Globo H hexasaccharide antigen and development of powerful adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity remain challenging. Herein, we reported a streamlined chemoenzymatic approach to prepare this hexasaccharide antigen, relying on chemical synthesis of Gb5 pentasaccharide by a stereoconvergent [2+3] strategy and subsequent enzymatic &#945;&#8208;fucosylation to easily install &#945;1,2&#8208;fucose residue. Separately, a modular assembly approach to efficiently synthesize 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL) was developed by the integration of stereocontrolled glycosylation, regioselective acylation, site&#8208;specific phosphorylation, and facile global deprotection. After efficient construction of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate, we conducted systematic immunological evaluations of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 formulated with various adjuvants and adjuvant combinations, comprising saponin QS&#8208;21, synthetic 3D&#8208;MPL and &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34. The results revealed that Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate adjuvanted with QS&#8208;21 and 3D&#8208;MPL elicited robust IgG2a and IgG3 antibody responses and Th1 cellular immunity in mice. Moreover, antibodies induced by this formulation effectively bound to Globo H&#8208;positive MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells and exhibited superior complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis, holding promise for further development of effective anticancer vaccines.

         <title>Optically Modulated Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanofluidic neuromorphic device based on metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) was presented, which can be controllably modulated by the light stimulation for emulating biological synaptic behaviors. This work opens up an avenue toward advanced applications using nanofluidic iontronic systems, such as brain&#8208;mimicking computing and brain&#8208;computer interfaces.







Abstract
Neuromorphic systems that can emulate the behavior of neurons have garnered increasing interest across interdisciplinary fields due to their potential applications in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the optical modulation of nanofluidic ion transport for neuromorphic functions has been scarcely reported. Herein, inspired by biological systems that rely on ions as signal carriers for information perception and processing, we present a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) with optically modulated ion transport properties, which can mimic the functions of biological synapses. Through the dynamic modulation of synaptic weight, we successfully replicate intricate learning&#8208;experience behaviors and Pavlovian associate learning processes by employing sequential optical stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the International Morse Code with the nanofluidic device using patterned optical pulse signals, showing its encoding and decoding capabilities in information processing process. This study would largely advance the development of nanofluidic neuromorphic devices for biomimetic iontronics integrated with sensing, memory and computing functions.

         <title>Stereospecific 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement Interrupted Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI). Both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities by means of enantioselective allylic arylation and atroposelective alkenylation, respectively.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution with alkyl and heteroaryl carbon nucleophiles has been well&#8208;established. However, the asymmetric allylic arylation of acyclic internal alkenes with aryl nucleophiles remains challenging and underdeveloped. Herein we report a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI) that enables asymmetric allylic arylation. By means of this stepwise strategy, both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities. Experimental studies support a mechanism involving a cascade of asymmetric allylic amination, stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement and alkene isomerization. Density functional theory studies detailed the reasons of achieving the high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, respectively.

         <title>An Expeditious Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Imide&#8208;Based Graphene Nanoribbons and Their Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the bay region of polyperylene with mono and diimide functional groups has enabled the synthesis of robust graphene nanoribbons. These nanoribbons are solution&#8208;processable and show good NIR absorption and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with low band gap and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are potential candidates for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. In this context, imide&#8208;based GNRs are promising, but there are no rational design principles that yield these robust GNRs with strong NIR absorption. Here, we demonstrate a rational synthesis route to achieve NIR&#8208;absorbing imide&#8208;based robust GNRs by exploring the bay region of polyperylene (PP). Using the oxidative Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, we have successfully introduced mono and diimide functional groups on PP. After cyclodehydrogenation, the resultant GNRs, benzoperylene imide GNR (BPI&#8208;GNR) and coronene diimide GNR (CDI&#8208;GNR), show oscillatory edge geometry with strong NIR absorption (up to 1000&#8197;nm) and optical band gap of ~1.3&#8197;eV. Computational studies also indicate that imide substituents play an important role in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of GNRs. Moreover, these GNRs are solution&#8208;processable and can be made into thin films via spray coating. Owing to the strong NIR absorption and imide substitutions, BPI and CDI&#8208;GNRs show good photothermal conversion with excellent cyclic stability.

         <title>Rapid Na+ Transport Pathway and Stable Interface Design Enabling Ultralong Life Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium metal batteries using succinonitrile&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes are developed by finely modulating the Na+ transfer pathway and SEI composition. Benefit from the rational design of the polymer network in this electrolyte. The &#8220;biphase coexistence&#8221; Na+ transfer channel was constructed and the SEI composition was optimized. Thus, the Na+ migration kinetics in the electrolyte and the SEI are simultaneously improved.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) using solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show impressive superiority in energy density and safety. As promising candidates for SPEs, solid&#8208;state plastic crystal electrolytes (SPCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) plastic crystal could achieve high ion conductivity and wide voltage window. Nonetheless, the notorious SN decomposition reaction on the electrode/electrolyte interface seriously challenges the stable operation of the battery. To address this drawback, we commence with the structural engineering of the polymer chain segments in SPCE and employ intermolecular interactions to optimize the composition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of polymer network design in optimizing the migration behavior of sodium ions in SPCE. The assembled sodium symmetric cells display a high critical current density of up to 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling performance for 700&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Na/SPCE&#8208;9/Na3V2(PO4)3 maintains a discharge specific capacity of up to 76.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C and shows impressive long&#8208;cycle stability, retaining 86.2&#8201;% of initial capacity over 5000&#8197;cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. Our work presents a high&#8208;performance SPCE with intrinsic safety, providing valuable insights for the future design of solid&#8208;state SMBs.

     alt="Rapid Na+ Transport Pathway and Stable Interface Design Enabling Ultralong Life Solid-State Sodium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium metal batteries using succinonitrile-based solid-state electrolytes are developed by finely modulating the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer pathway and SEI composition. Benefit from the rational design of the polymer network in this electrolyte. The &#8220;biphase coexistence&#8221; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer channel was constructed and the SEI composition was optimized. Thus, the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration kinetics in the electrolyte and the SEI are simultaneously improved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-metal batteries (SMBs) using solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show impressive superiority in energy density and safety. As promising candidates for SPEs, solid-state plastic crystal electrolytes (SPCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) plastic crystal could achieve high ion conductivity and wide voltage window. Nonetheless, the notorious SN decomposition reaction on the electrode/electrolyte interface seriously challenges the stable operation of the battery. To address this drawback, we commence with the structural engineering of the polymer chain segments in SPCE and employ intermolecular interactions to optimize the composition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of polymer network design in optimizing the migration behavior of sodium ions in SPCE. The assembled sodium symmetric cells display a high critical current density of up to 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling performance for 700&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the Na/SPCE-9/Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; maintains a discharge specific capacity of up to 76.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;C and shows impressive long-cycle stability, retaining 86.2&#8201;% of initial capacity over 5000&#8197;cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. Our work presents a high-performance SPCE with intrinsic safety, providing valuable insights for the future design of solid-state SMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pt Loaded on MOF&#8208;Derived Porous TiO2 with Maxim&#8208;Ized Pt Atom Utilization for Selective Hydrogenation of Halonitro&#8208;benzene</title>

The precise location control of single atoms relative to supports remains a great challenge in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, through a simple &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; process, the preferential dispersion of single&#8208;atom Pt species outside TiO2 is realzied by decoupling the themolysis of a typical Ti&#8208;based MOF and thermal atomization of PtNPs. The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600, with 100&#8201;% Pt accessibility, exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB) to p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN).







Abstract
The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800&#8201;&#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600&#8201;&#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99&#8201;%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45&#8201;%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100&#8201;% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Methanolation of Olefins: Low&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Alcohols by the Formal Addition of Methanol to Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanolation of olefins&#8212;the one&#8208;pot 100&#8201;% atom efficient addition of methanol to olefins yielding C1 elongated alcohols&#8212;is achieved using an integrated catalytic system based on the combination of organometallic Mn/pincer and Rh/phosphine catalysts.







Abstract
Methanolation of olefins is introduced as a new low&#8208;pressure synthetic pathway to C1 elongated alcohols. Formally, H3COH is added to the C=C bond in a 100&#8201;% atom efficient manner. Mechanistically, the overall transformation occurs as a tandem reaction sequence by combining the dehydrogenation of methanol to syngas at a CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 with subsequent hydroformylation to the corresponding aldehyde and its final hydrogenation to the alcohol. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps are catalyzed by a Mn/pincer complex, while the hydroformylation is accomplished by a Rh/phosphine catalyst. Using 1&#8208;octene as prototypical substrate, a yield of 80&#8201;% nonanol was achieved with a ratio of 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 of linear to branched alcohols and turnover numbers (TONRh) of more than 17 000 could be obtained in relation to the precious metal Rhodium. The integrated catalytic system provides direct access to alcohols from olefins and &#8220;green&#8221; methanol, avoiding the handling of pressurized CO and H2 and the use of specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment as the process conditions do not exceed 10&#8197;bar with partial pressures of syngas in the range of only 1&#8211;2&#8197;bar.

         <title>Molecular Chain Rearrangement of Natural Cellulose&#8208;Based Artificial Interphase for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase constructed by molecular chain rearrangement strategy is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anodes (e.g., an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.) This designed interphase, featuring a synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry, demonstrate a huge potential of natural polymers materials for advanced energy storage applications.







Abstract
The unstable electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, plagued by parasitic side reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth, severely hampers the practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a regenerated cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase with synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry on the Zn anode (RC@Zn), using a facile molecular chain rearrangement strategy. This RC interphase features a drastically increased amorphous region and more exposed active hydroxyl groups, facilitating rapid Zn2+ diffusion and homogeneous Zn2+ interface distribution, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Additionally, the compact texture and abundant negatively charged surface of the RC interphase effectively shield water molecules and harmful anions, completely preventing H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. The superior mechanical strength and adhesion of the RC interphase also accommodate the substantial volume changes of Zn anodes even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently, the RC@Zn electrode demonstrates an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Significantly, the electrode maintains stable cycling even at a 90&#8201;% depth of discharge and ensures stable operation of full cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.6. This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically chiral dimeric molecules can achieve high chirality transfer efficiency when co&#8208;assembled with monomeric counterparts or inorganic nanomaterials, regardless of their packing structures. This process enables the fabrication of chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties, which are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8208;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer in Hybrid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Boosted Interface Stability and Ion Conduction</title>

A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of LLZTO powders is constructed to inhibit the Li+/H+ exchange reaction and provide extra Lewis acid&#8208;base site, which achieving the establishment of a long&#8208;term local conducive microenvironment of Li+ conduction on the surface of LLZTO. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating solvation structure for the hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte.







Abstract
Complex interactions between the inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) and the liquid electrolyte (LE) give rise to challenges of achieving durable interface stability in hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (HQSE), and the influence on the involved ISE surface ionic conductivity also needs to be investigated. Here, 4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (CBSA) is utilized to establish a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO), which is then incorporated into PEGDA&#8208;based in situ polymerized HQSE. The results show that the introduction of CBSA significantly improves the LLZTO/LE interface stability with the optimized solvation structure, resulting in a favorable ionic conductivity (1.19 mS&#8901;cm&#8722;1) and an increasing Li+ transference number (0.647). Mechanisms for the promotion of ionic conduction and interfacial stability of SAM&#8208;HQSE are unveiled through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Raman spectra and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear&#8208;magnetic&#8208;resonance. There are no short&#8208;circuits in the Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells after 1000&#8197;h. The LFP|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells or LFP|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Graphite pouch cells respectively achieve the capacity retention of 91.2&#8201;% and 87.0&#8201;% with the 0.5.C&#8208;rate for 500 and 300&#8197;cycles. This facile and effective strategy proposed in this work make it accessible for constructing the stable surface micro&#8208;environments of LLZTO where boost and homogenize the Li+ conduction in a hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte system.

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanorods by Synchronized Polymerization, Self&#8208;Assembly and Oriented Attachment for Utilization in Magnetically Responsive Displays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy based on oriented attachment, synchronized with polymerization and self&#8208;assembly was reported to achieve single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) homopolymer nanorods. The strategy was realized by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. The resulting LC nanorods further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods.







Abstract
The creation of anisotropic nanoparticles (NPs) by polymerization and/or self&#8208;assembly (SA) has significantly promoted the applications of polymer nanomaterials in many fields. However, polymer nanorods are not easily accessible via conventional polymerization or SA. Here we report a one&#8208;step route to synthesize single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) nanorods utilizing oriented attachment (OA) that was usually found in the synthesis of inorganic NPs, synchronized with polymerization and SA. The synchronization was achieved by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. Mechanistic studies reveal that controlling the thermo&#8208;responsive behavior and the distribution of stabilizers on NPs enabled OA. The LC nanorods can further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this LC system can be manipulated by an external magnetic field, thus providing a candidate material for magnetic&#8208;responsive display.

A novel flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) can achieve dynamic structural changes from closed to open under the stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibits adaptive adsorption for C3H6 and C3H8, and exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent gate opening phenomenon, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures.







Abstract
The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra (4&#8208;cyanophenyl) tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N

H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures.

Utilizing seawater as an electrolyte enables efficient hydrogen peroxide production for coastal applications. The NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst, synthesized via pyrolysis of silk, achieves 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 H2O2 with a faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, offering a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective method for on&#8208;site production in coastal region.







Abstract
Developing seawater&#8208;compatible hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction technologies is crucial for advancing marine resource utilization in coastal regions. However, designing efficient and highly stable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in seawater environment remains a challenging task due to the corrosive and toxic nature of chloride ions (Cl&#8722;). Herein, we present, for the first time, a novel nitrogen and oxygen self&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon (NO&#8208;DC700) catalyst, derived from silk fiber, which addresses these challenges with low toxicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high adaptability. The obtained NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst demonstrates an impressive H2O2 production rate of up to 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, and produces 4.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2 after 20&#8197;hours of stable operation, placing it among the highest&#8208;performing catalysts reported in neutral electrolytes. Theoretical calculations reveal that NO&#8208;DC700&#8242;s superior 2e&#8722; ORR performance is due to the synergistic effect of graphitic nitrogen and C&#8208;OH, which inhibits Cl&#8722; adsorption and promotes *OOH adsorption. Additionally, integrating 2e&#8722; ORR with Fenton&#8208;like technology enables rapid degradation of organic pollutants and effective inactivation of seawater algae, offering significant potential for mitigating coastal eutrophication and red tide pollution. This work provides valuable insights into H2O2 electrosynthesis in seawater solution and promises advancements in ocean&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Pt nanoparticles (NP) without oxidic overlayer on rutile (Ptex/R) and the encapsulated Pt NP on rutile (Pten/R) were synthesized based on the difference of support properties. Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction (SMSI) was modulated on rutile supported Pt NP over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8211;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It was found that oxygen vacancy (Ov) defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by modulating the metal&#8208;support interaction. Through a combination of DFT calculations, it is found that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile was reduced by Ov on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species, which hinders the adsorption of Pt NP on the oxidic overlayer and prevents the formation of SMSI.







Abstract
The catalytic activities and stability of oxide&#8208;supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8211;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI. Pt/rutile with oxygen vacancies achieves a 301 molCO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gM&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 space time yield and considerably catalytic stability (decreased by 8&#8201;%) at 800&#8201;&#176;C over 100&#8197;h time&#8208;on&#8208;stream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption capacity of Pt NP on the rutile overlayer can be reduced by increasing electron density. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile is reduced by the oxygen vacancy defects on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species during CO2 hydrogenation, thereby preventing the formation of SMSI.

A directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes has been developed via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol.







Abstract
We report herein a directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes enabled via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol. The acetate ligand of the palladium catalyst controls the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity in the desired transformation. The potential of this concept has been demonstrated by the development of the chiral version of this transformation by using axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer with good yields and enantioselectivities. Detailed investigations, including kinetic studies, order studies, and DFT studies, were performed to validate the ligand&#8208;assisted nucleopalladation process and the rationale behind the observed racemization of chiral allenes. The studies also indicated that the anti&#8208;carboxypalladation step was the rate&#8208;limiting as well as the stereo&#8208; and enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Azopyridine Polymers in Organic Phase Change Materials for High Energy Density Photothermal Storage and Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

The meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer (3&#8208;PAZOPY with an unprecedented untra&#8208;high energy density of 430&#8197;J/g forms a stable uniform two&#8208;phase hybrid composite system with the organic phase change material octanoic acid (OA) through a combination of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This system, serving as a noval solar photothermal fuels (STFs), is capable of simultaneously storing both photochemical and phase change energy, which holds significant potential for applications in household consumers energy distribution and utilization systems, as well as in photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategies.







Abstract
Azo&#8208;compounds molecules and phase change materials offer potential applications for sustainable energy systems through the storage and controllable release photochemical and phase change energy. Developing novel and highly efficient Azo&#8208;based solar thermal fuels (STFs) for photothermal energy storage and synergistic cooperation with organic phase change materials present significant challenges. Herein, three types of (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) azopyridine polymers hinged with flexible alkyl chain are synthesized, in which meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer exhibits striking photothermal storage capacity of 430&#8197;J/g, providing a feasibility solution for developing high energy density Azo&#8208;based STFs. Furthermore, a stable two&#8208;phase hybrid system was innovatively constructed by combining the meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer with organic phase change materials leveraging hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to collectively harness phase change energy and photothermal energy. The organic phase change material not only supplies additional phase change latent heat but also serves as a solvent, offering abundant free volume for the photo&#8208;induced isomerization of the azopyridine chromophores, which successfully circumvents the low charging efficiency in the condensed state and reliance on solvent&#8208;assisted charging in traditional Azo&#8208;based STFs. This study demonstrates the energy distribution and utilization for household consumers and the photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategy, achieving more extensive potential implementation for STFs.

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) acts as a strong oxidant under visible light irradiation. This excited&#8208;state reactivity provides a potent manifold to perform heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of amines into imines under flow conditions with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. The inline generation of imine can be telescoped to Ugi&#8208;3CR under batch and flow conditions toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.







Abstract
Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8901;&#8722;)=+1.67&#8197;V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.

         <title>The Amplification of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils is Suppressed under Fully Quiescent Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital seed amplification assays in microemulsion droplets for the diagnostics of Parkinson's disease would be highly valuable. However, such assays are rendered challenging by the fact that fibril amplification by fragmentation or secondary nucleation is strongly suppressed under the fully quiescent conditions inside the droplets. Ultrasonic agitation allowed the successful amplification of pre&#8208;formed seeds and those from PD brains inside microemulsion droplets under acidic solution conditions.







Abstract
Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient&#8208;derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate&#8208;based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high&#8208;frequency vibrations using a piezo device. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the physical requirements of alpha&#8208;synuclein seed amplification and demonstrate a pathway towards the development of effective digital SAAs.

         <title>Modulating the Coverage of Adsorbed Hydrogen via Hydrogen Spillover Enables Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modulated the surface coverage of adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) on Pt via hydrogen spillover in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst (Pt/TiO2), which exhibited a high selectivity (94&#8201;%) and good Faradaic efficiency (FE, 63&#8201;%) for cyclohexanone. We revealed that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributed to low adsorbed hydrogen species coverage over Pt, which effectively hindered over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol is a sustainable route to produce cyclohexanone, an industrially important feedstock for polymer synthesis. However, attaining high selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) for cyclohexanone remain challenging, owning to over&#8208;hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing hydrogen spillover effect, we modulate adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) coverage on Pt surface via migration to TiO2 in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. In ECH of phenol, a high selectivity (94&#8201;%) and good FE (63&#8201;%) for cyclohexanone are obtained, showing more advantageous performance compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Hads migrated from Pt to TiO2. We propose that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributes to low Hads coverage over Pt, which effectively hinders over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER. We establish a scaling relationship between the intensity of hydrogen spillover and cyclohexanone selectivity by varying the types of anatase TiO2, and show the universality of the strategy over other reducible metal oxides as the support (rutile TiO2, CeO2 and WO3). This work showcases an effective strategy for tuning hydrogenation selectivity in electro&#8208;catalysis, by taking advantage of thermo&#8208;catalytically well&#8208;documented hydrogen spillover effect.

         <title>Thermal Bistability of Magnetic Susceptibility, Light Absorption, Second Harmonic Generation, and Dielectric Properties in a Polar Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron&#8211;Rhenium Chain Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) centers with phenyl isonicotinate and octacyanidorhenate(V) leads to a polar molecule&#8208;based material incorporating heterometallic Fe(II)&#8722;Re(V) cyanido&#8208;bridged chains. It exhibits a thermally induced cooperative spin crossover (high&#8208;spin&#8208;to&#8208;low&#8208;spin) transition on Fe(II) sites which results in remarkable thermal bistability of magnetic, visible&#8208;light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation, and dielectric properties.







Abstract
The bistability of multiple physical properties driven by external stimuli in a solid is a desired prerequisite for its application in memory devices with convenient data readout. We present a pathway for thermal bistability detectable in four physical properties: magnetic, light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and dielectric. We report a novel heterometallic (TBA){[FeII(phIN)4][ReV(CN)8]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(phIN) (1) (TBA=tetrabutylammonium cation, phIN=phenyl isonicotinate) cyanido&#8208;bridged chain material. Owing to an appropriate {N6} coordination sphere of Fe(II) centers, 1 reveals a thermal spin crossover (SCO) effect which is complete and cooperative providing a distinct thermal hysteresis loop in magnetic measurements. Moreover, it exhibits simultaneous thermal bistability in (a) visible&#8208;light absorption due to the presence of efficient d&#8208;d electronic transitions in the low&#8208;spin (LS) state, (b) SHG activity as it crystallizes in a polar Cc space group due to the bulky substituent on phIN ligands, and (c) dielectric parameters, including dielectric constant, which can be correlated with subtle changes in polarity between LS and HS (high spin) phases. Thus, we present a remarkable thermally controlled hysteretic behavior in four physical functionalities realized by properly functionalizing an SCO&#8208;active coordination compound.

         <title>Freestanding Phosphonium Covalent Organic Frameworks with Efficient Hydroxide Conduction for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline&#8208;stable phosphonium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) work as durable and efficient hydroxide conductors for zinc&#8211;air battery applications. Especially, the COFs with a minimal ion exchange capacity of 1.17&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 resulted in 126&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and batteries with the COF electrolytes demonstrated stable operation over 2,300&#8197;min.







Abstract
Owing to their well&#8208;defined crystalline pore structures and ordered functional ionic groups along the skeleton, ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) exhibit excellent performance and have significant potential for use in energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we for the first time developed cationic phosphonium COFs with high hydroxide conduction even with low ion exchange capacity (IEC). Specifically, we synthesized COFs containing quaternary phosphonium groups as excellent ion transport moieties. Then, we fabricated freestanding phosphonium membranes through a vapor&#8208;assisted method, which exhibited high hydroxide conductivity of 126&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C from a minimal IEC of 1.17&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The resulting film was successfully applied to zinc&#8211;air batteries, demonstrating energy density of 96.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 95.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable operation over 2,300&#8197;min. Overall, in addition to investigating a novel cationic functional group, we demonstrated a freestanding film formation method of COF&#8208;based materials. The findings can provide a solid foundation for advancing the field of iCOFs to ion transport and promoting electrochemical applications.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion by Limiting Interfacial Hydroxyl Radicals Using Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiVO4 with surface Au nanoparticle&#8208;functionalization (BiVO4@Au) was fabricated to enable both photogeneration and in situ consumption of &#8901;OH radicals near the photocatalytic interface, leading to a much enhanced &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio for C&#8722;C coupling toward direct and efficient photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol with high selectivity is attractive but substantially challenging. The activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds at ambient conditions requires highly reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), while the presence of those oxidative species also facilitates fast formation of C1 products, instead of the kinetically sluggish C&#8722;C coupling to produce ethanol. Herein, we developed a BiVO4 photocatalyst with surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles (BiVO4@Au), which not only enables photogeneration of &#8901;OH to activate CH4 into &#8901;CH3, but also in situ consumes those &#8901;OH species to retard their further attack on &#8901;CH3, resulting in an enhanced &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio and facilitating C&#8722;C coupling toward ethanol. The &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio is further improved by transporting CH4 via a gas&#8208;diffusion layer to the photocatalytic interface, leading to even higher ethanol selectivity and production rates. At ambient conditions and without photosensitizers or sacrificial agents, the BiVO4@Au photocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion performance, including a peak ethanol yield of 680&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, a high selectivity of 86&#8201;%, and a stable photoconversion of &gt;100&#8197;h, substantially exceeding most of the previous reports. Our work suggests an attractive approach of in situ generation and modulation of the &#8901;OH levels for photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Anthracene&#8208;Fused Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole: Synthesis, Structure, Assembly with C60, and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple fusion of a Ni(II) norcorrole unit with anthracene units deforms the antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated core into a bowl&#8208;shaped conformation, which enables effective fullerene binding in the solution and solid states via convex&#8211;concave interactions. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the anthracene moieties enhances the absorption bands into the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region. The NIR&#8208;absorbing properties of the fused anthrylnorcorroles together with their antiaromatic character induce effective photothermal&#8208;conversion properties.







Abstract
The synthesis of bowl&#8208;shaped antiaromatic molecules is challenging because the molecular distortion further destabilizes these already inherently reactive molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of bowl&#8208;shaped fused anthrylnorcorroles that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1900&#8197;nm. The oxidation of meso&#8208;anthryldibromodipyrrin provides fused anthryldibromodipyrrin, which was converted to the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles through Ni(0)&#8208;mediated intramolecular coupling with a bis(dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed bowl&#8208;shaped structures for the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles, which enables them to act as suitable receptors for C60 with bonding constants of 2.89&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 1.59&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between the fused monoanthrylnorcorrole and C60 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effective expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the triple fusion of the norcorrole with the anthracene units substantially enhances the near&#8208;infrared absorption bands, which endows these anthrylnorcorroles with effective photothermal conversion.

         <title>Harnessing of Cooperative Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Interactions for Luminescent Low&#8208;Coordinate Copper(I) Complexes towards Stable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular anagostic Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions are leveraged for the design of luminescent low&#8208;coordinate copper(I) complexes. Without using sterically bulky substituents on the carbene ligand, the copper(I) complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability. Featuring with high&#8208;efficiency and short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, the copper(I) complexes demonstrate exceptional electroluminescence properties with high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes are highly promising low&#8208;cost emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the exposed metal center in the linear coordination geometry makes them suffer from poor stability. Herein, we describe a strategy to develop stable carbene&#8208;Cu&#8208;amide complexes through installing intramolecular noncovalent Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. The employment of 13H&#8208;dibenzo[a,i]carbazole (DBC) as the amide ligand leads to short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances in addition to the Cu&#8722;N coordination bond. The resultant Cu(I) complexes exhibit yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 86&#8201;% and radiative decay rate constants on the order of 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Comparing with the analogues without Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions, the pincer complexes have significantly improved stability. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs show high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 29.5&#8201;% and extremely small roll&#8208;offs of only 3.5&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Remarkably, the operational lifetimes (LT90) are up to 68&#8197;h with an initial luminance of 3000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This work proves a feasible design of robust low&#8208;coordinate metal complexes by leveraging secondary coordination interactions, which helps to overcome the long&#8208;standing stability problem.

Herein, we describe a strategy to develop stable carbene-Cu-amide complexes through installing intramolecular noncovalent Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. The employment of 13H-dibenzo[a,i]carbazole (DBC) as the amide ligand leads to short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances in addition to the Cu&#8722;N coordination bond. The resultant Cu(I) complexes exhibit yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 86&#8201;% and radiative decay rate constants on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Comparing with the analogues without Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions, the pincer complexes have significantly improved stability. The vacuum-deposited OLEDs show high-performance electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 29.5&#8201;% and extremely small roll-offs of only 3.5&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Remarkably, the operational lifetimes (LT&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) are up to 68&#8197;h with an initial luminance of 3000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work proves a feasible design of robust low-coordinate metal complexes by leveraging secondary coordination interactions, which helps to overcome the long-standing stability problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Modular Assembly of Homochiral Ir(III)&#8208;Metallohelices to Reverse Metallodrug Resistance by Inhibiting CDK1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel programmable modular assembly approach was developed for the construction of homochiral, luminescent dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices with flexible dithiourea linkages. The metallohelices exhibit significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities and CDK1&#8208;specific targeting ability, offering innovative insights into the design of chiral helical metallodrugs aimed at reversing metallodrug resistance.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer recurrence and poor prognosis. The innovative design and synthesis of inhibitors to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins is highly desirable. However, challenges remain in precisely adjusting their conformation and stereochemistry to adapt the chiral regions of target proteins. Herein, using a stepwise programmable modular assembly approach, we precisely engineered two pairs of homochiral dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices (&#923;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#916;2R4&#8208;Hbpy, &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#923;2R4&#8208;Hbpy) functionalized with flexible dithiourea linkages. The resulting homochiral metallohelices exhibited significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities, and the enhanced structural compatibility of &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy with the target cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase&#8197;1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;104. Interestingly, emerging as a critical mediator in the development of oxaliplatin resistance, CDK1 targeting by &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy achieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis&#8208;mediated cell death in oxaliplatin&#8208;resistant HCT&#8208;8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality&#8208;selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.

         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New milling jars, made of epoxy resin doped with an organic dye, were manufactured to perform heat&#8208;controlled organic transformations upon NIR irradiation. Reactions that require external heat even under solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling conditions could then be performed efficiently.







Abstract
Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that gives access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850&#8197;nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.

         <title>Modulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Phenothiazine Dioxide via External Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
External halogen&#8208;&#960; interactions have been demonstrated to be a key feature for the development of ultralong phosphorescent material. A phenothiazine dioxide (DOPTZ) featuring a chloride atom linked through a flexible alkyl chain (DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl) exhibits an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime of 1351&#8197;ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1&#8201;%, the highest values among phenothiazine&#8208;based phosphorescent substances.







Abstract
Developing pure organic materials with ultralong lifetimes and balanced quantum efficiency is attractive but challenging. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to investigate external heavy atoms by linking molecular emitters with halogen through a flexible alkyl chain. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis clearly reveal the halogen C&#8722;X&#8208;&#960; interactions, which can be tuned by halogen donors, as well as the distance and geometry between them. Impressively, DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl featuring a chloride atom as donor, exhibits a balanced long phosphorescence lifetime of 1351&#8197;ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1&#8201;%. We also first demonstrate that Cl can induce more positive effect than heavier halogens (Br and I) on prolonging the lifetime. We envisage that the present study will expedite new molecular design to manipulate the room temperature phosphorescence via external heavy atom effect, and highlight a special C&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction for the development of ultralong phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in a Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A novel electrocatalytic strategy in composite solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (CPEs) is presented. By tuning the coupling strength between d and p orbitals of inorganic fillers, identified by the newly developed &#955; descriptor through density functional theory calculations and machine learning, the incorporation of titanium single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8 significantly promotes lithium salt dissociation and enhances CPEs&#8217; electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single&#8208;atom sites in metal&#8211;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF&#8208;8 matrix for PEO&#8208;based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO2, LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10&#8197;C with LiFePO4 cathodes and stable operation at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;A novel electrocatalytic strategy in composite solid-state polymer electrolytes (CPEs) is presented. By tuning the coupling strength between &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of inorganic fillers, identified by the newly developed &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; descriptor through density functional theory calculations and machine learning, the incorporation of titanium single atoms into ZIF-8 significantly promotes lithium salt dissociation and enhances CPEs&#8217; electrochemical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid-state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single-atom sites in metal&#8211;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium-ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;) via high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF-8 matrix for PEO-based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Mn0.05O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid-state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10&#8197;C with LiFePO4 cathodes and stable operation at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. These findings highlight the transformative potential of engineering &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization by incorporating single-atom sites into inorganic fillers for designing highly ion-conductive CPEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methylthio Substituent in SAM Constructing Regulatory Bridge with Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduced the MeS&#8208; substituent into SAM HTL materials, which enables stronger interactions with the buried perovskite interface, and offers better HOMO energy level alignment compared to the methoxy group. MeS&#8722;CbzPh based inverted perovskite photovoltaics achieved a champion efficiency of 26.01&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. Notably, the MeS&#8208; group demonstrated remarkable versatility. These findings present a novel strategy for designing new SAM materials to enhance the performance of inverted PSCs.







Abstract
Inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced remarkable advancements in recent years, which is largely attributed to the development of novel hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials. Methoxy (MeO&#8722;) groups are typically introduced into SAM materials to enhance their wettability and effectively passivate the perovskite buried interface. However, MeO&#8208;based SAM materials exhibit a mismatch in highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels with perovskite layer due to the strong electron&#8208;donating capability of methoxy group. In this work, we introduced a methylthio (MeS&#8722;) substituent that is superior to methoxy as a highly versatile self&#8208;assembled molecular design strategy. As a soft base, sulfur atom forms a stronger Pb&#8722;S bond than oxygen. Additionally, within the CbzPh series of SAM materials, MeS&#8722;CbzPh demonstrates a more optimal HOMO level and enhanced hole transport properties. Consequently, the MeS&#8722;CbzPh HTL based device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01&#8201;% and demonstrated high stability, retaining 93.3&#8201;% efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Moreover, in comparison with the commonly used 4PACz&#8208;based SAM molecular series, MeS&#8208;4PACz also exhibited the best performance among its peers. Our work provides valuable insights for the molecular design of SAM materials, offering a highly versatile functional substituent group.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Alkaline Water Splitting by Porous Macrocyclic Proton Sponges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superbasic aza&#8208;calixarene&#8208;based triamine (CalixNH2) with a tripyridinic core was designed to enhance alkaline HER by facilitating proton abstraction and water splitting. Porous polymers TpCalix and DhaCalix, synthesized using CalixNH2, showed distinct performance, with TpCalix achieving an overpotential of 112(&#177;2) mV for HER and 290(&#177;2) mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A two&#8208;electrode system using TpCalix operated at 1.73&#8197;V with 12&#8197;hours of stability.







Abstract
Macrocycles are unique as they encapsulate and transfer guest molecules or ions and facilitate catalytic processes. Although metalated macrocycles are pivotal in electrocatalytic processes, using metal&#8208;free analogs has been rare. Following the strategy of Kanbara et&#8197;al., we synthesized an azacalixarene macrocycle&#8208;N, N&#8217;, N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tris(p&#8208;aminophenyl)azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine (CalixNH2). The macrocycle encapsulates a proton in its cavity, maintaining the protonation even in highly alkaline media. Notably, it retains almost 50&#8201;% protonated form in 1&#8197;M KOH (~pH&#8197;14)&#8208;acting as a proton sponge. As hydrogen evolution is complex in alkaline media owing to sluggish water dissociation, we implemented the proton sponge (CalixNH2) in an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Conjugated Porous polymers, TpCalix and DhaCalix, have been synthesized from the triamine&#8208;CalixNH2. The most efficient catalyst, TpCalix, has shown excellent performance in alkaline HER and OER in 1&#8197;M KOH (~pH&#8197;14), with low overpotentials of only 112(&#177;2) and 290(&#177;2) mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and durable up to 24&#8197;hours. A full&#8208;cell reaction using TpCalix in both the cathode and anode exhibited a low full&#8208;cell voltage of 1.73&#8197;V and was stable for 12&#8197;hours. DFT calculations verified the tripyridinic core, which acts as the principal site for proton abstraction and binding.

         <title>Stimulating the Potential of Zn Anodes to Operate in Low pH and Harsh Environments forHighly Sustainable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy for Zn anodes using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers to enable stable operation in acidic electrolytes (pH = 2.2). This approach achieves over 3,600 hours of stable Zn stripping/plating and enables Zn||Mn batteries to operate with high voltage output. Notably, seawater&#8208;based pouch cells demonstrate a practical energy density of 57.4 Wh/kg, highlighting seawater&#8242;s potential as an economical electrolyte solvent for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Compared to near&#8208;neutral electrolytes (pH=3&#8211;6), Zn||Mn batteries in acidic environments can achieve voltages up to ~2&#8197;V. However, high proton concentrations raise concerns about Zn anode stability. Current strategies for inhibiting hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) on the anode in Zn&#8208;based batteries mainly focus on the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. To supplement this gap, we developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers for Zn anodes to demonstrate the potential of Zn anode to operate in acidic electrolytes. This approach enables stable Zn stripping/plating at pH=2.2 for over 3,600&#8197;h and 400&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Benefiting from stable Zn electrodes, the electrolytic Zn||Mn batteries can operate at 1.90&#8197;V. To show more harsh scenarios, the seawater&#8208;based 0.25&#8197;Ah&#8208;scale Zn||Mn pouch cells can be assembled with a practical energy density of 57.4&#8197;Wh&#8201; kg&#8208;1 cell. Significantly, we analyze and emphasize that seawater holds promise as an alternative to deionized water for electrolyte solvents due to its energy and economic effectiveness. This strategy has motivated to expand the working pH range of metal anodes and provides the rational design for grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies.

         <title>Microbe Engineering to Provide Drimane&#8208;Type Building Blocks for Chiral Pool Synthesis of Meroterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational engineering of PhoN and the incorporation of a Nudix hydrolase, an optimized PhoN&#8208;IPK system was developed, enabling the efficient production of drimane&#8208;type building blocks of drimenol (398&#8197;mg/L) and albicanol (3.5&#8197;g/L). Albicanol, serving as a versatile chiral pool precursor, facilitated the direct and concise synthesis of a variety of drimane&#8208;type merosesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type merosesquiterpenoids (DMT) are a class of natural products with diverse structures and broad biological activity. Classical DMT synthesis relies on atom&#8208;inefficient plant&#8208;derived chiral pool building blocks, while alternative drimane&#8208;type building blocks such as drimenol and albicanol offer more direct routes but face production challenges. In this study, we engineered a microbial platform for efficient production of these building blocks. By optimizing the PhoN&#8208;IPK system through rational engineering and incorporating a Nudix hydrolase, we achieved a drimenol production of 398&#8197;mg/L and high albicanol titers of 1805&#8197;mg/L in shake flasks and 3.5&#8197;g/L in a bioreactor. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of the engineered PhoN provided insights into its improved catalytic efficiency. We demonstrated the utility of this platform by synthesizing several DMT using albicanol as the starting material, reducing the number of synthetic steps and improving overall efficiency as compared to classical approaches.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Tailored EDL Induced Triple&#8208;Layer SEI on High&#8208;Capacity Anodes Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Durable Sodium&#8208;Storage</title>

A dense thin triple&#8208;layer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (inner: Se, mediate: inorganic, outer: organic) is formed on Se&#8208;FeS2 anode via Sex2&#8722; anion&#8208;tailored electric double layer in NaCF3SO3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures lower ion transport barrier and greatly suppresses the electrolyte substantial consumption. The Se&#8208;FeS2 enables high reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycling life at fast&#8208;charging mode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity electrodes face a great challenge of cycling stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained electrolyte decomposition for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, Se&#8208;solubility induced Sex2&#8722; as self&#8208;adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing novel triple&#8208;layer SEI (inner layer: Se; mediate layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high&#8208;capacity FeS2 anode as an example for achieving stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Sex2&#8722; in situ generated at 1.30&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na) and was preferentially adsorbed onto EDL of anode, then converted to Se0 as inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Sex2&#8722; causes anion&#8208;enhanced Na+ solvation structure could produce more inorganic (Se0, NaF) and less organic SEI components. The unique triple&#8208;layer SEI with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long&#8208;lifespan at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (383.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, 6000&#8197;cycles, 93.1&#8201;%, 5&#8197;min/cycle). The Se&#8208;induced triple&#8208;layer SEI could be also be formed on high&#8208;capacity SnS2 anode. This work provides a novel SEI model by anion&#8208;tailored EDL towards stable sodium&#8208;storage of high&#8208;capacity anode for fast&#8208;charging.

         <title>Access to Polyhydroxyalkanoates with Diverse Syndiotacticity via Polymerization by Spiro&#8208;Salen Complexes and Insights into the Stereocontrol Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiro&#8208;salen catalytic system allows to establish a versatile platform of stereoregular PHA polymers with tunable thermal and mechanical properties which are comparable to commodity plastics. A combined experimental and computational study suggests a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted broad interest as promising sustainable materials to address plastic pollution and resource scarcity. However, the chemical synthesis of stereoregular PHAs via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) has long been an elusive endeavor. In this contribution, we exploited a robust spiro&#8208;salen yttrium complex (Y3) as the catalyst to successfully prepare syndiotactic PHAs with diverse pendent groups. Simply altering the ratio of enantiomeric catalysts allowed to access of PHAs with diverse syndiotacticity (Pr=0.5&#8211;0.99, from sticky oil to tough materials), delivering tunable thermal properties (glass transition temperature, Tg from &#8722;52 to 70&#8201;&#176;C and melting transition temperature, Tm from 38 to 223&#8201;&#176;C). A combined experimental and computational study suggested a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.

         <title>Sulfurized Composite Interphase Enables a Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+.







Abstract
The stability and reversibility of Zn anode can be greatly improved by in situ construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface via a low&#8208;cost design strategy of ZnSO4 electrolyte. However, the role of hydrogen bond acceptor &#8208;SO3 accompanying ZnS formation during SEI reconstruction is overlooked. In this work, we have explored and revealed the new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) on Zn anode electrochemistry in ZnSO4 aqueous electrolytes. Structure characterization and DFT demonstrate that the introduction of &#8208;SO3 can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Owing to the synergistic effect of ZnS and &#8208;SO3, a high cycling stability of 1500&#8197;h with a cumulative&#8208;plated capacity of 7.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved within the symmetrical cell. Furthermore, the full cell with NH4V4O10 cathode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 100&#8201;%. These new insights into anionic synergistic strategy could significantly enhance the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8722;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a chemical transformation that exploits the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction catalytically is presented. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silylating reagents, various (hetero)aryl bromides have been converted to the corresponding organosilicon compounds using inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters. Mechanistic studies point to the involvement of tert&#8208;butylsodium (tBuNa) that mediates the key Na/Br exchange event.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8722;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8722;Br metalating agent.

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of the Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom site can be tuned by preferentially removing the pyrrolic nitrogen over the pyridinic nitrogen, resulting in a shorter Fe&#8722;N to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, and promoting an in&#8208;plane oxygen reconstruction to lower the energy barrier in the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalyst with the modified Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom sites exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis in a Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C with shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds also favors the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~720&#8197;h of continuous cycling.

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Axially Chiral Sulfilimines Enabled by Anionic Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
An adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis is established for the enantioselective S&#8208;arylation of sulfenamides, precisely accessing various multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines with excellent efficiencies and selectivity (67 examples, 12 possible isomers, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The S&#8208;arylation/pyramidal inversion sequence enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines.







Abstract
An efficient enantioselective coupling reaction between sulfenamides and cyclic diaryliodonium salts is established via adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis, precisely synthesizing a broad range of axially chiral sulfilimines with excellent enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and chemoselectivities (67 examples under same conditions, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The following thermodynamically controlled pyramidal inversion enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers. Mechanistic studies suggest that anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complexes serve as counteranions of diaryliodonium and anionic ligand of Cu(I) catalyst simultaneously, which could be regarded as an explanation for outstanding selectivities.

         <title>Improving the Cellular Internalization of Zr(IV) Nanocages by Tuning Hydrophilicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating the ligand of a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage with a Ru(II) complex was found to not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Additionally, butyl modifications on the cyclopentadienyl anion rings of the Zr&#8722;O clusters fine&#8208;tuned the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the nanocages, thereby achieving outstanding live&#8208;cell imaging capabilities.







Abstract
Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well&#8208;defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Notably, butyl&#8208;modification of the cyclopentadiene rings can significantly enhance the cell uptake (100&#8197;folds) of nanocages via actin&#8208; and dynamin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The unique advantages and easy modifiability of these nanocages make them highly promising candidates for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Iridium Single Atom Catalyst in a Porous Organic Polymer for Glycerol Conversion to Lactic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) are a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, combining the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with high active metal site dispersion. A novel, stable Iridium (Ir) SAC catalyst synthesized by directly incorporating an active Ir complex within a porous organic polymer matrix exhibits exceptional efficiency and selectivity in converting glycerol to lactic acid.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) are a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, combining the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with high active metal site dispersion. A novel, stable Iridium (Ir) SAC catalyst synthesized by directly incorporating an active Ir complex within a porous organic polymer matrix exhibits exceptional efficiency and selectivity in converting glycerol to lactic acid.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorescence Behavior of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes from the Perspective of Excited State Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes has been synthesized. The doped PMMA films demonstrate a light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence phenomenon. Our research reveals that these complexes exhibit a long phosphorescence lifetime, a high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate, and significant phosphorescence intensity. These three characteristics enable the phosphorescence of the CMA complex&#8208;doped films to be activated by light, allowing for a change in the emission color of the films.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have diverse applications in luminescence, imaging and sensing. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of CMA complexes, which were subsequently doped into a PMMA host. These materials demonstrate light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence, attributed to their long intrinsic triplet state lifetime (&#964;P,int, in the &#956;s&#8208;ms scale), high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant (kISC, up to 107&#8197;s&#8722;1), and bright phosphorescence. The extended &#964;P,int, and elevated kISC facilitate efficient sensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is rapidly consumed by the host material, creating a localized anaerobic environment conducive to bright phosphorescence emission. The Sn&#8208;T1 process exhibits a large spin&#8208;orbital coupling matrix element (SOCME) value, while the SOCME value between T1 and S0 is comparatively smaller, resulting in a large kISC and long &#964;P,int, Computational results indicate that the hole&#8208;electron configuration in the lowest triplet state exhibits low contributions from gold. Based on the dynamic phosphorescence properties, an encryption material capable of achieving a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; effect was developed. This work illustrates that those phosphorescent emitters with minimal heavy atom contribution can produce dynamic phosphorescent phenomena, providing a novel strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Photoregulated Supramolecular Polymerization through Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) interactions as a reversible network element to control the communication between stimuli&#8208;responses and self&#8208;assembly. This approach broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli&#8208;responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a two&#8208;component system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media (OPE&#8208;Py) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [(E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I]. OPE&#8208;Py self&#8208;assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co&#8208;assembly with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if OPE&#8208;Py is treated with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber&#8208;like morphology of OPE&#8208;Py. Thus, breaking the communication between self&#8208;assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Program&#8208;Modulated Kinetics of Perovskite&#8208;Film Growth by Molecular &#8220;Thruster&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;, a hypervalent iodine (III) compound, was used to programmatically modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth. This molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221; features three carbonyl groups and C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond, which endows its strongly coordination and dissociation abilities, thus programmatically regulating perovskite film growth by retarding the reaction between FAI and PbI2, promoting solvent volatilization, and passivating the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film exhibits high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and significantly reduced defects. As a result, the pero&#8208;SCs simultaneously achieved outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent operational stability.







Abstract
The rapid reaction between lead iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) films. Conventional methods, such as using nonvolatile small molecular additives to slow the reaction, often result in buried interfacial voids and molecule diffusion, compromising the devices&#8217; operational stability. In this study, we introduced a molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;&#8212;a hypervalent iodine (III) compound with three carbonyl groups and a C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond&#8212;that possesses coordination and dissociation abilities, enabling programed modulation of perovskite&#8208;film growth kinetics. Initially, the three carbonyl groups coordinate with PbI2 to slow the reaction between FAI and PbI2, preventing &#948;&#8208;phase formation. As temperature rises, the C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond dissociates, promoting perovskite growth and the dissociated product iodobenzene will promote solvent volatilization, thus avoiding buried interfacial voids. Another product, a carbene compound with eight lone pair electrons sufficiently passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and anchors at grain boundaries without diffusion. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film displays high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and reduced defects. Evidently, 0.062&#8208; and 1.004&#8208;cm2 pero&#8208;SCs achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 26.06&#8201;% (25.79&#8201;% certified) and 24.65&#8201;%, respectively. This approach also controls perovskite&#8208;film growth on plastic substrates, resulting in flexible pero&#8208;SCs with an impressive PCE of 25.12&#8201;%.

Based on the suppression principle, PD with both electron and proton affinity can simultaneously suppress H2O activity and enhance interface stability. Specifically, the proton affinity could break H2O&#8208;rich hydrogen bond network to terminate proton transport in bulk electrolyte, and electron affinity guaranteed the competitive chemistry with H2O molecules to enable stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface for aqueous zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network in aqueous electrolytes can lead to uncontrollable hydrogen transfer, and combining the interfacial parasitic electron consumption cause the side reaction in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, hydrogen/electron amphiphilic bi&#8208;functional 1,5&#8208;Pentanediol (PD) molecule was introduced to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Stronger proton affinity of &#8208;OH in PD can break bulk&#8208;H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network to inhibit the activity of water, and electron affinity can enhance electron acceptation capability, which ensures that PD is preferentially bound to electrode material over H2O. Besides, the participation of PD in the Zn2+ solvation structure reduces water content at the solid&#8211;liquid interface and promotes uniform deposition process by optimizing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation energy. Accordingly, dense and vertical zinc texture based on intrinsic steric hindrance effect of PD and formed SEI protective layer to induce stable Zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, an organic&#8211;inorganic shielding water layer was formed at the cathode side to suppress vanadium dissolution in vanadium Oxide. Consequently, Zn//Zn symmetric cell could cycle for more than 5600&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 250&#8197;hours at 50&#8201;&#176;C). Besides, the VO2 and I2 cathode all achieved stable cycling performance and former pouch cell could reach average capacity of 0.13 Ah.

         <title>Engineered Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Responsive Artificial H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels for Targeted Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels are developed. ROS trigger the rapid release of the channel forming units, which self&#8208;assemble into stable H&#8208;bonded transmembrane cascades, facilitating efficient H+/Cl&#8722; co&#8208;transport. ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and demonstrates exceptional selectivity over normal cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ion channels regulate the ion flow across the membranes in response to alterations in the cellular redox state, playing a crucial role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. Despite their significance, replicating ROS&#8208;responsive functionality in artificial ion channels remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel class of artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels activatable by elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. ROS&#8208;induced decaging of the phenylboronate group triggers the rapid release of the channel&#8208;forming units, leading to self&#8208;assembly of the H&#8208;bonded cascades facilitating the synergistic transport of H+ and Cl&#8722; ions, with H+/Cl&#8722; ion transport selectivity of 7.7. Upon activation, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant apoptotic activity against human breast cancer cells, achieving an IC50 of 2.8&#8197;&#956;M, comparable to that of paclitaxel. Exploiting the intrinsic oxidative microenvironment of cancer cells, along with the enhanced oxidative stress arising from H+/Cl&#8722; co&#8208;transport, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl demonstrates exceptional selectivity in targeting cancer cells with a selectivity index of 10.2 over normal breast cells, outperforming that of paclitaxel by 19.4 folds.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Springe Enriched Hierarchical Porous MOP/COF Hybrid Aerogel: Efficient Recovery of Gold from Electronic Waste</title>

A solution&#8208;processable zirconium metal based Metal&#8208;organic Polyhedra threaded chemically stable Covalent Organic Framework has been fabricated at ambient condition in the form of a crystalline hybrid hierarchically aerogel for selective recovery of gold from e&#8208;waste.







Abstract
Extraction of gold from secondary resources such as electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) has become crucial in recent times to compensate for the gradual scarcity of the noble metal in natural mines. However, designing and synthesizing a suitable material for highly efficient gold recovery is still a great challenge. Herein, we have strategically designed rapid fabrication of an ionic crystalline hybrid aerogel by covalent threading of an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic polyhedra with an imine&#8208;linked chemically stable covalent organic framework at ambient condition. The hierarchically porous ultra&#8208;light aerogel featuring imine&#8208;rich backbone, high surface area, and cationic sites have shown fast removal, high uptake capacity (2349&#8197;mg/g), and excellent selectivity towards gold sequestration. Besides, the aerogel can extract ultra&#8208;trace gold&#8208;ions from different terrestrial water bodies, aiming towards safe drinking water. This study demonstrates the great potential of the composite materials based on a novel approach to designing a hybrid porous material for efficient gold recovery from complex water matrices.

         <dc:description>
Connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene, through an acetylene bridge has been shown to increase the cumulene character in one&#8208;dimensional acetylene&#8208;based conjugates. Spectroscopic analysis and calculations indicate significant &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization during the low temperature&#8208;promoted planarization of the conjugates, which in turn enhances the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge.







Abstract
Acetylene/polyynes &#8722;(C&#8801;C&#8722;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.

This work affords an efficient approach to promote PHE by both strengthening the driving force at dye/PCN interface and stabilizing excited triplet states of organic dyes by rational modulation of molecular structures and aggregated behaviors. The IEF strength increased by the adjustable substitution positions of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A moieties from p&#8208; to o&#8208;substitution, and the lifetimes of excited triplet states were prolonged by the alkyl chain engineering.







Abstract
The heterojunction photocatalysts composed of organic dyes and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) have great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). However, serious charge recombination exists at the dye/PCN interface for the large gaps in time scales and the poor driving force of charge transfer process. Herein, both the excited triplet states of organic dyes with long lifetimes and strong internal electric fields (IEF) as charge transfer driving forces are achieved by the construction of high dipole moments with aromatic&#8208;core engineering, and modulation of dye aggregates by alkyl modification. Accordingly, PHE efficiency can achieve up to 833.49&#8197;&#956;mol/h, over 36&#8208;fold that of PCN/Pt (23.34&#8197;&#956;mol/h) under the same conditions. The relationship between molecular structures and PHE performance has been systematically investigated by the photophysical properties of organic dyes and the strength of IEF at dye/PCN interface. It afforded an efficient strategy to balance the charge transfer process in PHE systems, which can guide the molecular design of organic dyes with optimized aggregated behaviors and stable excited triplet states.

         <title>Reactive Intermediate Confinement in Beta Zeolites for the Efficient Aerobic Epoxidation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Mukaiyama epoxidation reaction, the channels of Beta zeolite can restrict the formation of undesired intermediates and only accomodate the epoxidation intermediate, thereby enhancing the selectivity of the epoxidation reaction and coupling effiency of aldehyde.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of long&#8208;chain linear &#945;&#8208;olefins (LAOs) into industrially useful epoxides is of pivotal importance. Mukaiyama epoxidation based on the use of molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant and aldehyde as the cosubstrate offers a promising route for LAOs epoxidation. However, challenges associated with epoxide forming selectivity and aldehyde coupling efficiency have long impeded the adoption of Mukaiyama epoxidation in large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, we show that confinement of key intermediates involved in the parallel epoxidation pathways within a Beta zeolite unlocks a selectivity of greater than 95&#8201;% towards the epoxides at the expense of minimal consumption of only 1.5&#8197;equivalents of the aldehyde, achieving an efficiency better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn sites into the Beta zeolite framework further facilitates the adsorption activation process of the aldehyde cosubstrate, thereby increasing the concentration of acylperoxy radicals and accelerating the kinetic process of the epoxidation step. Consequently, this work not only provides an efficient and green epoxidation route over zeolite catalysts with easily available O2 as the oxidant, but also systematically reveals the fundamental understanding of the zeolite confinement effects on steering the reaction pathway, which benefits the further development of valorization of LAOs.

         <title>Restraining Planar Gliding in Single&#8208;Crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 Cathodes by Combining Bulk and Surface Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bulk and surface modification strategy is devised for developing single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 cathode particles with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties. Specifically, stabilizing MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are introduced into the bulk lattice, while a Mg3(BO3)2 protective layer is concurrently formed on the surface.







Abstract
The delamination cracking from planar gliding along the (003) facets and anisotropic lattice strain perpendicular to the (003) facets inevitable lead to degradation of Ni&#8208;rich single&#8208;crystal cathode materials, adversely affecting their cyclability. Herein, we rationally design a single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (SC90) cathode with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties, in which coherently grown MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are incorporated into the lattice, and a stabilizing Mg3(BO3)2 layer is concurrently formed on the particle surface. Multiscale in/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that introducing the MgO6 and BO4 units leads to a &#8220;pinning effect&#8221; within the layered structure. This in turn strongly mitigates mechanical degradation by reducing planar gliding and delamination cracking over extended cycling. Moreover, the Mg3(BO3)2 coating maintains fast lithium diffusion by suppressing parasitic reactions at the cathode|electrolyte interface. The tailored SC90 cathode exhibits a capacity retention of ~88&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 5&#8197;C rate, significantly outperforming the pristine counterpart (~60&#8201;%). Additionally, a pouch&#8208;type full cell with a graphite anode sustains a specific discharge capacity of 177&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles, with 90&#8201;% capacity retention. This work highlights the &#8220;pining effect&#8221; in preventing unfavorable slab sliding and structural deterioration, offering new insights for designing advanced ultrahigh Ni single&#8208;crystal cathodes.

Selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue (SeNB) derivatives enable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;activated proximity labeling of biomolecules via a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mediated pathway in the presence of propargylamine. SeNB core efficiently generates 1O2 in lipid&#8208;rich environments while the tailored tail structures allow for selective targeting of different organelle membranes. This strategic combination achieves wash&#8208;free proximity labeling, bypassing genetic manipulation and compatible with multiple cell lines.







Abstract
Elucidating the subcellular localization of RNAs and proteins is fundamental to understanding their biological functions. Genetically encoded proteins/enzymes provide an attractive approach to target many proteins of interest, but are limited to specific cell lines. Although small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based methods have been explored, a comprehensive system for profiling multiple locations in living cells, comparable to fusion&#8208;protein techniques, is yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a novel proximity labeling strategy employing a suite of small molecules derived from benzo&#8208;phenoselenazine (e.g., selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue [SeNB]), which achieves proximity labeling through singlet oxygen generation upon near&#8208;infrared light activation in the presence of propargylamine. These SeNB compounds allow for selective labeling of RNAs and proteins within living cells, exhibiting a distinct preference for organelle membranes, which are systematically investigated via in vitro, computational, and in cellulo examinations. Our findings highlight the capabilities of SeNB derivatives as wash&#8208;free and genetics&#8208;free approaches to illuminate the subcellular localization of biological molecules with deep penetration and high spatial resolution. Moreover, SeNB derivatives are capable of elucidating inter&#8208;organelle interactions at the molecular level, as evidenced by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, thus holding significant potential for advancing our understanding of cellular processes related to disease progression and therapeutic development.

         <title>Depth&#8208;of&#8208;Discharge Dependent Capacity Decay Induced by the Accumulation of Oxidized Lattice Oxygen in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>

The rapid capacity decay mechanism of LRLO during LDOD cycling is elucidated. The accumulation of activated On&#8722; and persistent vacancy&#8208;rich state intensified TM in&#8208;plane migration, leading to the vacancies transition from separated to aggregated states, facilitating detrimental out&#8208;of&#8208;plane TM migration. Furthermore, increased anionic redox reactions resulted in cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode shuttle of On&#8722; and by&#8208;products, leading to lithium loss.







Abstract

     alt="Depth-of-Discharge Dependent Capacity Decay Induced by the Accumulation of Oxidized Lattice Oxygen in Li-Rich Layered Oxide Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid capacity decay mechanism of LRLO during LDOD cycling is elucidated. The accumulation of activated O&lt;sup&gt;n&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and persistent vacancy-rich state intensified TM in-plane migration, leading to the vacancies transition from separated to aggregated states, facilitating detrimental out-of-plane TM migration. Furthermore, increased anionic redox reactions resulted in cathode-to-anode shuttle of O&lt;sup&gt;n&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and by-products, leading to lithium loss.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;Substitution in Red&#8208;Emitting Phosphor Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ for Advanced Spectroscopic Applications Including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;High Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>

This work successfully introduced [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution into the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ lattice. The co&#8208;substitution was verified to enhance the lattice rigidity so as to notably raise the external quantum efficiency. Under blue laser excitation, the phosphor has an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2. Under high pressure, the phosphor has an optimal pressure sensitivity of 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa.







Abstract
In order to obtain novel and more efficient red light&#8208;emitting materials, a series of Sr2[Mg1&#8722;xLixAl5&#8722;xSixN7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and successfully synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8722;Al]5+ by [Li&#8722;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated in detail. A series of powder XRD data and Rietveld refinement indicate that [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution can successfully enter the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice. With the entry of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ into the lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ leads to the weakening of the nephelauxetic effect of the 5d level of Eu2+, which shifts the emission peak from 657&#8197;nm to 647&#8197;nm and reduces the excitation in the green region, i.e., lowers the absorption of green light. When the amount of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency (EQE), reflecting the luminescence intensity, is elevated by 49.6&#8201;%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2, which is remarkably superior to other existing red phosphors, a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. Cathodoluminescence (CL) characterization and measurements attest to the favorable CL properties of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650&#8197;nm to 702&#8197;nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.

         <title>Engineering of HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 Active Sites in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Enhanced (Photo)Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective ligand removal strategy was developed to engineer active catalytic sites of unsaturated HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, which significantly accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction by reducing the overpotential water adsorption from 0.31&#8197;V to 0.07&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Currently, lack of ways to engineer specific and well&#8208;defined active sites in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) limits our fundamental knowledge with respect to the mechanistic details for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we introduce the open metal sites into ZIFs through the selective ligand removal (SeLiRe) strategy, comprehensively characterize the altered structural and electronic features, and evaluate their role in HER. In situ electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of high&#8208;valence HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 sites through the binding of Zn&#8722;N2 with electrolyte hydroxide. The optimal OMS&#8208;ZIF exhibits a low overpotential of 0.41&#8197;V to achieve an ampere&#8208;level 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 120&#8208;hour stability. Theoretical simulations indicate that these active sites accelerate the water molecules activation kinetics, consequently enhancing the efficiency of the Volmer step. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy to introduce highly active catalytic sites in ZIFs, providing new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism in alkaline media.

         <title>H Induced Metal&#8208;Insulation Transition Boosts the Stability of High Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The frequent start&#8208;up and shut&#8208;down (SU/SD) caused fuel starvation operation condition seriously deteriorates the performance and lifetime of the fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). We proposed the temperature&#8208;matched hydrogen&#8208;induced metal&#8208;insulator phase transition for controlling activity and fuel starvation tolerance in HT&#8208;PEMFCs.







Abstract
High temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) have garnered significant attention due to their expanded range of hydrogen sources and simplified management systems. However, the frequent start&#8208;up and shut&#8208;down (SU/SD) caused fuel starvation operation condition seriously deteriorates the performance and lifetime of the fuel cell. In this manuscript, VO2 was incorporated in the anode to restrain fuel starvation of the electrode. Under the operation condition, the insulative VO2 would reversibly transform into metallic HxVO2 by intercalating hydrogen, and HxVO2 can automatically release hydrogen, which could act as the hydrogen buffer and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. After the hydrogen release, the generated insulating VO2 would prevent the side reactions during fuel starvation. Compared to the traditional Pt anode, the electrode with VO2 showed much higher output power and greatly improved durability after fuel starvation. This work demonstrates the in situ reversible hydrogen storage/release&#8208;controlled metal&#8208;insulator phase transition strategy to enhance the durability of fuel cells.

         <title>Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational coupling of aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a micelle platform enables spatiotemporally controlled, simultaneous release of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) under clinically relevant wavelengths. This intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO synergistically induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell apoptosis, offering significant potential for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Understanding the interplay between gasotransmitters is essential for unlocking their therapeutic potential. However, achieving spatiotemporally controlled co&#8208;delivery to target cells remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy for the intracellular co&#8208;delivery of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitters under clinically relevant wavelengths. This approach rationally couples aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a polymeric micelle platform, using palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) as both photosensitizer and photocatalyst. Notably, the photooxidation&#8208;mediated release of CO generates a local hypoxic microenvironment, which facilitates the photoredox catalyzed release of NO. This self&#8208;adaptive micelle platform enables efficient uptake by tumor cells and intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO under 630&#8197;nm light irradiation, demonstrating potent anti&#8208;tumor activity in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model via the synergistic induction of mitochondrial apoptosis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Arenes with Varied Linker Lengths: Bridging Catalytic Selectivity with Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and versatile rhodium&#8208;catalytic system has been developed to achieve selective arylation of arenes at the meta position with high regiocontrol, even on substrates that exhibit significant flexibility between the arene and the directing group. The total synthesis of SHP2 inhibitor CNBCA validates the synthetic utility of this methodology, particularly in contexts where flexible access to the meta position of an aromatic ring is required.







Abstract
The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted approach has so far been the major route to achieve selective C&#8722;H activation at both proximal and distal positions. While rhodium catalysts are highly effective in DG&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation, meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation with rhodium has not yet been reported. In this study, we present the first example of Rh&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. We found that the 2&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;based directing group, in conjunction with arylboronic acids, selectively promotes meta&#8208;arylation with complete mono&#8208;selectivity. Despite significant advancements in meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation for substrates with shorter linkers, such as hydrocinnamic acids, benzyl alcohols/amines, etc., meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation of substrates with longer alkyl chains remains challenging with limited literature examples. We demonstrated that arenes with varying chain lengths, including conformationally flexible and less rigid ones such as 4&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, 5&#8208;phenylvaleric acid, 6&#8208;phenylcaproic acid, 3&#8208;phenylpropanol, and 4&#8208;phenylbutanol underwent meta&#8208;arylation with high levels of regiocontrol. From a synthetic perspective, this approach could be valuable as it allows to produce biaryl derivatives of flexible arenes with native functional groups at the meta&#8208;position. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the total synthesis of CNBCA, a bioactive compound possessing promising potency against the SHP2 enzyme activity in vitro.

         <title>IrPdCuFeNiCoMo Based Core&#8208;Shell Icosahedron Nanocrystals and Nanocages for Efficient and Robust Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured icosahedron nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy shell were deliberately designed and synthesized and sequential chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy nanocages, which show robust performance towards acidic oxygen evolution reaction, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable over 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Facets engineering of high entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals might be achieved via shape&#8208;controlled synthesis, which is promising but remains challenging in designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts towards efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Herein, icosahedra nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo shell were prepared by wet&#8208;chemical reduction in one&#8208;pot, ascribing to the initial formation PdCu core and subsequent deposition and diffusion of IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA shell. Sequential selective chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA nanocages, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 51.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and 1624&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.50&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in a conventional three electrode cell. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it delivers a low cell voltage of 1.65 and 1.77&#8197;V at a current density of 1.0 and 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and maintains stable over 900&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations attribute the enhanced intrinsic activity to the broad distribution of the binding energy for OER intermediates on IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA, which breaks the linear scaling relationship and accelerates the OER process.

         <title>Organic Crosslinked Tin Oxide Mitigating Buried Interface Defects for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The gelation&#8208;promoting effect of BPS causes SnO2 to gel faster, resulting in a better intermediate state during the gelation and annealing crystallization processes, achieving a slightly larger and more uniform electron transport layer and an orderly perovskite layer.







Abstract
Tin dioxide (SnO2) stands as a promising material for the electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attributed to its superlative optoelectronic properties. The attainment of superior power conversion efficiency hinges critically on the preparation of high&#8208;quality SnO2 thin films. However, conventional nanoparticle SnO2 colloids often suffer from inherent issues such as numerous oxygen vacancy defects and film non&#8208;uniformity. In this study, we report a strategy to homogenize SnO2 with reduced defects for high&#8208;performance PSCs. The commercial SnO2 colloid is modulated with bisphenol S (BPS) crosslinking to achieve a better annealing intermediate state. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on BPS bond with the hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface, passivating defects as well as promoting superb regularity of the films by forming a network of the SnO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, the sulfone groups on BPS coordinate with Pb2+, regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and FAPbI3, which leads to better interface contact at the buried interface. The FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells based on BPS&#8208;crosslinked SnO2 layers achieved a champion efficiency of 24.87&#8201;% and retained 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 1000&#8197;hours of continuous light soaking under N2 atmosphere.

         <title>A De Novo Auto&#8208;Activated Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrid System for Hydrogen Production in Methanotrophic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative biohybrid systems are created for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) production through the integration of engineered methanotrophic bacteria with thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+), exhibiting improved production activity, selectivity, and stability. Notably, the sacrificial agent is self&#8208;regenerated from methane, facilitating sustainable system activation and sustaining the electron flow cycle necessary for both H2 biosynthesis and methane oxidation. This provides a new approach to developing biohybrid system and upcycling greenhouse gases.







Abstract
Climate change driving by greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum&#8208;based energy has garnered significant attention. Renewable energy production via a sustainable system that integrates the cell factory and visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysts offers a novel approach for upcycling methane and addressing global energy challenges. Here, an auto&#8208;activated biohybrid system driven by solar energy is developed for converting methane into hydrogen fuel, which incorporated thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+) and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria. In this system, S&#8208;MV2+ functioned as photosensitizer and electron mediator, capturing solar energy and supplying electrons for an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed bioprocess. The genetically modified Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 mutant, lacking methanol dehydrogenase but overexpressing hydrogenase, is able to convert methane into methanol that maintains the electron flow cycle by quenching photogenerated holes for both hydrogen biosynthesis and methane oxidation. Finally, the highest H2 production of 272.96&#8197;&#956;M from this biohybrid system was achieved with methanol as a sacrificial agent generated by the H2&#8208;producing mutant, resulting in a 140&#8208;fold enhancement. This innovative method showcases the potential of coupling photocatalysis with methanotrophic biocatalysis for sustainable energy production. Additionally, the system introduces a new strategy for self&#8208;regeneration of sacrificial agents, offering a promising avenue for hydrogen production using greenhouse gases in an eco&#8208;friendly manner.

         <title>Polyglycidamides: from Backbone&#8208;Promoted Amidation to Degradable Polyether with Wide&#8208;Range LCST</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy&#8208;selective ring&#8208;opening polymerization of ethyl glycidate is achieved organocatalytically. The pendant ester groups of resulting ester&#8208;functionalized polyether can be easily co&#8208;amidated by two different amines at 0&#8201;&#176;C with ethylene glycol as a catalyst, generating amide&#8208;functionalized polyethers with tunable LCST and degradability.







Abstract
Amide groups occur extensively in natural and synthetic polymers cultivating their vital roles in biological and industrial worlds. We report here an efficient and controlled pathway to amide&#8208;functionalized polyethers through ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of commercially available ethyl glycidate followed by amidation of the pendant ester groups. Transesterification is inhibited during the ROP by use of a two&#8208;component organocatalyst. Surprisingly, amidation can be completed even at 0&#8201;&#176;C uncatalyzed, which is attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the oxygenated backbone as well as the inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding. Also interestingly, ethylene glycol and water are found to further accelerate the amidation while suppressing backbone degradation. The obtained polyglycidamides (PGAms) exhibit aqueous thermoresponsive properties, similar to their carbon&#8208;chain counterparts (polyacrylamides). Cloud point can be linearly modulated by co&#8208;amidation using two amines of varied ratios. Unlike polyacrylamides and regular polyethers, PGAm is degradable through retro&#8208;oxa&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.

         <title>Mechanochromic Organic Micro&#8208;Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic laser material has been shown to be capable of simultaneously exhibiting amplified spontaneous emission and mechanofluorochromic properties under a wide range of shear and normal force conditions. Applying a localized mechanical pressure as low as 0.1&#8197;MPa inhibits the micro&#8208;laser behavior at the given spot, while a hydrostatic pressure of 1 to 2&#8197;GPa leads to a narrow emission and a pressure&#8208;dependent shift in the emission wavelength.







Abstract
This work presents the first demonstration of a mechanochromic organic micro&#8208;laser, which exhibits remarkable wide range pressure sensing characteristics. The gain material, pinacolato boronate ester functionalized anthanthrene (AnBPin), is designed by incorporating mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties into organic laser dye. The AnBPin exhibits a reversible transition between green and orange fluorescence upon grinding annealing and recrystallization cycle, and its micro&#8208;crystal exhibits typical organic micro&#8208;laser behaviors. Applying localized mechanical pressure as low as 0.1&#8197;MPa inhibits micro&#8208;laser behavior at the given spot. In contrast, under 1 to 2&#8197;GPa hydrostatic pressure, the organic laser maintains narrow emission while showing a pressure&#8208;dependent shift in emission wavelength. By combining theory and experimentation, we attribute the unusual pressure&#8208;correlated emission spectroscopy to the unique interleaved locked crystal structure. Understanding the mechanochromic laser behavior in AnBPin micro&#8208;crystals under an unprecedented pressure range significantly expands the family of organic micro&#8208;lasers and provides a new route for wide&#8208;range photonic pressure detection.

         <title>Engineering the Self&#8208;Assembly Pathways of POSS&#8208;Peptide Amphiphiles to Form Diverse Cross&#8208;&#946; Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A POSS&#8208;peptide amphiphile was constructed by conjugating cross&#8208;&#946; peptide with hydrophilic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). A single molecule unveils two distinctive transition pathways depending on water content. The POSS directs the unusual transition from the twisted to flat nanoribbons (pathway 2), which distinguishes it from the prevalently observed pathway 1 in &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide systems.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;&#946; structures are crucial in driving protein folding and aggregation. However, due to their strong aggregating tendency, the precise control of the self&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides remains a challenge. We propose a molecular geometry strategy to study and control the self&#8208;assembly of cross&#8208;&#946; structures. We conjugate the peptide with shape&#8208;persistent polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which acts as a hydrophilic head and senses the solvent environment. The POSS&#8208;peptide amphiphiles display two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways: twisted nanoribbons transforming into either nanotubes at low water content or flat nanoribbons at high water content. The peptide packing in flat nanoribbons is predominantly modulated by POSS, diverting the system away from crystal formation, which is the absolute lowest energy state of pure peptide self&#8208;assemblies. For the first time, we have demonstrated that POSS can serve as a useful tool to adjust the interactions between cross&#8208;&#946; strands, achieving fine&#8208;tuning of the pathway complexity (i.e., the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of peptide self&#8208;assembly). With this versatile molecular platform incorporating multiple functionalities of POSS and programable peptide sequences, this study provides a platform to exploit cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;based nanomaterials with functional and pathological significance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ energy&#8208;intensive external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented energy&#8208;efficient guest release behavior from sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals by specific vaporized molecules &#8220;squeezing&#8221; the crystal surface to close the cavity voids and release the guest molecules.

Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented molecular&#8208;squeeze triggered guest release behavior from sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals. The crystals function as typical sponge to include guest molecules within their microscopic voids that are adaptively formed, thus acting as adsorbents for toluene/pyridine separations. Intriguingly, vaporized ethyl acetate (EA) molecules trigger the guest release from the crystals without entering the pores or voids of the crystals to replace the guests. Instead, they work as external forces applied directly onto the crystals themselves, &#8216;&#8216;squeezing&#8221; the materials to close the voids through supramolecular interactions between EA and macrocycles on the crystal surface and release the guest molecules. Various experimental techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of the molecular&#8208;squeeze induced guest release procedure. The EA&#8208;regenerated crystals can be recycled multiple times without the loss of separation performance. Compared with conventional guest release procedure, this method is manipulated in a mild condition, showing the potential in saving cost and energy.

         <title>Identification of Key Post&#8208;modification Enzymes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Lanostane&#8208;type Triterpenoids in the Medicinal Mushroom Antrodia camphorata.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through different gene mining strategies, three key enzymes (AcCYP4, AcSDR6, AcSMT1) involved in the downstream biosynthesis of major lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids were discovered and identified from Antrodia camphorata. The catalytic mechanisms of AcSDR6 were elucidated by crystal structure analysis. These post&#8208;modification enzymes could be used to synthesize at least 11 major Antrodia lanostanoids.







Abstract
Lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids are important bioactive secondary metabolites of mushrooms, though their biosynthetic study has been challenging due to scattered genes. Herein, the strategies of combining metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, functional motif blast, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotation were used to discover three key post&#8208;modification enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lanostanoids in the medicinal mushroom Antrodia camphorata. The cytochrome P450 enzyme AcCYP4 could generate a &#916;7,9(11) diene structure and introduce a 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxy group to the triterpene skeleton. The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase AcSDR6 could regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of 3&#946;&#8208;OH to produce 3&#8208;keto triterpenoids, and the catalytic mechanisms were interpreted by crystal structure analysis. AcSMT1 could introduce the methyl group at C&#8208;24 to produce a unique 31&#8208;carbon triterpene skeleton. This work elucidated the major biosynthetic pathway of Antrodia lanostanoids in vitro, and the discovered enzymes could be used to synthesize a series of bioactive triterpenoids.

         <title>Enhancing Mechanical Durability and Long&#8208;Term Stability in Organic Solar Cells via Flexible Linker&#8208;Sequential Block Copolymerized Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors were successfully synthesized, and excellent efficiencies in both rigid binary (18.09&#8201;%) and ternary (19.05&#8201;%) as well as flexible binary (16.63&#8201;%) OSCs for flexible linker&#8208;sequential block MCD PM6&#8208;C10.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD were achieved, along with excellent long term photovoltaic stability (T80=9,078&#8197;h) and photo&#8208;stability (T80=568&#8197;h) in invert OSCs as well as outstanding crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) value of 49.88&#8201;% and 31.29&#8201;% in both pristine and blend films, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) hold great promise for improving both the efficiency and mechanical robustness of flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) owing to their facile molecular tunability and advantageous one&#8208;pot copolymerization. However, despite the excellent crystallinity imparted by their highly conjugated polymer backbone, MCDs often struggle to retain photovoltaic performance under large external deformations, limiting their applicability in wearable devices. Herein, we developed a novel series of flexible linker&#8208;sequential block MCDs (Fs&#8208;MCDs), specifically PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTB, PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTH, and PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD, by precisely incorporating flexible functional groups into the conjugated polymer skeleton. This design strategy introduced highly effective tensile active sites, resulting in remarkable mechanical durability, with PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD achieving crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 49.88&#8201;% in pristine films and 31.29&#8201;% in blends. The nearly 50&#8201;% COS in pristine films represents one of the highest values reported for Fs&#8208;MCD&#8208;based OSCs, marking a significant milestone in advancing f&#8208;OSC. Additionally, PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance, with efficiencies of 18.09&#8201;% in rigid binary and 19.05&#8201;% in ternary, as well as 16.63&#8201;% in flexible OSCs. It also showed impressive device stability in invert OSC (T80=9,078&#8197;h). This unique molecular design strategy provides a promising avenue for synergistically improving the photovoltaic performance, mechanical properties, and device stability of f&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Phenomics&#8208;Based Discovery of Novel Orthosteric Choline Kinase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an integrated phenomic approach we identified choline kinase alpha (CHKA) as an unexpected off&#8208;target of the methyltransferase inhibitor UNC0638 and its negative control UNC0737, shedding light on their mechanism of action. This discovery offers a drug&#8208;like starting for CHKA inhibitor development and investigating its role in immune metabolism.







Abstract
Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) is a central mediator of cell metabolism linked to cancer and immune regulation. Cellular and clinical evaluation of CHKA has been hampered by challenges in the development of drug&#8208;like choline kinase inhibitors. Here, we identify CHKA as an unexpected off&#8208;target of histone methyltransferase inhibitors using an integrated phenomic approach. We confirm CHKA as a direct protein target of the aminoquinazolines UNC0638 and UNC0737 using a combination of chemoproteomic, biochemical, cellular, and metabolic profiling assays, possibly explaining the previously reported discrepancies observed for different G9a/GLP inhibitor scaffolds in cellular assays. Using primary human cell model systems, we discover that CHKA modulation impairs IgG secretion and B&#8208;cell maturation consistent with the notion that choline metabolism plays an important role in immune signalling. Co&#8208;crystal structures of UNC0638 and UNC0737 with CHKA unravel an unexpected binding mode and suggest the inhibitors as attractive starting points for the development of selective chemical tools to further explore the biological role of CHKA in cancer and immune metabolism.

         <title>Spatially Isomeric Fulleropyrrolidines Enable Controlled Stacking of Perovskite Colloids for High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilize spatially isomeric fullerenes to finely control the crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskites, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Additionally, we use a well&#8208;defined fullerene bis&#8208;adduct, C60BB, to optimize the energy level alignment between the perovskite and the electron transport layer. As a result, the champion device achieves an efficiency of 16.05&#8201;% (certified: 15.86&#8201;%), surpassing the 16&#8201;% efficiency threshold.







Abstract
The advancement of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) has been severely hindered by the poor controllability of perovskite crystal growth and the energy level mismatch between the perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL). Here, we synthesized three cis&#8208;configured pyridyl&#8208;substituted fulleropyrrolidines (PPF), specifically 2&#8208;pyridyl (PPF2), 3&#8208;pyridyl (PPF3), and 4&#8208;pyridyl (PPF4), and utilized them as precursor additives to regulate the crystallization kinetics during film formation. The spatial distance between the two pyridine groups in PPF2, PPF3, and PPF4 increases sequentially, enabling PPF4 to interact with more perovskite colloidal particles. These interactions effectively enlarge the precursor colloid size and decelerate the crystallization rate of the perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality PPF4&#8208;based perovskite films with reduced defect density and lower exciton binding energy. Additionally, we incorporated a well&#8208;defined fullerene bis&#8208;adduct, C60BB, as an interlayer between the perovskite and PCBM layers to optimize energy level alignment. Through the synergistic effects of PPF4 and C60BB, our champion device achieved an efficiency of 16.05&#8201;% (certified: 15.86&#8201;%), surpassing the 16&#8201;% efficiency bottleneck and setting a new benchmark for TPSCs. Moreover, the devices exhibited outstanding stability, retaining 99&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 600&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun condition.

         <title>Confinement Microenvironment Regulation of Carbon Dots in Zeolite for Multi&#8208;Mode Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy is presented in CDs&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite system to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) induce green phosphorescence, and non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit temperature&#8208;related blue or red phosphorescence due to energy transfer. Finally, multi&#8208;mode time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color evolution with temperature variation in a single system is achieved.







Abstract
Matrix immobilization has been proven to be a favored method for enhancing the phosphorescence of carbon dots (CDs), however, it remains a significant challenge to realize time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPC) by embedding CDs with single emission center. In this study, we present a novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. The surrounding environment influences the surface state of the CDs, leading to the formation of different excitons. At low temperatures, Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) show fast&#8208;decaying green phosphorescence, while non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit inherent slow&#8208;decaying blue phosphorescence. Notably, the energy transfer occurs between NC&#8208;CDs and Mn2+ to produce an ultrafast&#8208;decaying red phosphorescence, with the intensity of the red component increasing as the temperature rises. The interplay of these luminescent centers with distinct decay rates activates fascinating multi&#8208;mode TDPC behavior as the temperature changes, resulting in dynamic afterglow evolutions from red to green at 298&#8197;K, orange to green at 273&#8197;K, and green to cyan to blue at 77&#8197;K. Leveraging the diverse luminescence of CDs@MnAPO&#8208;5, a multi&#8208;dimensional dynamic afterglow color pattern was developed for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Insight into Robust Anion Coordination Behavior of Organic Cathode with Dual Elongated &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites is proposed, containing both the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to nanonetwork organic structures.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials offer multi&#8208;electron reactivity, flexible structures, and redox reversibility, but encounter poor conductivity and durability in electrolytes. To overcome above barriers, we propose a dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites, involving the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to the nanonetwork feature of polymer structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 5,11&#8208;dihydridoindolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole (DHIC) is selected as the model cathode material for a dual&#8208;ion battery, with elongated carbazole groups functioning both as redox&#8208;active centers and polymerization anchors. Electrochemical comparisons and theoretical simulations validate the excellent specific capacity, accelerated reaction kinetics, and enhanced anion storage stability imparted by the dual elongated &#960;&#8208;conjugated system containing both carbazole motif and electropolymerized DHIC (pDHIC). Simultaneously, the coordination interaction between pDHIC and anions is innovatively evidenced through operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. As anticipated, pDHIC cathode delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 197&#8197;mAh/g at 50&#8197;mA/g, far outperforming graphite cathodes, and maintains excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86.1&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This synergetic strategy sheds light on the performance revolution of organic electrode materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis via the Synergy of Multiple Charge Transfer Channels and Polarized Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first example of piezo&#8208;photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Under the synergy of the intermolecular multiple&#8208;channel charge transfer and the piezoelectric polarization field, charge separation was greatly improved and ethenyl group&#8208;modified bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth) achieved a record&#8208;breaking H2O2 synthesis rate (9212&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) serve as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, while attaining high&#8208;performance COFs remains a formidable challenge due to the insufficient separation of photogenerated charges. Here, through the rational design of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs (Cz&#8208;COFs), we showcase the first achievement in piezo&#8208;photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 using COFs. Noteworthily, the ethenyl group&#8208;modified Cz&#8208;COFs (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth) demonstrates a record&#8208;high yield of H2O2 (9212&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) from air and pure water through piezo&#8208;photocatalysis, which is ca. 2.5&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Cz&#8208;COFs without ethenyl groups (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;H) under identical condition and COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth without ultrasonic treatment. The H2O2 production rate originates from the synergistic effect between an ultrasonication&#8208;induced polarized electric field and the spatially separated multiple charge transfer channels, which significantly promote the utilization of photogenerated electrons by directional transfer from bicarbazole groups to the ethenyl group&#8208;modified benzene rings. Several Cz&#8208;COFs and bifluorenylidene&#8208;based COFs (COF&#8208;BFTB&#8208;H) with similar twisted monomers exhibit obvious piezoelectric performance for promoting H2O2 generation, signifying that organic ligands with a twistable structure play a crucial role in creating broken symmetry structures, thereby establishing piezoelectric properties in COFs.

The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate originates from the synergistic effect between an ultrasonication-induced polarized electric field and the spatially separated multiple charge transfer channels, which significantly promote the utilization of photogenerated electrons by directional transfer from bicarbazole groups to the ethenyl group-modified benzene rings. Several Cz-COFs and bifluorenylidene-based COFs (COF-BFTB-H) with similar twisted monomers exhibit obvious piezoelectric performance for promoting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, signifying that organic ligands with a twistable structure play a crucial role in creating broken symmetry structures, thereby establishing piezoelectric properties in COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemocatalytic Conversion of Dinitrogen to Ammonia Mediated by a Tungsten Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tungsten complex capable of chemocatalyzing the conversion of N2 into NH3 is presented. The tungsten center is coordinated by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod/P5) phosphine ligand. By integrating a phospholano (Pln) group into the ligand structure we succeeded in obtaining the catalyst [W(N2)P5Pln]. Further investigations on the influence of the new P5Pln ligand on the catalytic ability of this tungsten complex were done.







Abstract
Whereas molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase, corresponding tungsten complexes were in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, we present a modified pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand in which two dimethylphosphine groups of the pentaPodMe (P5Me) ligand have been replaced with phospholanes (Pln). The derived molybdenum complex [Mo(N2)P5Pln] generates 22 and the analogous tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Pln] 7&#8197;equivalents of NH3 from N2 in the presence of 180&#8197;equivalents of SmI2(THF)2/H2O, rendering the latter the first tungsten complex chemocatalytically converting N2 to NH3. In contrast, the tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Me] generates ammonia from N2 only in a slightly overstoichiometric fashion. The reasons for these reactivity differences are investigated with the help of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods.

         <title>Chiral Metal Self&#8208;Assemblies of Zirconium&#8208;Tetrahedra and Their Second Harmonic Generation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the solvent conditions, three different supramolecular structures (Zr&#8208;&#945;, Zr&#8208;&#946; and Zr&#8208;&#947;) have been achieved by using metallo&#8208;tetrahedra as building blocks. Zr&#8208;&#945; is racemic and centrosymmetric, while Zr&#8208;&#946; and Zr&#8208;&#947; exhibit excellent second harmonic generation activities in second&#8208;order nonlinear optics based on their non&#8208;centrosymmetric characteristics.







Abstract
The chirality of metal&#8208;organic cages holds enormous potential for novel applications in diverse fields, while it is relatively rare to employ such asymmetric units for the construction of noncentrosymmetric materials. Herein, by self&#8208;assembling the 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotribenzoic acid (H3NBA) with bis(cyclopentadienyl)&#8208;zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2, Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5) in different solvent conditions, we have obtained three hierarchical packing modes of metallo&#8208;tetrahedra with distinct spatial symmetry groups (designated as Zr&#8208;&#945;, Zr&#8208;&#946;, and Zr&#8208;&#947;). Among them, Zr&#8208;&#945; employs a simple cubic arrangement and is a common centrosymmetric superstructure, which consists of a pair of equimolar metallo&#8208;tetrahedra enantiomers in its unit cell. While Zr&#8208;&#946; results in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution without using any resolving agents, giving rise to two enantiopure entities separately (Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;P, Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;M). More importantly, Zr&#8208;&#947; breaks the inversion center of symmetry and crystallizes into a racemic yet non&#8208;centrosymmetric superstructure with face&#8208;centered cubic packing mode. Based on the non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature, the hierarchical superstructure Zr&#8208;&#947; displayed good second harmonic generation activities. This work presents a successful instance wherein the reaction solvent induces the modulation of intermolecular packing mode to afford non&#8208;centrosymmetric solid materials, which can greatly promote the development of noncentrosymmetric solid (NCS) materials.

         <title>A Pyrrole&#8208;Fused Nanographene and its Edge&#8208;Perchlorinated Derivative Featuring a Corannulene Core and Five N&#8208;doped Heptagons</title>

         <dc:description>
A sunflower&#8208;like molecular structure of deca&#8208;nitrogen doped WNG (azaWNG) was synthesized via Scholl reaction. The azaWNG demonstrates a low oxidation potential and narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap due to ten interior nitrogen dopants, its electron&#8208;deficient core and extended &#960; system. The stability and solubility of azaWNG were improved through an edge&#8208;chlorination strategy, and the atom&#8208;precise structure has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A pyrrole&#8208;fused analogue of warped nanographene, designated as deca&#8208;nitrogen doped &#8242;WNG&#8242; (azaWNG), was synthesized through the annular fusion of decapyrroylcorannulene. The resulting azaWNG exhibited extremely limited solubility in common organic solvents and was characterized solely by mass spectrometry. Theoretical calculations revealed that azaWNG has a sunflower&#8208;like molecular structure with electron&#8208;deficient corannulene as the core and electron&#8208;rich pyrrole as the petals, demonstrating a significantly narrower energy gap compared to all&#8208;carbon WNG. To improve its solubility and facilitate precise structural characterization, iodine monochloride was utilized for edge&#8208;perchlorination of azaWNG, enabling successful separation and purification of chlorinated azaWNG in solution phase. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis unequivocally confirmed that edge&#8208;perchlorinated azaWNG contains 5 heptagons and 11 pentagons embedded within the warped &#960; skeleton. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the first oxidation potential of azaWNG is &#8722;0.59&#8197;V, representing the lowest value reported for any previously studied aza&#8208;nanographene. Consequently, azaWNG can be readily oxidized by AgPF6 or even atmospheric oxygen to yield stable oxidation states, as corroborated by UV/Visible absorption spectroscopy; this behavior is attributed to the fusion of ten pyrroles around corannulene. This work marks the first instance of nitrogen doping in WNG (C80H30), underscoring the significant modification to electronic structure induced by such doping.

A non&#8208;covalent assembly of a fentanyl hapten and immune&#8208;stimulating components in lipid nanoparticles induces fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies that can sequester fentanyl from the serum and prevent it from activating opioid receptors on cells.







Abstract
Opioid use disorder &#8208; particularly involving fentanyl &#8208; has precipitated a public health crisis characterized by a significant increase in addiction and overdose&#8208;related deaths. Fentanyl&#8208;specific immunotherapy, which aims at inducing fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies capable of binding fentanyl molecules in the bloodstream, preventing their entry in the central nervous system, is therefore gaining momentum. Conventional opioid designs rely on the covalent conjugation of fentanyl analogues to immunogenic carrier proteins that hold the inherent capacity of mounting immunodominant responses. Here, we present an alternative fentanyl vaccine design that utilizes a non&#8208;covalent assembly of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver fentanyl haptens in conjunction with a CD4+ T&#8208;helper peptide epitope and an imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonist. Our results demonstrate that a single intramuscular administration of the LNP&#8208;based nanovaccine elicits fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies, significantly mitigating the effects of opioid overdose in preclinical mouse models. Furthermore, we analyzed the immunobiological behavior of the vaccine in vivo in mouse models, providing evidence that covalent attachment of a fentanyl hapten to a carrier proteins or peptide epitope is not necessary for inducing an effective immune response. However, co&#8208;delivery &#8208; specifically, the physical assembly of all immune cues into an LNP &#8208; remains essential for inducing hapten&#8208;specific immunity.

&lt;p&gt;A non-covalent assembly of a fentanyl hapten and immune-stimulating components in lipid nanoparticles induces fentanyl-specific antibodies that can sequester fentanyl from the serum and prevent it from activating opioid receptors on cells.

         <title>Idealizing Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Film Competitive by Surface Lattice Etching&#8208;Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel in situ lattice etching&#8208;reconstruction strategy enabled by hot organic esters with low polarity to idealize air&#8208;processed perovskite films for competitive solar cells regardless of humidity. Arising from the dynamic dissolution of nanoimpurities and selective recrystallization of Br&#8208;rich phase on the defective perovskite surface, we deliver a champion PCE of 15.37&#8201;% for all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br cell with excellent stability.







Abstract
Air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells are desirable for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing application in the future, yet the presence of moisture and oxygen goes against perovskite crystallization and deteriorates phase stabilization, leading to the formation of substantial defective nano&#8208;impurities, especially on the vulnerable surface. Here, we propose a strategy to simultaneously remove superficial defect layer and solidify the surface by soaking air&#8208;fabricated perovskite film into low&#8208;polar organic esters at elevated temperature to trigger an in situ dynamic surface lattice disassemble and reconstruction process. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results indicate that the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is first dissolved and then the Br&#8208;rich phase is recrystallized at solid&#8211;liquid interface owing to the balance between weak solubility and high&#8208;temperature induced annealing process, thus hardening the soft surface and releasing the lattice tensile stress, which benefits the minimization of interfacial recombination and improvement of the structural stability. As a result, we prepare a carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br device in complete air without precise control on humidity, achieving a champion efficiency of 15.37&#8201;% with excellent resistance to harsh attackers. This method offers a promising avenue for overcoming the limit of processing conditions on advancing perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Suppression of Structural Heterogeneity in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range ordered L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) HEI with one&#8208;dimensionally aligned Pt/Ir and Fe/Mo/Bi columns were synthesized to improve the activity (5.2&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and selectivity (95&#8201;%) of GA via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR), representing the most active electrocatalyst for selective GA production.







Abstract
The key to fully realizing the potential of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) lies in balancing their inherent local chemical disordering with the long&#8208;range ordering required for electrochemical applications. Herein, we synthesized a distinctive L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) exhibiting nanoscale long&#8208;range order and atomic scale short&#8208;range disorder via a lattice compensation strategy to mitigate the entropy reduction tendency. The (PtIr)(FeMoBi) catalyst exhibited remarkable activity and selectivity of glycollic acid (GA) production via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). With a mass activity of 5.2&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for GA of 95&#8201;%, it outperformed most previously reported electrocatalysts for selective GA production. The lattice&#8208;compensation effect promotes the homogeneity of Pt and Fe actives sites, facilitating co&#8208;adsorption of EG and OH and reducing the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and OH&#8208;combination processes. This approach effectively avoids the formation of low&#8208;active sites commonly encountered in HEA solid solutions, offering a promising avenue for exploring the complex interplay between catalytic activity and HEI structures.

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a high&#8208;entropy strategy for high&#8208;voltage stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With a typical high&#8208;entropy chloride solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6, we show that the high&#8208;entropy strategy not only enhances the ionic conductivity but also realizes unprecedented high&#8208;voltage stability for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with a long cycling life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250&#8197;cycles with 81.4&#8201;% capacity retention when charged to 4.8&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000&#8197;cycles if charged to 4.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li). Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Transportation Across Liquid Membranes Mediated by Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This first report of using chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) as enantioselective carriers in bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) shows that CCOFs enhance the efficiency and enantioselectivity of amino acid separation. Exfoliating CCOFs into nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible sites, enabling the separation of chiral drug enantiomers unattainable with the pristine CCOFs.







Abstract
Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.

&lt;p&gt;This first report of using chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) as enantioselective carriers in bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) shows that CCOFs enhance the efficiency and enantioselectivity of amino acid separation. Exfoliating CCOFs into nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible sites, enabling the separation of chiral drug enantiomers unattainable with the pristine CCOFs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both -F and -&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet-mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high-performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Starfish&#8208;Inspired Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Conductive Membrane with Balanced Rigidity and Flexibility for Ultrastable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; solid&#8208;state electrolyte film (PAN/MOFs/ILs) with balanced rigidity and flexibility was developed, demonstrating excellent ionic conductivity (~4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), a wide electrochemical window (~5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (~0.69). Consequently, the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell achieved ultrastable cycling performance, retaining 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.







Abstract
The performance of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (SSLMB) is often constrained by the low ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical window, and insufficient mechanical strength of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. Inspired by the soft&#8208;outside, rigid&#8208;inside structure of starfish, we designed multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) using electrospinning technology. These CPEs feature a three&#8208;dimensional rigid skeleton network composed of polyacrylonitrile/metal&#8211;organic frameworks/ionic liquids (PAN/MOFs/ILs), creating continuous and efficient Li+ transport channels: MOFs impart rigidity, PEO acts as a cushioning outer layer to enhance interfacial compatibility, and ILs reduce interfacial resistance. The resulting CPEs exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a wide electrochemical window (5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (0.69). Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300&#8197;hours, and the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi&#8208;component solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature&#8208;inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes with extended lifespans.

         <title>Cover Picture: Tailoring the Properties of Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;Like Multiblock Polymers by Modulating the Branch Structure (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 7/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable polyethylene&#8208;like multiblock polymers offer tunable mechanical properties spanning LLDPE and LDPE while maintaining high melting temperatures. Synthesized using dehydrogenative polymerization, the glass transition temperature of these materials can be modulated through side&#8208;chain branching. They demonstrate chemical recyclability, selective depolymerization in mixed streams, and adjustable adhesive strength, promoting circularity and sustainable solutions for the plastic waste crisis, as reported by Garret M. Miyake et al in their Research Article (e202415707).

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Organonitrogen Compounds via Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated cascade reaction combines the electrochemical synthesis of hydroxylamine and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient pathway. The system alleviates the environmental crisis caused by the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle and reduces the waste of resources in the transport and purification process.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is a key intermediate in the formation of numerous high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds. The traditional synthesis of NH2OH requires the use of precious metals under high temperature conditions, which leads to high cost, high energy consumption, and environmental pollution. The NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction integrates the electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient alternative. This review presents the recent advances on electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds by NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. We present key concepts and the transformation process of different N&#8208;species to NH2OH, discuss suitable substrates and electrocatalysts, and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in generating compounds such as amino acids, cyclohexanone oxime, urea, amine, etc.. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in this emerging field to encourage further research effort and the development of NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction.

         <title>Innate Immune Activation with Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the roles of innate immune modulators (IIMs) in cancer therapy and their ability to enhance the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade and summarizes recent progress in the development of IIM nanotherapeutics to target cGAS&#8208;STING, TLR, and RLR pathways. Multifunctional nanoparticles combining IIMs and chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or tumor vaccines are discussed next, followed by brief summaries of the lessons learned, current challenges, and future perspectives in optimizing IIM nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers by leveraging the immune system to combat malignancies. However, its efficacy is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and other regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. Innate immune modulators (IIMs) provide potent immune activation to complement adaptive immune responses and help overcome resistance to ICB. This minireview provides an overview of IIMs and their roles in antitumor immune responses and summarizes recent advances in developing nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of IIMs to tumors for potentiating cancer immunotherapy and mitigating systemic toxicity. We discuss innovative nanoparticle platforms for the delivery of IIMs targeting the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes pathway, the toll&#8208;like receptor pathway, and the retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I&#8208;like receptor pathway. We review the preliminary clinical readouts of representative IIM nanoptherapeutics and highlight the development of multifunctional nanoparticles for combination treatments of IIMs with conventional treatment mdoalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynmic therapy, and tumor antigens. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from the existing systems, the challenges in the field, and future perspectives for this exciting field of nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Tetrazine Amplification System for Visual Detection of Trace Analytes via Click&#8208;Release Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrazine amplification system is introduced, utilizing a &#8220;click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle&#8221; (CROC) cascade amplification process. This study presents the construction of the CROC system and its application in visually detecting low concentrations of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and Pd&#8201;2&#8201;+. The system achieves a 10&#8201;5&#8208;fold amplification of the tetrazine signal, enabling detection at concentrations as low as 2&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Achieving visual detection of analytes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in complex mixtures remains a persistent challenge. While sophisticated techniques offer single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, practical hurdles remain, necessitating tailored signal amplification systems for direct visual detection. In this study, we develop a strategy for the visualized detection of tetrazine through a &#8220;click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle&#8221; (CROC) cascade amplification process. We systematically describe the construction and synthesis of this system, the kinetic process of click release, the kinetics of oxidation to tetrazine and its cascade amplification effect in trace amounts of tetrazine. This system is capable of amplifying the signal of tetrazine at a concentration as low as 2&#8197;nM by 105&#8208;fold, thereby providing a clearly visible purple signal. Finally, as proof of concept, we successfully apply this method to visually detect trace &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and Pd2+.

         <title>Adsorbate Resonance Induces Water&#8208;Metal Bonds in Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water in electrochemical environments forms hydrogen bonds with surface adsorbed intermediates, stabilizing them. However, the stabilization is not explained solely by hydrogen bonding, indicating additional effects. Using density functional theory (DFT) on coadsorbed OH and water on complex solid solutions (CSSs), we link the residual stabilization to resonance between near&#8208;surface water and *OH, which induces covalency for water to the surface.







Abstract
This study delves into the intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and H2O, on electrodes in electrochemical interfaces. These species are an inevitable part of many electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction. In our modeling, we utilize high statistics on a dataset of complex solid solutions with high atomic variability to show the emergence of H2O&#8208;metal covalent bonds under specific conditions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorption energies on many thousands of different surface compositions, we provide a quantifiable physical understanding of this induced water covalency, which is rooted in simple quantum mechanics. Directional hydrogen bonding between surface&#8208;near H2O and OH, enables surface bonding electrons to delocalize, mediated&#160;by near&#8208;symmetrical adsorbate resonance structures. The different adsorbate resonance structures differ by surface coordination explaining the induced H2O&#8208;metal bonding.

         <title>Porous Halogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Assembled through Hetero&#8208;polytopic Ion Pair Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetratopic halogen&#8208;bond donor with a discrete cation binding site was designed and synthesised. When crystallised with NaCl, a 3D framework is formed where the charge&#8208;balancing cation is sequestered in the 20&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moiety. The framework is porous to solvent and iodine vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactions.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions have been extensively studied in the preparation of crystalline frameworks, yet porous 3D framework materials built on XBs remain elusive. The donor&#8208;acceptor interactions are strengthened by use of anionic XB acceptors; however, the requisite charge&#8208;balancing cations typically disrupt the framework and occupy potential void space. In this work, we prepare a tetratopic XB donor bearing a crown ether moiety for sodium cation sequestration. We show that when this ionpair receptor is crystallised with NaCl it gives a 3D framework that is porous to solvent and vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal reactions.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;solid Fiber&#8208;shaped&#160;Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Fire Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible batteries such as scalable fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) hold great potential for powering wearable electronics due to their excellent electrochemical performance, flexibility, and weavability. However, the use of organic liquid electrolytes raises serious safety concerns, including leakage and combustion hazards. In this study, we develop fire&#8208;resistant lithium cobalt oxide/graphite FLIBs by employing an in&#8208;situ polymerized gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) incorporating 1,3,3,5,5&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) as a flame retardant and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as a crosslinker. This in&#8208;situ polymerization of GPE is well&#8208;suited for continuous FLIB production and enhances the electrolyte/electrode interface. The resulting GPE eliminates the inherent flammability of liquid electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time, attributed to a dual flame&#8208;retardant mechanism: gas&#8208;phase free radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation. Notably, the FLIBs using the flame&#8208;retardant GPEs demonstrate no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under various abusive conditions, including mechanical abuse (cutting or collision), electrical abuse (overcharging or overdischarging), and thermal abuse (overheating or fire hazards). Additionally, these FLIBs achieve excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles, and retain 99.8% of capacity after 10,000 bending cycles, highlighting their outstanding durability. This work presents an effective and straightforward approach to greatly enhance the safety and practicality of FLIBs for wearable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance: Innovative Drugs in Antibacterial Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides an overview over antibacterial drugs investigated in the past three decades. Aspects of the compound's origins, their cellular targets, the antibacterial spectrum and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in animal studies are covered and current trends are highlighted.







Abstract
In the fight against bacterial infections, particularly those caused by multi&#8208;resistant pathogens known as &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, the need for new antibacterials is undoubted in scientific communities and is by now also widely perceived by the general population. However, the antibacterial research landscape has changed considerably over the past years. With few exceptions, the majority of big pharma companies has left the field and thus, the decline in R&amp;D on antibacterials severely impacts the drug pipeline. In recent years, antibacterial research has increasingly relied on smaller companies or academic research institutions, which mostly have only limited financial resources, to carry a drug discovery and development process from the beginning and through to the beginning of clinical phases. This review formulates the requirements for an antibacterial in regard of targeted pathogens, resistance mechanisms and drug discovery. Strategies are shown for the discovery of new antibacterial structures originating from natural sources, by chemical synthesis and more recently from artificial intelligence approaches. This is complemented by principles for the computer&#8208;aided design of antibacterials and the refinement of a lead structure. The second part of the article comprises a compilation of antibacterial molecules classified according to bacterial target structures, e.g. cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, as well as more recently emerging target classes, e.g. fatty acid synthesis, proteases and membrane proteins. Aspects of the origin, the antibacterial spectrum, resistance and the current development status of the presented drug molecules are highlighted.

         <title>Chemically Patterning Lithiophilic Interphase to Harmonize Spatial Electrons and Thermal Catalysis Dynamics for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of elaborated chemically patterning to decorate Cu foil was proposed to harmonize spatial Li+ and facilitate thermal catalysis dynamics for stable and safe lithium metal batteries. The compact electrode with lithiophilic array regulated Li plating/stripping behavior, mitigating Li dendrite formation. Moreover, the composite electrode can suppress smoke and reduce toxicity during the battery thermal runaway process, making a significant improvement for next&#8208;generation safe lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries have garnered significant attention as promising energy storage solutions. However, their performance is often compromised by the risks associated with highly active metallic lithium, unrestricted electrode expansion, and excessive dendrites growth. Here we introduce an advanced lithiophilic anode substrate designed by chemically patterning technology for multiple security enhancements. The innovative lithiophilic array harmonizes spatial Li+ to prepare compact and reversible electrodes. The composite electrodes feature an enhanced C&#8722;F component in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, which protects the deposited lithium metal from unwanted side reactions, thereby stabilizing electrochemical cycling. Notably, the thermal safety can be revealed through the substrate&#8216;s excellent catalytic ability to convert smoke and toxic gases during extreme thermal runaway. This work demonstrates a novel approach to integrating battery cycling stability with thermal safety, paving the way for more reliable and secure energy storage systems.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Olympic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaporation&#8208;assisted approach was used to fabricate ring&#8208;interlocked elastomers, wherein DMF was removed from the LpHE/DMF system to facilitate the formation of a global LpHE polycatenane network as a representative example. This method offers a simple, versatile, and effective strategy for the fabrication of topologically intricate materials.







Abstract
Catenated networks exclusively composed of intertwining rings were first envisioned as &#8220;Olympic gels&#8221; by Pierre&#8208;Gilles de Gennes four decades ago but have not been successfully prepared in artificial materials yet due to the challenge in synthesis. Herein, we present a bio&#8208;inspired, evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy to address this issue. In our design, the evaporation of liquid catalysts that induce ring&#8208;chain equilibrium of polymer systems drives macrocycles to encounter and assists their catenation through reversible cyclization. Complete removal of liquid catalysts stabilizes the resulting ring&#8208;interlocked networks by deactivating the catenation&#8208;decatenation process. The strategy is demonstrated by the system of hydroxyethyl lipoate (LpHE) and dimethyl formamide (DMF). The results indicate that DMF evaporation leads to the formation of global LpHE polycatenane networks. This evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy displays versatility in several tested cyclic monomers, highlighting its potential as a general approach to fabricate ring&#8208;interlocked elastomers and topologically intricate materials.

         <title>CO Cryo&#8208;Sorption as a Surface&#8208;Sensitive Spectroscopic Probe of the Active Site Density of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first identification of the spectroscopic fingerprint and quantification for CO probe molecules adsorbed to Fe&#8208;N4 sites by a corroborated investigation of in situ surface X&#8208;ray spectroscopic techniques (NAP&#8208;XPS and &#8208;NEXAFS) and ab initio DFT calculations. The DFT calculations suggest explanations for the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption.







Abstract
Quantifying the number of active sites is a crucial aspect in the performance evaluation of single metal&#8208;atom electrocatalysts. A possible realization is using adsorbing gas molecules that selectively bind to the single&#8208;atom transition metal and then probing their surface density using spectroscopic tools. Herein, using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, we detect adsorbed CO gas molecules on a FeNC oxygen reduction single atom catalyst. Correlating XPS and NEXAFS, we develop a simple surface&#8208; and chemically&#8208;sensitive protocol to accurately and quickly quantify the active site density. Density functional theory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray spectra simulations reaffirm the assignment of the spectroscopic fingerprints of the CO molecules adsorbed at Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites, and provide additional unexpected structural insights about the active site needed to explain the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption. Our work represents an important step towards an accurate quantitative catalytic performance evaluation, and thus towards developing reliable material design principles and catalysts.

         <title>Selective Hydrodisulfuration of Alkenes with Dithiosulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we have discovered the versatility of the dithiosulfonate reagent (ArSO2&#8211;SSR) in transition metal catalyzed selective hydrodisulfuration of unactivated alkenes. The hydrodisulfuration displays a unique Markovnikov selectivity with a Salen&#8208;cobalt complex, while an anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity is observed when employing a nickel/bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand. Furthermore, precise control over nickel/ligand enables the successful achievement of remote site&#8208;selective hydrodisulfuration for both internal and terminal alkenes via a chain&#8208;walking process. In these processes, silanes are employed as a hydride source. Mechanistic insights into these innovative catalytic systems are also elucidated. Experimental findings suggest that Markovnikov hydrodisulfuration is likely to proceed through radical substitution on dithiosulfonate reagents, while nickel&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity and remote site&#8208;selectivity likely occur via the radical addition of the reductively formed dithiosulfonate radical anion ([ArSO2&#8211;SSR]&#183;&#175;) to alkyl Ni(II) species (alkyl&#8211;Ni(II)LnX) and subsequent reductive elimination on Ni(III) intermediate (alkyl&#8211;Ni(III)Ln(X)&#8211;SSR) as the key steps based on DFT calculation analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakening Solvent&#8208;Solute Interactions for High&#8208;Efficiency Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Screen printing has emerged as a leading candidate for industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics. However, strong solvent&#8208;solute interaction in conventional formulations accelerates the preferential crystallization of perovskites at points, hindering the progressive phase evolution from point to line to plane. In this work, we introduced halogen ions to weaken solvent&#8208;solute interactions, achieving the reduced Pb&#183;&#183;&#183;O coordination strength counterbalanced by enhanced Pb&#8208;I bonding interactions. This weakened interaction delays formamidinium iodide participation in rapid phase transitions to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide, enabling controlled crystallization kinetics. The optimized screen&#8208;printed perovskite solar cells demonstrate remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 21.8% for 0.05 cm&#178; devices and 18.95% for 5 cm &#215; 5 cm mini&#8208;modules (active area: 12.60 cm&#178;). Furthermore, this strategy exhibits broad process compatibility, achieving 23&#8208;24% PCEs for both blade&#8208;coating and spin&#8208;coating devices fabricated under ambient conditions (25&#8208;30 &#176;C, 35&#8208;50% relative humidity). These breakthroughs highlight the universal potential of coordination engineering for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

Furthermore, this strategy exhibits broad process compatibility, achieving 23-24% PCEs for both blade-coating and spin-coating devices fabricated under ambient conditions (25-30 &#176;C, 35-50% relative humidity). These breakthroughs highlight the universal potential of coordination engineering for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile Strategy to Transform Cationic Polymers for Efficient and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The progress of mRNA therapeutics underscores the imperative demand for the development of targeted delivery systems. While cationic polymers hold promise as genetic vectors, their poor in vivo efficacy and numerous variants highlight the urgent need for a universal functionalization strategy to bolster their delivery capabilities. Here, we present a versatile strategy to transform low&#8208;cost commercial cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), enabling efficient and organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery in vivo. This straightforward post&#8208;functionalization method can be readily broadened to a diverse array of existing cationic polymers, enhancing their cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release functionalities. Consequently, PAPs facilitate up to 30,500&#8208;fold higher mRNA expression compared to their unmodified counterparts in vivo. Notably, the one&#8208;component PAPs enable spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery, with their vaccine application validated in a mouse melanoma model following intravenous administration. Better still, PAPs can synergize with different helper lipids to formulate four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), achieving respective lung&#8208; and liver&#8208;specific mRNA delivery. Noteworthy is that these organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery systems significantly outperform previous polymer and LNP benchmarks. This transformation strategy for cationic polymers represents a generalized methodology to give highly effective mRNA carriers, highlighting substantial potential for clinical translation of mRNA therapies with organ&#8208;targeting requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of multi&#8208;emission enantiomers, (R)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ and (S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ, was designed and synthesized by integrating Se&#8208;induced conformationally isomeric donors with a chiral carbonyl&#8208;containing acceptor into a unified molecular framework. The enantiomers showed white emission with blue, yellow and red multi&#8208;emission bands in solution and film at CIE coordinates of (0.39, 0.35) and (0.33, 0.34), respectively. Doped film of the enantiomers achieved a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 42%, accompanied by mirror&#8208;image white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPPL) signals with a |g&#119875;&#119871;| value of 2.6 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Moreover, the enantiomers also showed white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33) and EQEmax of 3.1%. Notably, this work represents the first single&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;emission WCPL materials and achieved the highest performance for white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule organic materials with phosphorescent properties. Furthermore, leveraging Bragg reflection from dual&#8208;layer cholesteric liquid crystals, the enantiomers achieved |gPL| and |gEL| values of 1.85 and 1.88, respectively, marking the highest reported values for WCPPL and WCPEL to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically Chiral Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems Comprising N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes: Stabilization of the Cationic Species by &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the efficient stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cations in a dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulene bridged by a rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated [5]helicene backbone (NTH). The rigid scaffold exhibits helical chirality, allowing the enantiomers to be separated and their chiroptical properties studied, including circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Successive oxidation towards the radical cation NTH&#8226;+ and dication NTH2+ reveals strong electronic communication between the two nitrogen&#8208;centers, as demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, electrochemistry, UV/Vis/nIR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. CD measurements of the enantiomerically pure cations reveal strong Cotton effects in the nIR region extending up to 2000 nm. Density functional theory confirms the observed enhanced electronic communication, classifying NTH&#8226;+ as a Robin&#8208;Day Class III mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer (MV&#8208;CT) system. NTH2+ exhibits a quinoidal structure with partial diradical character and open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, as shown by variable temperature EPR measurements. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy shows the photo&#8208;induced generation of NTH&#8226;+ in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Multichannel Photon&#8208;Stimulated C&#8208;C Coupling for CO2 Reduction in a Mixed Water/Acetonitrile Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing effective photocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a precise understanding of the dynamically photocatalytic mechanism under real conditions (e.g. solvent, light field). Herein, we coupled ab&#8208;initio non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation to theoretically reveal the detailed dynamic process for C&#8208;C Coupling under light field on Co&#8208;supported monolayer black phosphorus (BP) catalyst Co@BP. Specially, Co@BP features excellent property for photocatalyst: high stability, long&#8208;lived photogenerated carriers and stronger reducing ability. Thermodynamically, it shown that a dramatic difference in catalytic properties with 99.99% selectivity for HCOOH in solvent&#8208;free condition (Ea = 0.29 eV) and 99.34% selectivity for CH2CH2 in solution (Ea = 0.33 eV). Slow&#8208;growth based MD simulation results uncover that mixed solvent of water/acetonitrile (H2O/ACN) is beneficial for the formation of C2+ product and the optimal ratio H2O/ACN (1:9) mixture solvent for the conversion of CO2 to CH2CH2. Under light irradiation, we found that multichannel photons enable adsorbed CHO* to couple with CHO species diffusing from nearby active sites, further forming C2 intermediates in solution. This work highlights the importance of the reaction medium on the photogenerative carrier dynamics and offers a strategy to regulate product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Regulation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photoredox Catalysis toward Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a thriving class of photocatalysts in various chemical transformations. However, the utilization of COFs as photoredox catalysts for atom transfer radical polymerization is rarely known. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of phenazine&#8208;based functional 3D COFs with the dia topology. Structural regulation over interpenetration folds and energy levels of COFs was implemented through the substituent effects. These COFs can work as effective photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization. Notably, the COF with trifluoromethyl substituent groups exhibits much higher catalytic activity than other COFs, allowing the efficient synthesis of polymers with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high conversion. Notably, it constitutes the most efficient one among all the metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. This work not merely realizes the structural regulation of 3D COFs through substituent effects, but also exhibits brilliant prospects for the utilization of COFs as efficient catalysts in a bunch of challenging chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Imide Double Antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE = Ca, Sr; Pn = Sb, Bi) as Potential Solar Cell Absorber Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An abundance of oxide, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have been explored, demonstrating outstanding properties, while the emerged nitride perovskites are extremely rare due to their challenging synthesis requirements. By inverting the ion type in the perovskite structure, the corresponding antiperovskite structure is obtained. Among them, ternary antiperovskite nitrides X3AN (X = Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg; A = As, Sb) have recently been identified as exhibiting excellent optoelectronic properties. To explore the unrealized composition space of nitride perovskites, the ammonothermal method was applied, yielding three new layered quaternary imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites, namely AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE = Ca, Sr; Pn = Sb, Bi). These new compounds feature distorted square&#8208;pyramidal coordination around the imide&#8208;group (Ca5NH). Layers with Ca2+ vacancies are found with an alternating As3&#8722; and Pn3&#8722; (Pn3&#8722; = Sb3&#8722;, Bi3&#8722;) coordination along the A&#8208;site, forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure. All three AE5AsPn(NH)2 compounds show suitable direct band gaps within the visible light spectrum.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An abundance of oxide, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have been explored, demonstrating outstanding properties, while the emerged nitride perovskites are extremely rare due to their challenging synthesis requirements. By inverting the ion type in the perovskite structure, the corresponding antiperovskite structure is obtained. Among them, ternary antiperovskite nitrides X3AN (X = Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg; A = As, Sb) have recently been identified as exhibiting excellent optoelectronic properties. To explore the unrealized composition space of nitride perovskites, the ammonothermal method was applied, yielding three new layered quaternary imide-based defect-antiperovskites, namely AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE = Ca, Sr; Pn = Sb, Bi). These new compounds feature distorted square-pyramidal coordination around the imide-group (Ca5NH). Layers with Ca2+ vacancies are found with an alternating As3&#8722; and Pn3&#8722; (Pn3&#8722; = Sb3&#8722;, Bi3&#8722;) coordination along the A-site, forming a two-dimensional (2D) structure. All three AE5AsPn(NH)2 compounds show suitable direct band gaps within the visible light spectrum. Density functional theory calculations reveal favorable band dispersion, as well as transport and optical properties, especially along the out-of-plane direction, demonstrating their 3D character of electronic transport. The narrow tunable direct band gaps and favorable charge carrier properties make AE5AsPn(NH)2 promising candidates for solar cell absorber materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters as Highly Efficient, Versatile Type&#8208;II Photoinitiators via Generating Radicals from Non&#8208;Conventional Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of highly efficient photocatalysis or photoinitiation systems that are applicable to various types of illumination source is critical to virtually all the light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to achieve highly sensitive, versatile photoinitiation systems based on the combination of metal nanoclusters with non&#8208;conventional hydrogen donors (co&#8208;initiators). Discovery of this type&#8208;II photoinitiation pathway in metal nanoclusters not only improves their two&#8208;photon initiation sensitivity by up to three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude, it further opens the door for metal nanoclusters to trigger the photopolymerization using the low&#8208;power UV light&#8208;emitting diodes. Different from molecular type&#8208;II photoinitiators, we found that the selection rules of hydrogen donors for metal nanoclusters are largely dependent on their ligand structures. More importantly, using electron paramagnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, we for the first time demonstrate that the photoexcited metal nanoclusters can function as versatile hydrogen atom abstractors which generate various types of previously unreported thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. This finding indicates the broad opportunity of the future application of metal nanoclusters in light&#8208;driven organic synthesis and radical chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy from the Stepped Hollow FeHCFe Nanocubes and the Dimorphic Polypyrrole for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Water Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saline water desalination is an important route to increase freshwater supply, while capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technique to tackle this issue. To boost the success of CDI, development of advanced electrode materials is vital. Herein, we innovatively designed a sophisticated Prussian blue/dimorphic polypyrrole composite for hybrid CDI (HCDI). Specifically, the nanoparticle&#8208;like polypyrrole (PPy) in&#8208;situ distributed on the stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes' surface, while coexisting nanotube&#8208;like PPy interconnected the discrete stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes. The introduction of dimorphic PPy promoted both electron and ion dynamics, and improved the electrochemical activity of FeHCFe. Meanwhile, the unique FeHCFe nanocubes offered large accessible contact area for electrolyte, reduced Na+ migration path, improved tolerance for lattice expansion, and optimized redox sites for Na+ storage. Through such unique structural design and synergistic combination, the FeHCFe/PPy achieved a remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate outperforming related materials. Moreover, the treated solution can meet drinking water standard within 6 min via six tandem HCDI cells. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed&#160;Na+ capture mechanism and provided fundamental understanding of the rapid Na+ migration and large Na+ storage. This study provides insights into ration design of superior electrode materials for high&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Potent Molecular Glue Degraders for NIMA&#8208;related Kinase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation within cells. While chemoproteomics has unveiled hundreds of potential MGD targets, very few proteins are degraded by highly selective and potent MGDs. Here, we developed a novel glutarimide analog with a tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine scaffold that exhibited strong NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) degradation potential. Further optimization led to the identification of LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 as a leading NEK7 MGD candidate, demonstrating potent activity with a half&#8208;maximal degradation (DC50) of 7 nM and a maximum degradation (Dmax) of 90% in MOLT&#8208;4 cells. Notably, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 displayed high selectivity for NEK7 across the proteome. Mechanistic studies indicated that the degradation was mediated by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) and relied on the glycine 57 (G57)&#8208;containing degron motif in NEK7. Additionally, two amino acids adjacent to the degron motif were found to be crucial for modulating the compound's selectivity and potency, underscoring the significance of neighboring residues in MGD design. Moreover, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 effectively inhibited secretion of the downstream cytokines, including IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;18, highlighting the potential therapeutic applications of NEK7 MGDs in treating inflammatory diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Silicon Nucleophiles in Bismuth Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a catalytic protocol utilizing bismuth for the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones, showcasing a seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis. This catalytic process is enabled by a series of Bi&#8208;based organometallic transformations, including an unprecedented transmetalation of aryl silicates to Bi(III) complexes and the formal migratory insertion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the Bi&#8210;C bond. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8210;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization Thermodynamics Regulation of 1.85 eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient and Stable Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with adjustable bandgaps can be integrated with organic solar cells to form tandem solar cells (TSCs), thereby surpassing the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit.&#160;    However, increasing Br content to elevate the bandgap above 1.8 eV complicates crystallization, leading to inferior film quality and defects due to the unmanageable evolution of intermediate phases. Surface passivation improves crystallization but hard to moderate the inhomogeneous component distributions and defects in the bulk phase.&#160;Here, we introduce a diammonium salt as an additive to regulate the homogeneity and crystallization of perovskite film, eliminating the low&#8208;dimensional intermediate phase for orientated crystallization of 1.85 eV perovskite, resulting in efficient wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with&#160;an impressive&#160;open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.379 V and operational stability remaining 85% of their initial efficiency after illumination for 1200 h. Furthermore, perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.03% and a high&#160;VOC&#160;of 2.108 V, one of the highest&#160;VOC&#160;for perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin State Regulation for Peroxide Activation: Fundamental Insights and Regulation Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxides are widely used in environmental applications due to their strong oxidizing properties, however, traditional activation methods often face challenges such as uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and high energy barriers. Recent advancements in spin state regulation provide a promising alternative to enhance the efficiency of peroxide activation. This review provides an overview of spin fundamentals and discusses the key factors affecting spin state in catalytic materials, including crystal field configuration, ligand environment, and valence changes. Subsequently, the role of electron spin state in peroxide activation is comprehensively analyzed, with a focus on how spin state regulation can tune adsorption energy, lower energy barriers, facilitate electron transfer between transition metals and peroxides, and promote selective ROS generation. Finally, this review briefly outlines the practical applications of peroxide activation in water treatment and concludes with a summary and perspectives on future research directions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of spin state regulation in advancing peroxide activation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Origin of the Stretchability and Fatigue&#8208;Resistance of Rotaxane&#8208;based Mechanically Interlocked Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rotaxane&#8208;based polymer networks leveraging host&#8208;guest recognition have recently emerged as a versatile platform for developing smart materials. Despite numerous studies on these polymers, their unique mechanical properties are mostly associated with the sliding motion of the macrocycle along the axle, leaving the impact of the presence or absence of interlocked structures on the mechanical performance of materials yet to be directly demonstrated. In this work, we present a densely (pseudo)rotaxane&#8208;based supramolecular polymeric network (SPN) and a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) as model systems to explore how the mechanical interlocking unit dominates the material properties. Specifically, we have achieved a significant transition from SPN to MIN by finely tuning the stopper size, just substituting a methyl with a dimethyl group attached to the phenyl ring. Although their stereochemical structures are similar, a subtle increase in the stopper size can lead to striking improvements in stretchability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. The stopper size&#8208;relevant dethreading behavior, as evidenced by a combined approach of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and rheology, is the underlying molecular mechanism for the difference in the macroscopic mechanical properties. We anticipate that the fundamental understanding gained from this work will advance the development of rotaxane&#8208;based materials with emergent functions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Broadband&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition and Thermoinduced Cycloreversion&#8208;Powered Dynamic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanically responsive dynamic molecular crystals are central to developing efficient, rapid, and robust materials capable of conversion of light energy to mechanical work. However, unlike some other, mainly photochromic molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems, solids in which the photoinduced [2+2] cycloaddition undergoes have not been explored to power reversible actuation, despite that this reaction system carries an unexplored potential in the heavily strained bonds of the cyclobutane ring, the common chemical moiety in the natural products. In this study, we propose that broadband&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition can be used to store energy and actuate dynamic organic crystals by irradiation with visible light. The prototypical material, pyrenylvinylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (1&#8208;PVPyL), undergoes a topochemical [2+2] cycloaddition induced not only by ultraviolet radiation (365 nm) but also by monochromatic green light (532 nm), red light (620 nm) and broadband visible light in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal&#160;manner, causing its crystals to bend. The crystals effectively act as energy depots, where the reverse deformation can be initiated by heating and the stored energy is released via thermal cycloreversion reaction. Given the ubiquity of the [2+2] cycloaddition in the solid state, the current study invites the development of new dimeric architectures that utilize sunlight for energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ph3PC &#8211; A Monosubstituted C(0) Atom in Its Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as carbodiphosphoranes, monovalent C(0) compounds are largely underrepresented in chemistry. Now the first monovalent C(0) compound, Ph3P&#8594;C, has been characterized, in which triphenylphosphine forms a bond to a carbon atom in its electronic 3P ground state. Owing to its diradical nature, EPR and ENDOR studies clearly confirm this assignment with support from quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel class of carbon&#8208;centered diradicals: a monosubstituted C atom stabilized by a phosphine. The diradical Ph3P&#8594;C was photochemically generated from a diazophosphorus ylide precursor (Ph3PCN2) and characterized by EPR and isotope&#8208;sensitive ENDOR spectroscopy at low temperatures. Ph3P&#8594;C features an axial zero&#8208;field splitting parameter D=0.543&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with a vanishingly small rhombicity |E|/D=0.002. Time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent measurements confirm a triplet ground state with a lifetime of approximately 10&#8197;min at 127&#8197;K in toluene&#8208;d8. Multireference electronic structure calculations predict a clear triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet gap greater than 20&#8197;kcal/mol. In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as Ph3P&#8594;C&#8592;PPh3, in which carbon needs excitation into a highly&#8208;excited closed&#8208;shell 2s02p4 configuration, Ph3P&#8594;C can be explained by direct involvement of carbon in its natural 3P state arising from the 2s22p2 configuration.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbon Fixation Using Photosynthetic Organelles in Artificial Photosynthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthetic organelles were constructed to efficiently produce ATP in the presence of phycocyanin. They were encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles together with a carbon fixation pathway to build artificial photosynthetic cells to produce acetyl&#8208;CoA upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Building an artificial photosynthetic cell from scratch helps to understand the working mechanisms of chloroplasts. It is a challenge to achieve carbon fixation triggered by photosynthetic organelles in an artificial cell. ATP synthase and photosystem II (PSII) are purified and reconstituted onto the phospholipid membrane to fabricate photosynthetic organelles. With the integration of phycocyanin, the ATP production yield increases by 2.51&#8208;fold due to the enhanced light harvesting capability. The carbon fixation pathway is established by converting &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate with cascade enzyme reactions including the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), aconitase (ACO), and ATP citrate lyase (ACL). The photosynthetic organelles, phycocyanin, and carbon fixation pathway are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles to obtain artificial photosynthetic cells, which convert &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate inside artificial cells upon light irradiation. The acetyl&#8208;CoA is the most important intermediate product in the cellular metabolic networks for the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our results provide a way for efficient light energy conversion to produce ATP and fix CO2, and pave the path to build autonomous artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks.

         <title>Rigidly Locked Pyrene Excimers in Planar Chiral Pyrenophanes for Intense and Stable Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. These compounds reveal intense and stable circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), thus making them attractive platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications, such as chiral sensing.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platforms with excellent performances in both circularly polarized photoluminescence (CP&#8208;PL) and electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL), a new family of pyrenophanes with rigidly locked pyrene dimers and varied bridges has been designed and synthesized. Attributed to densely packed pyrene excimers, the resultant pyrenophanes revealed tunable bridge&#8208;dependent emission behaviors, as investigated by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. More importantly, all these planar chiral pyrenophanes display strong CP&#8208;PL with large dissymmetry factor (gPL) values up to 0.034, and such excellent performances remain stable in a wide range of solvents, temperatures, and concentrations. Attractively, the highest gECL values up to 0.014 reported so far has been achieved for the CP&#8208;ECL emissions of the chiral pyrenophanes. Attributed to their unique structural features and outstanding CPL performances, these novel pyrenophanes could serve as promising platforms for both fundamental investigations on pyrene excimers and practical applications such as chiral sensing.

         <title>Regulating Interphase Chemistry by Targeted Functionalization of Hard Carbon Anode in Ester&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent high reactive oxygen&#8208;functional groups of hard carbon (HC) anode are strategically converted into a stable Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer for regulating uncontrollable interfacial redox reaction energy and charge transfer, suppressing the interfacial side reactions, and contributing to the construction of inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial resistance and enhanced cycling durability.







Abstract
Commercial hard carbon (HC) anode suffers from unexpected interphase chemistry rooted in the parasitic reactions between surface oxygen&#8208;functional groups and ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to regulate interphase chemistry by tailoring targeted functional groups on the HC surface, where highly active undesirable oxygen&#8208;functional groups are skillfully converted into a Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si molecular layer favorable for anchoring anions. Then, an inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhanced cycling durability is constructed successfully. Consequently, the modified HC anode delivers an excellent rate capability of 206.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the coin&#8208;type full&#8208;cell equipped with Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode exhibits an exceptional capacity retention ratio of 80.9&#8201;% after 800 cycles at 1C. The present simple and effective interfacial modification strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for promoting the development and practicability of HC anode in ester&#8208;based electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Imine&#8208;Based Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors Featuring Degradability and Biocompatibility for Transient Bioinspired Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a regiochemistry&#8208;regulated backbone curvature approach to achieve two novel imine&#8208;based polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. These materials exhibit excellent electrochemical transistor performance with structural disorder&#8208;tolerance upon doping, efficient acid&#8208;degradability, and tunable film crystallinity, enabling the conversion from volatile to non&#8208;volatile operation in OECT based artificial synapses. This demonstrates great potential for advancing sustainable, bio&#8208;inspired transient electronics.







Abstract
Degradable features are highly desirable to advance next&#8208;generation organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) for transient bioinspired artificial intelligence devices. It is highly challenging that OMIECs exhibit excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic behavior and show degradability simultaneously. Specially, in OMIECs, doping is often a tradeoff between structural disorder and charge carrier mobilities. Here, we describe a regiochemistry&#8208;driven backbone curvature approach to prepare OMIECs, enabling doped state ordered within efficient ionic&#8208;electronic conduction in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and presenting degradable characteristics. Significantly, i&#8208;3gTIT shows an outstanding mobility (1.99&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and &#956;C* (302&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and presents higher disorder&#8208;tolerance upon doping and faster degradation behavior than its regioisomer, o&#8208;3gTIT. Especially, the resulting OECT&#8208;based inverter shows a high voltage gain of 31.6&#8197;V&#8201;V&#8722;1 at a low driving voltage of 0.6&#8197;V. Moreover, we demonstrate an application of transient OECT, i.&#8197;e., biodegradable solid&#8208;state electrolyte of OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses. Remarkably, the regiochemistry&#8208;driven film crystallinity modulation enables the conversion from volatile to non&#8208;volatile operation in such synapses. The transient synapse based on i&#8208;3gTIT achieves over 90&#8201;% recognition accuracy for small digit handwritten images, showing potential in security neuromorphic computing. Our work is the first presentation enabling excellent mixed conduction of OMIECs with degradable features for transient bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Operando Nanoscale Characterization Reveals Fe Doping of Ni Oxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Fragmentation and Formation of Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando nanoscale characterization of Ni oxide catalysts (NiOx) reveals that Fe doping enhances oxygen evolution activity by increasing the active surface area via island fragmentation and forming dual active centers of Ni and Fe atoms. Combining atomically precise growth under ultra&#8208;high vacuum and exfoliation of 2D materials for electrocatalytic studies, we uncover both the hydroxylation step and the dynamic nature of active sites under OER conditions.







Abstract
Efficient catalytic water splitting demands advanced catalysts to improve the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides show promising OER activity in alkaline media. However, most experimental information available is either from post&#8208;mortem studies or in&#8197;situ space&#8208;averaged X&#8208;ray techniques in the micrometer range. Therefore, the composition of the active centers under operando conditions is still under debate. In this work, we combine nanoscopic and spectroscopic measurements on the hydroxylation of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;prepared Ni and NiFe oxides nanoislands with operando local investigations of Ni and NiFe hydroxide electrocatalysts under OER conditions to reveal the nature of the active centers in 2D OER catalysts. Our results reveal that Fe doping increases the active surface area by island fragmentation, and boosts the intrinsic activity by creating optimized active centers consisting of both Ni and Fe atoms. In addition, our findings show that operando characterization at the nanoscale is crucial to reveal the dynamic nature of the interface of 2D catalysts under reaction conditions.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Intra&#8208;Nanopore Charge Microenvironment in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Monovalent Cation Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging intra&#8208;channel charge nature and ion transport: A tunable platform of a series of crystalline COFs with identical frameworks but different intra&#8208;pore charge microenvironments is developed to explore their charge&#8208;driven monovalent cation transport performance and mechanism. Rational tuning of charge properties optimizes host&#8208;guest interactions, enhancing ion pair dissociation, cation mobility, and carrier concentration. Order of transport efficiency: anionic COF &gt; zwitterionic COF &gt; cationic COF &gt; neutral COF. This work offers new insights into the development and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of the next generation of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors.







Abstract
Charged channels are considered an effective design for achieving efficient monovalent cation transport; however, it remains challenging to establish a direct relationship between charge microenvironments and ionic conductivity within the pores. Herein, we report a series of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with identical skeletons but different charge microenvironments and explore their intra&#8208;pore charge&#8208;driven ion transport performance and mechanism differences. We found that the charged nature determines ion&#8208;pair action sites, modes, host&#8208;guest interaction, thereby influencing the dissociation efficiency of ion pairs, the hopping ability of cations, and the effective carrier concentration. The order of transport efficiency for Li+, Na+, and H+ follows anion &gt; zwitterion &gt; cation &gt; neutrality. Ionic COFs exhibit up to 11&#8208;fold higher ionic conductivity than neutral COFs. Notably, the ionic conductivity of anionic COF achieves 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li+ at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for H+ at 160&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing most COF&#8208;based ionic conductors. This COF platform for efficient ion migration and stable battery cycling in lithium&#8208;metal quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries has also been verified as proof of concept. This work offers new insights into the development and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of the next generation of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors.

         <title>Conformational Plasticity and Binding Affinity Enhancement Controlled by Linker Derivatization in Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A link to success: Nature repeatedly used highly functionalized macrocycles to create sophisticated bioactive small molecules. Non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also emerging as drug modalities to tackle challenging, intracellular drug targets but guidelines for their design are still premature. Here we show how subtle linker modifications in macrocycles can refine and improve their conformational plasticity and their properties simultaneously.







Abstract
Macrocycles are abundantly used by nature to enable cell&#8208;permeable bioactive molecules. Synthetic non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also increasingly considered as modalities for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;bind proteins but guidelines for macrocyclization are only beginning to emerge. Macrocycles are thought to constrain the available conformations but also to allow for residual flexibility, the latter being poorly understood. Here we show that even medium&#8208;sized macrocycles display an unexpected high conformational plasticity, even when bound to their protein target. Minor modification of the linker region of macrocycles can shift the conformational ensemble to distinct conformational subclasses, each constituting distinct three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds for further optimization. This led to several new ligands with improved affinity and beneficial physicochemical parameters for the FK506&#8208;binding protein&#8197;51, a promising target for depression, obesity and chronic pain. Importantly, none of the beneficial modifications could have been identified by classical medicinal chemistry as they only work in the macrocyclic context.
Our results show that macrocyclization can do more than keeping loose ends together but rather provide a platform for multiple series of macrocycles with distinct binding modes.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Solid Additive Enables Eco&#8208;friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency and Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green solvent&#8208;processed all&#8208;polymer solar cells utilizing the dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive have achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;%.







Abstract
The optimization of morphology in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives. However, their tendency to remain trapped in the device due to high boiling points leads to performance degradation over time. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the design and synthesis of one dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive featuring mono&#8208;brominated&#8208;asymmetric dithienothiophene (SL&#8208;1). Leveraging the synergistic effects of asymmetric substitution and core structures, fine&#8208;tuning the molecule dipole moment enhancing solid additive interactions with host materials, thereby regulating polymer aggregation and influencing blend morphology during device fabrication. This results in highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and a favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within all&#8208;polymer active layer. Our work achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;% in eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs, significantly outperforming SL&#8208;0 (18.37&#8201;%) and SL&#8208;2 (16.60&#8201;%), both featuring an asymmetric core. Furthermore, SL&#8208;1&#8208;treated all&#8208;PSCs retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2140&#8197;hours of operation, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime reaching 12400&#8197;hours. This represents a significant improvement in stability compared to devices treated with solvent additive (1&#8208;CN), which typically exhibits a T90 lifetime of 700&#8197;hours. Our findings underscore the efficacy of utilizing dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additives as a straightforward and viable strategy for optimizing all&#8208;polymer morphology. SL&#8208;1 represents a promising advancement towards eco&#8208;friendly fabrication and application of high&#8208;efficiency and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The optimization of morphology in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives.

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Arylsulfonylated &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Synthesize Polysulfones &#8211; a &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; Approach</title>

Insert text for Table of Contents here: Radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of aryl migration. This &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; approach enables us to synthesize ABC sequenced regulated polysulfones.







Abstract
Traditionally, &#945;&#8208;olefins have been regarded as non&#8208;homopolymerizable substrates in textbook examples. However, they have the ability to copolymerize with sulfur dioxide, leading to the creation of alternating copolymers. These commodity poly(olefin sulfone)s exhibit a wide array of applications. Nevertheless, the synthesis process involving sulfur dioxide pose considerable hazards and practical difficulties. In this study, we report on the &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;olefin monomers, resulting in the production of ABC sequence&#8208;controlled poly(vinylbenzothiazole&#8208;olefin&#8208;sulfone)s. This unique radical polymerization process is enhanced by 1,4/1,5&#8208;aryl migration, facilitated by the sulfonyl radicals involved in propagation. This demonstrated aryl group migration radical polymerization opens up new possibilities for synthesizing polysulfones with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures, which hold great promise as candidates for innovative polymeric materials.

         <title>Tuning the Acid Hardness Nature of Cu Catalyst for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base theory, this work explores tuning the hardness properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts to enhance nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. By modifying Cu&#8208;based catalyst with BaO, we enhanced improved dynamics for protonation and desorption of key intermediates, achieving 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) in alkaline electrolyte presents a sustainable pathway for energy storage and green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, it remains challenging to obtain high activity and selectivity due to the limited protonation and/or desorption processes of key intermediates. Herein, we propose a strategy to regulate the acid hardness nature of Cu catalyst by introducing appropriate modifier. Using density functional theory calculations, we firstly identified that the BaO&#8208;modified Cu showed optimal Gibbs free energies for key NO3RR steps, including the protonation of *NO and the desorption of *NH3. Experimentally, the BaO&#8208;modified Cu catalyst exhibited 97.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 with a yield rate of 356.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. It could also maintain high activity across a wide range of applied potentials and nitrate substrate concentrations. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Ba species could modulate the local electronic states of Cu, enhance the electron transfer rate, and optimize the adsorption/protonation/desorption processes of the N&#8208;containing intermediates, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>Towards the Stable Chelation of Radioantimony(V) for Targeted Auger Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New kid on the (p) block! The most stable complex of radioantimony yet reported under physiological conditions, [117Sb][Sb(TREN&#8208;CAM)]&#8211;, is demonstrated through a combination of radiochemical and structural studies, in vitro challenges, and in vivo SPECT and PET imaging in mice. These results mark an exciting leap towards implementing the elementally matched pair 117/119Sb in targeted Auger theranostics of cancer.







Abstract
Antimony&#8208;119 (119Sb) is one of the most attractive Auger&#8208;electron emitters identified to date, but it remains practically unexplored for targeted radiotherapy because no chelators have been identified to stably bind this metalloid in vivo. In a departure from current studies focused on chelator development for Sb(III), we explore the chelation chemistry of Sb(V) using the tris&#8208;catecholate ligand TREN&#8208;CAM. Through a combination of radiolabeling, spectroscopic, solid&#8208;state, and computational studies, the radiochemistry and structural chemistry of TREN&#8208;CAM with 1XX/natSb(V) were established. The resulting [1XXSb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM complex remained intact for several days in human serum, signifying high stability under biological conditions. Finally, the first in vivo single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging studies were carried out using 117Sb, the diagnostic analogue of 119Sb. These studies revealed marked differences in the uptake and distribution of activity in mice administered unchelated [117Sb]Sb(OH)6&#8211; versus [117Sb]Sb&#8211;TREN&#8208;CAM, suggesting that 117Sb is largely retained by TREN&#8208;CAM over the time course of the study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the most physiologically stable complex of no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added 1XXSb yet reported, offering new promise for the clinical implementation of radioantimony in nuclear medicine. Our results also establish the feasibility of 117Sb as an elementally matched partner to 119Sb for theranostic applications.

The most stable complex of radioantimony yet reported under physiological conditions, [&lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sb][Sb(TREN-CAM)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;, is demonstrated through a combination of radiochemical and structural studies, in vitro challenges, and in vivo SPECT and PET imaging in mice. These results mark an exciting leap towards implementing the elementally matched pair &lt;sup&gt;117/119&lt;/sup&gt;Sb in targeted Auger theranostics of cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimony-119 (&lt;sup&gt;119&lt;/sup&gt;Sb) is one of the most attractive Auger-electron emitters identified to date, but it remains practically unexplored for targeted radiotherapy because no chelators have been identified to stably bind this metalloid in vivo. In a departure from current studies focused on chelator development for Sb(III), we explore the chelation chemistry of Sb(V) using the tris-catecholate ligand TREN-CAM. Through a combination of radiolabeling, spectroscopic, solid-state, and computational studies, the radiochemistry and structural chemistry of TREN-CAM with &lt;sup&gt;1XX/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Sb(V) were established. The resulting [&lt;sup&gt;1XX&lt;/sup&gt;Sb]Sb&#8211;TREN-CAM complex remained intact for several days in human serum, signifying high stability under biological conditions. Finally, the first in vivo single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging studies were carried out using &lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sb, the diagnostic analogue of &lt;sup&gt;119&lt;/sup&gt;Sb. These studies revealed marked differences in the uptake and distribution of activity in mice administered unchelated [&lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sb]Sb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; versus [&lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sb]Sb&#8211;TREN-CAM, suggesting that &lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sb is largely retained by TREN-CAM over the time course of the study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the most physiologically stable complex of no-carrier-added &lt;sup&gt;1XX&lt;/sup&gt;Sb yet reported, offering new promise for the clinical implementation of radioantimony in nuclear medicine. Our results also establish the feasibility of &lt;sup&gt;117&lt;/sup&gt;Sb as an elementally matched partner to &lt;sup&gt;119&lt;/sup&gt;Sb for theranostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The development of advanced catalysts frequently employs trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods and is lack of highly controlled synthesis, resulting in unsatisfactory development efficiency and performance. Here we propose a data&#8208;driven prediction coupled with precise synthesis strategy to accelerate the development of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for efficient water purification. The data&#8208;driven approach enables the rapid screening and prediction of high&#8208;performance SACs from 43 metals&#8208;N4 structures comprising transition and main group metal elements, followed by validation and structural modulation for improved performance through a highly controllable hard&#8208;template method. Impressively, a well&#8208;designed Fe&#8208;SAC with a high loading of Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites (~3.83&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and highly mesoporous structure, exhibits ultra&#8208;high decontamination performance (rate constant of 100.97&#8197;min&#8722;1 g&#8722;2), representing the best Fenton&#8208;like activities for sulfonamide antibiotics to date. Furthermore, the optimized Fe&#8208;SAC shows excellent robust environmental resistance and cyclic stability with almost 100&#8201;% degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics for 100&#8208;h continuous operation. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Fe&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N4 sites can reduce the energy barrier of intermediate O* formation, the rate&#8208;determining step, resulting in highly selective generation of singlet oxygen. The integration of data&#8208;driven method with precise synthesis strategy provides a novel paradigm for the rapid development of high&#8208;performance catalysts for environmental field as well as other important fields including sustainable energy and catalysis.

         <title>Taming the Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction via Rational Diluent Selection for Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new selection principle based on the diluent selection parameter (DSP, the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+) is proposed for admirable diluent selection. Diluents with larger DSP are more apt to tame ion&#8208;dipole interaction, improving the Li reversibility and low&#8208;temperature stability. This work provides new guidance to develop novel diluents for long&#8208;cycle Li metal batteries.







Abstract
Developing advanced electrolytes with high Li affinity is crucial for achieving long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the strong Li+&#8208;solvent interactions in conventional electrolytes often induce difficult Li+ desolvation especially under low&#8208;temperature conditions, resulting in the formation of fragile electrode interfaces involving solvents, and thus dissatisfactory cycling stability of LMBs. Herein, by introducing various diluents into the lithium hexafluorophosphate in 1, 2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte, we reveal that Li+ desolvation is influenced by not only the diluent&#8208;solvent interaction but also the diluent&#8208;anion interaction. Based on these findings, a diluent selection parameter (DSP), which is calculated based on the product of interaction energies of diluent&#8208;solvent/diluent&#8208;Li+ and diluent&#8208;anion/diluent&#8208;Li+, is proposed for diluent selection. A diluent with a larger DSP is more favorable for promoting Li+ desolvation and improving the low&#8208;temperature performance of LMBs. With the rationally selected 1, 2&#8208;dichloroethane diluent (DSP=3.95), the Li

         <title>Manipulating Dynamic Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition and Static Reversible Photochromism by an Organic Cocrystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a supramolecular assembly strategy for charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal system allows realization of a dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition as well as reversible photochromic behavior, in particular a time&#8208;dependent green&#8208;fading&#8208;yellow fluorescence variation during UV irradiation. These properties allow potential application in photoactivated anti&#8208;counterfeiting functional materials.







Abstract
Developing of molecular crystalline materials with light&#8208;induced multiple dynamic deformation in space dimension and photochromism on time scales has attracted much attention for its potential applications in actuators, sensoring and information storage. Nevertheless, organic crystals capable of both photoinduced dynamic effects and static color change are rare, particularly for multi&#8208;component cocrystal system. In this study, we first report the construction of charge transfer cocrystal allows their light&#8208;induced solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition and photochromic behaviors to be controlled by trans&#8208;stilbene (TSB) as an electron donor and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalonitrile (TFP) as an electron acceptor. In this case, the dynamic photo&#8208;responsive solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition is due to the photoisomerization of TSB under UV light irradiation, while the accumulation of melted droplets during solid&#8208;state photochemical process causes mechanical deformation of TSB&#8208;TFP cocrystals. The subsequent reversible photochromic behavior is attributed to the emergence of free radicals through a photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. Moreover, TSB&#8208;TFP microcrystals present typical excitation wavelength dependent emission (EWDE) fluorescence by surfactant&#8208;mediated method. This work realizes the dynamic&#8208;static photochemical cascade processes in response to UV light irradiation in an organic cocrystal system, providing the effective method for a new type of smart photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Rational Design of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues via 3&#8201;d Transition Metals Incorporation for Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cobalt&#8208;Based Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) as anode materials for SIBs are designed by a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach through the rational incorporation of 3d transition metals. Among them, the CoV&#8208;PBA (CV) anode exhibits remarkable sodium&#8208;ion storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic modulation of its electronic structure through &#960;&#8208;electron regulation induced by vanadium incorporation.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt&#8208;M&#8208;based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM&#8208;PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs via a universal low&#8208;energy co&#8208;precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate p&#8208;band center of cyanide linkages (&#8722;CN&#8722;) is more favorable for Na+ intercalation and diffusion, while the d&#8208;band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM&#8208;based PBAs, CoV&#8208;PBAs possess the best sodium&#8208;ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7&#8197;mAh/g at 30&#8197;A/g). In situ/ex situ techniques further demonstrate that the &#960;&#8208;electron regulation by V introduction enhances the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions.

     alt="Rational Design of Cobalt-Based Prussian Blue Analogues via 3&#8201;d Transition Metals Incorporation for Superior Na-Ion Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Cobalt-Based Prussian blue analogues (CoM-PBAs) as anode materials for SIBs are designed by a universal low-energy co-precipitation approach through the rational incorporation of 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; transition metals. Among them, the CoV-PBA (CV) anode exhibits remarkable sodium-ion storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic modulation of its electronic structure through &#960;-electron regulation induced by vanadium incorporation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt-M-based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM-PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a universal low-energy co-precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-band center of cyanide linkages (&#8722;CN&#8722;) is more favorable for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation and diffusion, while the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM-based PBAs, CoV-PBAs possess the best sodium-ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7&#8197;mAh/g at 30&#8197;A/g). &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;ex situ&lt;/i&gt; techniques further demonstrate that the &#960;-electron regulation by V introduction enhances the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions. Moreover, the study identified the &#8220;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-band center&#8221; and &#8220;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center&#8221; may serve as key descriptors for quantifying the capability and stability of other-type bimetal Co-based anodes (oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) with similar theoretical capacity, offering a potentially transformative approach for selecting practical SIB electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Mechanism of Surface Cationic Vacancy Induces High Activity of Metastable Lattice Oxygen in Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined approach of H3BO3 treatment, followed by water washing and low&#8208;temperature calcination, is proposed to construct a shell with Li vacancies on the surface of Li&#8208;rich layered cathode materials. Encouragingly, the metastable On&#8722; (0&lt;n&lt;2) is also activated. Consequently, the modified Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and Li1.2Ni0.16Co0.08Mn0.56O2 exhibit an initial coulombic efficiency of up to about 88&#8201;%, significantly higher than traditional LMLOs (~70&#8201;%).







Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides exhibit high specific capacity due to the cationic and anionic reaction process during high&#8208;voltage cycling (&#8805;4.6&#8197;V). However, they face challenges such as low initial coulombic efficiency (~70&#8201;%) and poor cycling stability. Here, we propose a combination of H3BO3 treatment and low temperature calcination to construct a shell with cationic vacancy on the surface of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 (LLNMO). The H3BO3 treatment produces cationic vacancy and lattice distortion, forming an oxidized On&#8722; (0&lt;n&lt;2) on the surface, accompanied by electrons redistribution. Low temperature calcination eliminates lattice distortion, activates metastable On&#8722; and promotes coherent lattice formation. In addition, the cationic vacancy shell reduces the diffusion energy barrier of Li+, allowing more Li+ and oxygen to participate in deeper reactions and increasing the oxidation depth of oxygen. The modified material (LLNMO&#8208;H10&#8208;200) exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of up to 88&#8201;% and a capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, similar enhancements were observed with Co&#8208;containing lithium&#8208;rich materials, with a 280&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 discharge capacity and 89&#8201;% coulombic efficiency. These findings reveal the correlation between cationic vacancy, metastable oxygen activation and bulk phase activity, offering a novel approach to enhancing the initial coulombic efficiency and cycle stability of Li&#8208;rich materials.

         <title>The First Kleinman&#8208;type Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Circular Dichroism On/Off Switchable Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics show a ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from the chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 to chiral&#8208;nonpolar 422, which enables the notable switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response from SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) to inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states. Such an on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD effect is unprecedented.







Abstract
Chiral ferroelectrics have recently received considerable interest due to their unique chiroptical properties. They can adopt Kleinman symmetry second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#8208;active chiral&#8208;polar point groups in the ferroelectric phase while Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive chiral&#8208;nonpolar point groups in the paraelectric phase, providing a great opportunity to realize on/off switching of SHG circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. However, the SHG&#8208;CD effect was rarely explored in chiral ferroelectrics, and the on/off switchable SHG&#8208;CD has never been reported. Herein, we report the first crown ether&#8208;based chiral ferroelectrics (R/S&#8208;CS)Ca(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) (CS=camphor&#8208;10&#8208;sulfonic acid), which undergo a 422F2 type ferroelectric phase transition at around 336&#8197;K from Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;active point group 2 to Kleinman symmetry SHG&#8208;inactive point group 422. Notably, they exhibit obvious SHG&#8208;CD responses with an anisotropy factor of up to 0.31. More importantly, the SHG&#8208;CD response can be switched between SHG&#8208;CD active (SHG&#8208;CD on) and inactive (SHG&#8208;CD off) states during the ferroelectric phase transition, which is unprecedented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of Kleinman&#8208;type SHG&#8208;CD on/off switchable ferroelectric. Our findings open up a new way to switch SHG&#8208;CD response based on chiral ferroelectrics, which would greatly inspire the further exploration of switchable SHG&#8208;CD effects in chiral ferroelectrics.

         <title>A C&#8211;H Arylation&#8208;Based Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the synthesis of planar chiral macrocyclophanes via Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation is reported. It relies on the design of new bifunctional ligands showing optimal noncovalent interactions with the substrate, and involves the dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile precursors. The obtained macrocyclophanes show interesting chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Despite the growing importance of planar chiral macrocyclophanes owing to their unique properties in different areas of chemistry, methods that are effective in controlling their planar chirality are restricted to certain molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report the first Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation that induces planar chirality by installing bulky aryl groups through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). A computer&#8208;assisted approach allowed a fine&#8208;tuning of the structure of the employed chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands to achieve high enantioselectivities. A range of planar chiral macrocyclophanes were successfully synthesized from configurationally labile macrocyclic precursors via C&#8722;H arylation with various perfluoroarenes. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction proceeds via reversible oxidative addition and enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation. Selected macrocyclophane products showed interesting photophysical and chiroptical properties, which depended on both the nature of the ansa chains and the aromatic moieties.

         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from A. sinensis APS&#8208;1 II with anti&#8208;leukemia activity has been synthesized for the first time by orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation and stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation strategies. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed that not only the 13&#8208;mer but also a 9&#8208;mer showed anti&#8208;leukemia activity.







Abstract
A polysaccharide APS&#8208;1 II from a medicinal plant Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels represents a potential therapeutic agent against leukemia. However, the synthetic accessibility of the highly branched and complex APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide with multiple 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages remains a difficult task, impeding the in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity relationship biological studies and the development of carbohydrates&#8208;based therapeutics against leukemia. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of tridecasaccharide repeating unit together with shorter sequences 4&#8208;mer, 6&#8208;mer and 9&#8208;mer from APS&#8208;1 II polysaccharide via one&#8208;pot orthogonal glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded the potential issues such as aglycone transfer associated with one&#8208;pot assembly with thioglycosides. The synthetic pathway also features the following aspects: 1)&#8197;three contiguous and challenging 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;Fuc bonds were highly stereoselectively constructed via the newly developed stereoselective 1, 2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosylation method; 2)&#8197;several 1, 2&#8208;trans&#8208;glycosidic linkages were formed via neighboring group participation effect, while 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glc linkage was stereoselectively assembled via N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide reagent modulation; 3) the final [1+1+2+9] one&#8208;pot assembly of the target tridecasaccharide via strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates. Biological studies revealed that human leukemia K562 and mouse L1210&#8197;cells could be effectively inhibited by tridecasaccharide repeating unit and substructure nonasaccharide.

&lt;p&gt;A tridecasaccharide from &lt;i&gt;A. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; APS-1 II with anti-leukemia activity has been synthesized for the first time by orthogonal one-pot glycosylation and stereoselective 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-fucosylation strategies. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that not only the 13-mer but also a 9-mer showed anti-leukemia activity.

&lt;p&gt;A polysaccharide APS-1 II from a medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Angelica sinensis&lt;/i&gt; (Oliv.) Diels represents a potential therapeutic agent against leukemia.

         <title>AA&#8208;Stacked Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacked hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) as the anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion battery prepared by a scalable alcohol&#8208;thermal method. Such unique architecture enables to increase lithium binding sites and to facilitate lithium rapid transfer through the formed well&#8208;organized pore channels, thereby leading to an excellent reversible capacity, rate performance as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) has been considered a promising electrode material for application in electrochemical energy storage. However, studies on GDY featuring an ordered interlayer stacking are lacking, which is supposed to be another effective way to increase lithium binding sites and diffusion pathways. Herein, we synthesized a hydrogen&#8208;substituted GDY (HsGDY) with a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacking structure via a facile alcohol&#8208;thermal method. Such unique architecture enables a rapid lithium transfer through the well&#8208;organized pore channels and endows a stronger adsorption capability to lithium atom as compared to the arbitrarily&#8208;stacked mode. The resultant HsGDY exhibits a reversible capacity of 1040&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 ranking among the most powerful GDY&#8208;based electrode materials, and an excellent rate performance as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability. The successful preparation of gram&#8208;level high&#8208;quality HsGDY products in batches implies the potential for large&#8208;scale lithium&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Additives with an Intrinsic N&#8594;O Acceptor for Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;substituted aromatic pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PNO) containing an N&#8594;O acceptor is reported as a highly effective additive to the ZS electrolyte in ZIBs. This additive is distinct from previously reported organic molecules or salts. The N&#8594;O group acts as an un&#8208;ionized, appropriately polarized ligand&#8208;bonded acceptor, significantly enhancing the cyclic lifetime of ZIBs.







Abstract
Various organic and inorganic reagents containing N/O functional groups have been developed as additives to aqueous electrolytes (e.g., ZnSO4, ZS) of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). However, finding an additive that can significantly enhance the durability of Zn anodes by inhibiting Zn dendrites and side reactions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PNO), a non&#8208;substituted aromatic compound with a nitrogen positive charge&#8208;induced N&#8594;O bond, is explored as ZS additives for highly durable Zn plating/stripping electrolytes (i.e., PNO/ZS). The optimized PNO0.03/ZS mixture demonstrates exceptional stability for Zn anodes, achieving a cycle life exceeding 4200&#8197;h and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It maintains over 1000&#8197;h of life and a cumulative capacity of 2.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even when subjected to plating/stripping conditions intensified by a factor of 5. Importantly, it enables Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cells to sustain high&#8208;current charge/discharge cycles for over 5000 cycles, retaining 80&#8201;% (125&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) of the initial capacity, which is the best performance reported for similar additive systems. This exceptional stability is ascribed to the highly reversible Zn anode plating/stripping, facilitated by the suitable coordination interactions between the N&#8594;O acceptor of PNO and the Zn2+/H2O donor, effectively inhibiting side reactions.

         <dc:description>
A localize high concentration electrolyte (code: E&#8208;SE&#8208;F) with non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity was formulated. Thanks to these features, the safety performance of high energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs) was significantly enhanced. The LHCE also improved the electrochemical performance of LIBs because of its excellent interphasial and interfacial stability.







Abstract
The poor safety performance of high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is drawing increasing public concern. To enhance the safety performance on the battery level, it is indispensable to design safe electrolytes that are both non&#8208;flammable and low exothermic under abusive conditions. By rational design, a safe localize high concentration electrolyte (LHCE) with non&#8208;flammability and extremely low exothermicity is formulated. Compared with conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocabonate electrolytes and previous LHCEs, the heat generated by the reaction between the safe LHCE and fully charged electrodes under abusive conditions is significantly reduced. Because of the non&#8208;flammability and low&#8208;exothermicity of the safe LHCE, high energy density LIB (1800&#8197;mAh Gr||LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, fully charged to 4.3&#8197;V) with the safe LHCE successfully passes the nail penetration test. Because of the excellent interphasial properties of the safe LHCE, the cycle life and the rate capability of high energy density LIBs are significantly improved when the safe LHCE is adopted. This work sheds light on the design principles of electrolytes for achieving battery&#8208;level safety.

This review offers an introduction on the recent development of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs with advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction in terms of the synthetic methods, structure optimization, performance enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
Photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction into high&#8208;value products are promising strategies for addressing both environmental problems and energy crisis. Duo to their advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability, porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as attractive photo/electro&#8208;catalysts towards CO2 reduction. In this review, the research progress of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction is summarized including the design principles, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, this review also presents some challenges and prospects for the application of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs in photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction, laying the base for both fundamental research and application efforts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo/electro-catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into high-value products are promising strategies for addressing both environmental problems and energy crisis. Duo to their advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post-modification capability, and excellent stability, porphyrin-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as attractive photo/electro-catalysts towards CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. In this review, the research progress of the porphyrin-based COFs for photo/electro-catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is summarized including the design principles, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, this review also presents some challenges and prospects for the application of porphyrin-based COFs in photo/electro-catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, laying the base for both fundamental research and application efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Clone&#8208;Resolved Chemical Depletion of T cells via Cellular Proximity Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical strategy of depleting T cells utilizes chemically engineered dendritic cell (DC) &#8208;derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) to destroy targeted T cell clones in close proximity. This strategy enables selective elimination of pathogenic T cell clones without impairing normal T cells, which might serve as a new antigen&#8208;specific approach for blunting autoimmune inflammations.







Abstract
T cells play a pivotal role in the development of autoimmune diseases. To mitigate autoimmune inflammation without inducing global immunosuppression, it is crucial to selectively eliminate autoreactive T cell clones while preserving the normal T cell repertoire. In this study, we applied cellular proximity chemistry to develop a T&#8208;cell depletion method with clonal precision. Using engineered dendritic cells (DCs) with surface&#8208;bound photosensitizers, we generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at immune synapses, leading to the targeted death of antigen&#8208;specific T cells in close proximity. This process induces lipid oxidation in T cell membranes, triggering ferroptosis&#8208;like cell death. The method enables the selective elimination of specific T cell clones without affecting others, in which the clonal resolution was demonstrated by TCR sequencing. Finally, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in a type 1 diabetes model by selectively depleting the pathogenic 8.3 T cell clone, thereby protecting islet &#946; cells and preserving overall T cell function. This strategy offers a promising avenue for immunosuppressive therapy that targets pathogenic T cells while maintaining overall immune integrity.

         <title>Step&#8208;Edge Guided Homoepitaxy Enables Highly Reversible Zn Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal anodes are of profound impact towards the realization of energy&#8208;dense rechargeable batteries. However, the &#8220;hostless&#8221; metal redox always presents the disordered plating/stripping, aggravated by the side reactions&#160;and&#160;local anisotropy&#160;that cause the formation of excessive dendrites/voids and quickly lead to battery failure. Here we report&#160;step&#8208;edge guided&#160;homoepitaxy enabling ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Zn plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. Through engineering the atomic terrace height on the mono&#8208;oriented Zn(0002) foil anodes, both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane epitaxy&#160;aligned to the underlying Zn lattice&#160;are demonstrated&#160;via&#160;the favored edge nucleation and strong interfacial interaction driven by the&#160;surface/interface energy minimization, achieving the electrochemical homoepitaxy of continuous,&#160;submillimeter&#8208;scale&#160;Zn(0002) crystal with nearly 100%&#160;theoretical density.&#160;Accordingly, we achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, high depths&#160;of discharge exceeding 51%&#160;and&#160;82% along with record&#8208;high lifetimes&#160;of over a thousand and hundreds of hours, respectively,&#160;in zinc metal batteries.&#160;The breakthrough results&#160;provide new insights on&#160;the intrinsic metal plating/stripping from the view of reversible&#160;homoepitaxy for rechargeable&#160;energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Selectively Activated Aromatic Rings for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising candidates for anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their designable structure, abundant active sites, and well&#8208;organized porosity. However, the structural factors governing active site utilization and Li&#8208;ion storage kinetics remain inadequately understood. In particular, the Li&#8208;ion storage behaviors of aromatic rings with high LUMO energy levels and situated in varying chemical environments remain a highly debated issue. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;based MOF (Co&#8208;NTTA, NTTA ligand: 5,5&#8242;,5&#8243;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;nitrilotris(benzoyl))tris&#8208;(azanediyl))triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings situated in diverse local environments, is deliberately designed and synthesized. Experimental characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations have verified the occurrence of a reversible electrochemical reaction involving a total of 51 electrons among the NTTA ligands, cobalt cations, and Li+ ions. Unlike the traditional concept of superlithiation, the three inner aromatic rings are selectively activated by &#960;&#8208;aromatic conjugation networks and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, contributing to a reversible 6&#8208;electron pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation reaction. Conversely, the three outer aromatic rings remain inert toward Li+ ions. Impressively, the Co&#8208;NTTA MOF anode, with selectively activated aromatic rings, delivers a reversible capacity of up to 956 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200 mA g&#8722;1 and demonstrates exceptional high&#8208;rate durability, further supporting a 4.3 V lithium&#8208;ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor with high energy/power density.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Catalytic Superlattices for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage with A high Compositional Conversion Degree</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major obstacle of transition metal disulfides in sodium&#8208;ion batteries is compositional irreversible conversion, leading to fast capacity decay. Here, we propose to engineer a catalytic superlattice structure for achieving a record&#8208;high compositional reversible conversion degree (&#8776;100%). The superlattice is constructed by alternately stacking MoS2 layers and nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal layers (MoS2/M&#8208;ONG SL, M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) with 100% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces, in which the metal atoms bridge the two layers through S&#8208;M&#8208;O chemical bonds. Using MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL as a model, the unique superlattice structure shows excellent electron and Na+ transport properties during discharge and charge. Moreover, the Co&#8208;ONG boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by forming Co&#8208;3d and S&#8208;3p hybridization. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL shows a high compositional reversible conversion degree(&#8776;100%), as proven by a series of in&#8208;/ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic analyses. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL exhibits a stable cycling stability of 300.7 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, with an ultrasmall capacity decay rate of 0.41% per 100 cycles. This work offers a noteworthy perspective on the design and fabrication of conversion&#8208;type materials, emphasizing the crucial role of interface engineering in achieving excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Polyhedral Chalcogenaboranes: Activation without breaking Wade's Rules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the first cationic chalcogenaboranes having the same skeletal electron pair count as their neutral precursors but bearing a positive charge. This is in contrast with Wade's rules, which claim that a change in the shape or number of skeletal electron pairs is inevitable. The enhanced electrophilicity of these compounds is demonstrated by their reactivity with weak bases.







Abstract
Wade's rules are a well&#8208;established tool for the description of the geometry of inorganic clusters. Among others, they state that a decrease or increase in charge is always accompanied by a change in the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs). This work reports the synthesis of the first cationic chalcogenaboranes closo&#8208;[12&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;IPr&#8208;1&#8208;EB11H10]BF4 (IPr=1,3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; X=H, I; E=S, Se 3&#8201;a/b, 4&#8201;a/b) featuring the same SEP count as their neutral precursors, EB11H11, but bearing a positive charge. This ionisation significantly enhances the activity towards the electrophiles. It unlocks reactivity with very weak bases and offers the control of the regioselectivity towards hard/soft bases by the modulation of LUMO. The localisation of the positive charge within the borane cluster has been confirmed experimentally, spectroscopically and theoretically.

This work reports the synthesis of the first cationic chalcogenaboranes &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-[12-X-2-IPr-1-EB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (IPr=1,3-(2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-imidazole-2-ylidene; X=H, I; E=S, Se &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/b&lt;/b&gt;) featuring the same SEP count as their neutral precursors, EB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, but bearing a positive charge. This ionisation significantly enhances the activity towards the electrophiles. It unlocks reactivity with very weak bases and offers the control of the regioselectivity towards hard/soft bases by the modulation of LUMO. The localisation of the positive charge within the borane cluster has been confirmed experimentally, spectroscopically and theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction on M3N@C80 (M = Lu, Sc): Reactivity and Reversibility Enable Chemical Separation of Metallofullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endohedral metallofullerenes are chemically more inert compared to empty fullerenes, primarily due to their intramolecular electron transfer. In this work, we report an inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@C80 (M= Lu, Sc), where they show significantly higher reactivity than empty fullerenes. The molecular structures of the [4+2] cycloadducts were unambiguously characterized. Moreover, the cycloadducts can fully revert to pristine M3N@C80 via retro&#8208;cycloaddition upon thermal treatment. With the unusual reactivity and reversibility, the IEDDA reaction enables an effective separation approach for metallofullerenes from their soot extracts, opening path to efficient and economical scale&#8208;up synthesis of metallofullerenes in laboratory and industrial settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea Complete Conversion to Compound Fertilizer in Industrial&#8208;scale Tandem Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A compound fertilizer with NH4H2PO4 and KH2PO4 offer significant advantages in enhancing both crop yield and quality. Ammonia (NH&#8323;) is essential for the synthesis of the compound fertilizer, which was produced by an energy intensive chemical process. Developing efficient and environmental friendly methods to produce ammonia&#8208;containing compound fertilizers is crucial and extremely challenging. Here, we present a tandem catalysis system capable of achieving complete conversion of abundant urea into compound fertilizer in industrial&#8208;scale reactors by combining electrochemical and subsequent chemical processes. In a typical cycle, with the use of 200 g urea, 1580 g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) and 232 L of pure H2 are produced without any further separation process. The key to the realization of this system is to precisely control the rate of urea consumption and NO2&#8208; formation in electrochemical process. By maintaining a precise molar concentration ratio of urea to NO2&#8208; at &#189; in electrolyte, urea can completely react with NO2&#8208; to form N2, while CNO&#8208; can be converted into NH4+ to form compound fertilizer in the second step of H3PO4 treatment, achieving complete conversion of urea without by&#8208;products formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nondirected and Regioselective Arylation of Internal Alkenes with Simple Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective functionalization of internal alkenes has become a highly efficient approach for preparing stereochemically defined multi&#8208;substituted olefins. Unlike traditional methods that require directing groups, activating groups, or active chemical bonds (e.g., halide, pseudo halide, organometallic reagent, etc.), there remains a strong demand for nondirected and selective functionalization of unactivated alkenes with simple coupling partners, both in academic research or industrial applications. Herein, we report the development of a pyridone&#8208;oxazoline (Pyoox) type ligand that combines the features of both pyridone and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline in assisting Pd&#8208;catalyzed olefination. This ligand enables the activation of simple (hetero)arenes and internal alkenes within a single reaction system. A nondirected and regioselective arylation from simple raw materials has been achieved, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted olefins in moderate to excellent yields, with excellent regio&#8208;/stereocontrol. Experimental and computational studies on mechanisms offer insight into the distinctive properties and performance of this ligand&#8208;promoted catalysis. The synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the simplified synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction&#160;over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin&#160;with Triethanolamine as&#160;a&#160;CO2&#160;Shuttle</title>

         <dc:description>Delivering&#160;CO2&#160;molecules to catalyst sites is a vital step in&#160;the&#160;CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR). Achievements have been made to develop efficient catalysts, but few efforts have been dedicated to improving CO2&#160;delivering&#160;in solutions. Herein, we report on&#160;electrocatalytic&#160;CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion&#160;using&#160;Fe tetraphenylporphyrin&#160;(FeTPP)&#160;as a catalyst and&#160;triethanolamine&#160;as a CO2&#160;shuttle.&#160;Compared to ethanol,&#160;the electrocatalytic CO2RR current with triethanolamine increases by more than three times.&#160;We show that triethanolamine can effectively capture a CO2&#160;molecule to form a&#160;zwitterionic alkylcarbonate&#160;through the collaboration between its tripodal alcohol and amine units.&#160;This alkylcarbonate can release the bound CO2&#160;molecule for activation at the Fe site upon its interaction with FeTPP. In addition to shuttling CO2, alkylcarbonates&#160;can also provide protons to assist the C&#8211;O bond cleavage. Therefore, this work is significant to demonstrate a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR by shuttling CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;deposition Treatment of Sb2Se3 Enables Defect Passivation and Increased Carrier Transport Dimension for Efficient Solar Cell Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P2O5 can serve as a post&#8208;deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P2O5 can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep&#8208;level anti&#8208;site defect (SbSe) to a shallower defect (PSe), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P&#8208;doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb4Se6)n, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low&#8208;dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50% in thermal evaporation derived Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep&#8208;level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low&#8208;dimensional solar cell materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Zn and MoS2 Tailored Co&#8208;N/C Environments Enabling Bifunctional ORR/OER Electrocatalysis for Advanced Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To better adapt lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo&#8208;N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co&#8208;N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8208;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo&#8208;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8208;N/C. In Li&#8208;O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn's environmental adaptability and MoS2's encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8208;N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8208;O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01 V, an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 25,026 mAh g&#8208;1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To better adapt lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo-N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co-N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co-N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo-N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo-N/C. In Li-O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn's environmental adaptability and MoS2's encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo-N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li-O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01 V, an ultra-high specific capacity of 25,026 mAh g-1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single-atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium-oxygen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polar Three&#8208;dimensional Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Realize Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;driven Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) triggered by spontaneous polarization in polar organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has brought unprecedented development opportunities for self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection. However, the currently reported ultraviolet optoelectronic devices are dominated by low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, in which low carrier mobility limits the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time a polar three&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, namely MHyPbBr3 (1, MHy = methylhydrazine), that achieves high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven ultraviolet photodetection.  Benefitting from the large spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconductor attributes, 1 exhibits 0.33 V BPVE and  high carrier mobility lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) of 1.972 &#205; 10&#8208;3 cm&#8208;2 V&#8208;1 under ultraviolet illumination. Notably, such merits contribute to efficient self&#8208;driven photodetection, where responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) reach up to 198 mA W&#8208;1 and 1.42 &#205; 1013 Jones, surpassing most reported ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, based on the reversible phase transition of 1, we have achieved controllable ultraviolet photoelectric detection. This work will shed light on the fabrication of high&#8208;response self&#8208;driven ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Li&#8211;CO2  Battery Performance via High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts: Insights into Configurational Entropy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention for their ability to combine CO2 fixation and conversion with high&#8208;density energy storage. However, sluggish kinetics of CO2 reduction and evolution reactions at cathodes lead to large overpotential and poor cyclic stability. To address this issue, it is critical to develop advanced cathode catalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), a new class of catalysts, have exhibited exceptional catalytic activities in various electrochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the intrinsic relationship between mix configurational entropy (&#8710;Smix) and catalytic properties of HEAs remains unclear. Herein, we prepared a series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different &#8710;Smix values supported on carbon nanofibers as cathode catalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Experimental and computational results reveal a positive correlation between &#8710;Smix and catalytic activity, attributed to charge redistribution among elements with different electronegativities. The Li&#8211;CO2 battery using the alloy catalyst with the maximum &#8710;Smix value delivers the largest capacity of 6160 mAh g&#8208;1, the lowest charge potential plateau below 4.0 V, and remarkable cycling stability (550 cycles/5500 h), surpassing most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, fabrication of pouch cells with low noble metal loading demonstrates the practical potential of HEAs for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. This work provides insights into high&#8208;entropy engineering for advanced electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Reagent for Mild and Stereospecific Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A user&#8208;friendly reagent for mild and general activation of alcohols towards bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) leveraging diverse nucleophiles, including primary and secondary amines is reported herein. The new ion&#8208;paired reagent discovery was based upon the putative zwitterionic betaine intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction and enabled the one&#8208;step conversion of enantioenriched alcohols to valuable chiral C&#8211;X bonds (where X = N, C, S, O or halide). The described activating reagent has also been applied to a one&#8208;step methylation reaction using methanol and to an intermolecular amination/intramolecular cyclization sequence that generates heterocycles, such as tetrahydroisoquinolines. This work provides the first evidence by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a protonated betaine as intermediate in the Mitsunobu reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the meta&#8208;position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the meta&#8208;hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza&#8208;arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3&#8208;position of these dienamine&#8208;type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic conversion of Carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for addressing the CO2 emission problem. However, several issues still need to be resolved to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic reaction. Perovskites possess superior light absorption capacity, tunable band gap, high defect tolerance, and diverse dimensionality. Among them, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are more stable under photocatalytic conditions and have an exciting excitonic characteristics compared to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites. 2D perovskites have unique physical and chemical properties, such as, high stability, polaron formation, quantum well structures, and high exciton binding energies, which remain underexplored for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (pCO2RR). Tuning of these properties is easier in 2D perovskites than 3D perovskites by varying the layer thickness and spacer cations. Therefore, 2D perovskites photocatalysts are emerging as promising materials for reducing CO2 into valuable products. This review discusses the classification and synthesis methods for 2D perovskites, the unique properties that make it favorable for photocatalysis, and recent advances in applying 2D perovskites for pCO2RR by monitoring the operational methodology. It also emphasizes potential for future developments in photocatalysis using 2D perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Essential Role of Consecutive Protonation Steps in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction when Using Au Nanorods in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process (PCET) plays a crucial role in both natural and artificial photosynthesis, including CO2 fixation chemistry. However, difficulties in capturing the transient intermediates generated during the protonation process impedes the clarification of the fundamental mechanism behind photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Herein, we report a general killing two birds with one stone strategy by spatially confining Au nanorods within a typical porphyrin MOF (Au@PCN&#8208;222). Interestingly, 2.4&#8208;fold increase in CH4/CO selectivity and 12&#8208;fold increase in CH4 production were observed after loading of Au nanorods, indicative of a strengthened protonation process in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. More importantly, the plasmonic effect from Au nanorods simultaneously boosted the in&#8208;situ Raman signals of *CO and *CHO intermediates on the Au&#8208;O&#8208;Zr active site. The evident protonation process was further clarified in a control H/D kinetic isotope experiment. This work highlights the significance of successive protonation steps for boosting CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable solar fuels is a promising strategy for addressing energy crises and mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the challenge of efficiently regulating photogenerated electrons to CO2 active sites remains a key hurdle for high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction. Herein, a embedded functional group, ether group is introdcuced into porphyrin&#8208;triazine COFs to regulate the transfer behavior of photogenerated electrons. The ether&#8208;embedded COFs (TOT&#8208;TAPP, BOD&#8208;TAPP and QOB&#8208;TAPP) demonstrates significantly faster charge transport and higher photoactivity compared with the corresponding non&#8208;ether&#8208;embedded counterpart COFs. The theoretical calculations and in situ characterizations reveal that the ether group could not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, but also lead to a more substantial accumulation of electrons at the CO2 adsorption region (C=N imine bond), thus greatly promoting the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformal Reconstruction and Dual&#8208;Vacancy Engineering Breaks Kinetics Limitations for Energetic Aqueous Dual&#8208;Cation Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient aqueous energy storage with non&#8208;metallic ions is highly desired but challenged by achieving kinetically favorable surface/interface storage chemistry. Herein, by refining the surface proton environment, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with hydrogen&#8208;aluminum dual vacancies and 3D diffusion channels are demonstrated upon conformal surface reconstruction. An energetic NH4+/H+ dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry is enabled, leading to a remarkable gravimetric specific capacity of up to 604 mAh g&#8208;1 and long&#8208;cycle stability. Combining in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we reveal and visualize the conformal reconstruction process and the reversible dual&#8208;cation storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the dual&#8208;vacancy coupling helps the dissolution of inert Al from LDH for enriching active sites. At the same time, the residual Al shows the pining effect on the [MnO6] octahedron to restrain the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion. The manganese sites adjacent to Al vacancies promote the adsorption of NH4+/H+ and the H vacancies facilitate the adsorption of NH4+, responsible for an optimal dual&#8208;cation storage chemistry. This work demonstrates how the dual vacancies emerge to modulate the carrier migration and thereby the capacity, providing a viable solution of surface/interface optimization for efficient aqueous energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Alkaline Microenvironments Enhanced upon Tip Effects for Efficient Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>he electrochemical disinfection mechanism primarily relies on a high&#8208;voltage pulsed electric field and electrocatalytic generation of highly oxidative radicals but suffers from shortcomings of either high voltages (dozens of kV) or significant gas supply. This study proposes an in&#8208;situ electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8208;12 mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8208;0.5 V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H3O+) from the solution during H2 evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&#8208;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&#8208;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire&#8208;derived tip&#8208;enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&#8208; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 10&#8311; CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8208;0.5 V. The resulting increase in OH&#8208;&#160;concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.</dc:description>

The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H3O+) from the solution during H2 evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH-) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH-, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Solid&#8208;Electrochemical Synthesis: A General Method for Large Scale Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Metal loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal Dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) method was proposed to fabricate single atom catalysts with high metal loadings. A unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to individual metal atoms via a homolytic cleavage of metal precursors by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings are highly desirable but still challenging for large scale synthesis. Here we report a new technique named as dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) for a general large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs with high metal loadings in an energy&#8208;conservation and environment&#8208;friendly way. With it, a series of pure carbon&#8208;supported metal SACs (Platinum up to 35.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Iridium 21.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Ruthenium 20.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% and Iron 17.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with high metal loadings were obtained. Particularly, a Pt SAC with Pt 23.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% and remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in fuel cells is synthesized on kilogram scale. Based on multiple control experiments, a unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to metals via a homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;halogen bonds by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase. Such versatile technique paves a new economical and environment&#8208;friendly pathway for fabricating high&#8208;metal&#8208;loading SACs or atomic dispersion catalysts.

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;immolative Hydrogen Sulfide Donor for Inflammatory Response&#8208;Specific Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor AlaCOS could undergo a self&#8208;immolative process once activated by aminopeptidase N, an inflammatory biomarker, to generate H2S via carbonyl sulfide (COS), showing potent capacity to reduce cellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response. By reprogramming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, this compound could accelerate wound healing significantly.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays crucial inflammatory modulating roles, representing a promising candidate for anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies. However, current H2S delivery approaches lack sufficient specificity against inflammatory response. Herein, regarding the overexpressed aminopeptidase N (APN) at the inflammation sites, an APN&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative carbonyl sulfide (COS)/H2S donor (AlaCOS) was developed for inflammatory response&#8208;specific H2S delivery. The compound showed sustained H2S generation upon APN activation in the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA), and the responsiveness could be well regulated by modulating the amino acid sequence. Due to the inflammatory response&#8208;specific sustained H2S delivery, AlaCOS provided potent anti&#8208;inflammatory capability, which was further validated by RNA sequencing. In vivo experiments on a full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wound murine model also showed the strong promoting effect on wound healing, mainly due to the regulation of the inflammatory response by AlaCOS. By introducing a caged coumarin fluorophore to the molecular architecture, self&#8208;reporting fluorescence could be generated accompanied with APN&#8208;mediated COS/H2S release, which achieved the visualization of H2S delivery in vitro and in vivo. This work not only offers a useful tool for studying the bioactivity of H2S on inflammation, but also provides new insights for developing novel therapies to cope with inflammation&#8208;associated diseases.

Due to the inflammatory response-specific sustained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S delivery, &lt;b&gt;AlaCOS&lt;/b&gt; provided potent anti-inflammatory capability, which was further validated by RNA sequencing. In vivo experiments on a full-thickness cutaneous wound murine model also showed the strong promoting effect on wound healing, mainly due to the regulation of the inflammatory response by &lt;b&gt;AlaCOS&lt;/b&gt;. By introducing a caged coumarin fluorophore to the molecular architecture, self-reporting fluorescence could be generated accompanied with APN-mediated COS/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release, which achieved the visualization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S delivery in vitro and in vivo. This work not only offers a useful tool for studying the bioactivity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on inflammation, but also provides new insights for developing novel therapies to cope with inflammation-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalysts Derived from Water&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Aerogel for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) aerogels is relatively scarce, primarily constrained by the limited availability of synthetic methods. Herein, a water&#8208;induced rapid conversion process of MOF powder to MOF aerogel is demonstrated, where the macroscopic transition is essentially due to the reassembly of microscopic constituent units and the rapid alteration of morphological structure. The derived catalyst possesses abundant holes left by the acid leaching process, leading to the high enrichment of O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites on the concomitant carbon edges. Consequently, such a catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, only requiring a low overpotential of 279 mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the reduced OER energy barrier over the edge&#8208;enriched O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites, as compared with internal O&#8208;coordinated sites and traditional N&#8208;coordinated sites. This is primarily attributed to the optimization effect of distinctive O&#8208;coordinated structure and synergistic edge effect on the electronic structure of active Ni centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Soluble Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Lithiophilic Modulator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two new COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile solution processing technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries, which can be utilized as artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase to protect lithium metal anode. Highly improved cycling performance of 5000&#8197;h cycling for symmetric cell and up to 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500 cycles for LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as the potential alternative of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, severe instability and safety problems caused by the dendrite growth and inevitable side reactions have hindered the commercialization of LMBs. To solve them, in this contribution, a design strategy of soluble lithiophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is proposed. By introducing polyethylene glycol as the side chains, two COFs (CityU&#8208;28 and CityU&#8208;29) not only become soluble for the facile coating technique, but also can facilitate the lithium&#8208;ion migration in batteries. Furthermore, when coated on the lithium anode of LMB, both COFs can act as artificial solid electrolyte interphase to prevent dendrite growth thus enabling the long&#8208;term stability of the cells. Notably, the symmetric CityU&#8208;29@Li cell can work for more than 5000&#8197;h at a current density of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an areal capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A remarkable capacity retention of 78.9&#8201;% after 1500&#8197;cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of about 99.9&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;C can also be realized in CityU&#8208;29@Li||LiFePO4 full cell. This work could provide a universal design strategy for soluble COFs and enlighten their application in diverse scenarios, especially energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Y with Aluminophosphate as the Aluminum Carrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum Carrier for High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Synthesis. Inspired by the kinetical&#8208;controlled drug delivery, a unique approach based on the controlled aluminum&#8208;incorporation mechanism is proposed to synthesize the most siliceous zeolite Y under organic&#8208;free condition. The introduction of aluminophosphate as Al carrier regulates crystallization kinetics of zeolite Y, which exhibits an improved hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance in benchmark reaction.







Abstract
The wide application of zeolite Y in petrochemical industry is well&#8208;known as one of the milestones in zeolite chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. However, the traditional organic&#8208;free synthesis typically produces (hydro)thermally unstable zeolite Y with Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) less than 2.5. Inspired by drug delivery process in which active components are kinetically controlled released, we develop a unique approach based on the pre&#8208;synthesized aluminum carrier to prepare one of the most siliceous zeolite Y with SAR up to 3.44 without using organics. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates serve as the ideal carrier for the controlled incorporation of Al into zeolite framework during zeolite Y crystallization. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the partial introduction of aluminophosphate as Al source would rationally regulate the crystallization kinetics, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y with random Al distribution. This approach enhances the hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance of zeolite Y in benchmark reaction.

         <title>Unconventional Interconnected High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanodendrites for Remarkably Efficient C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage toward Complete Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy nanodendrites are successfully designed and show excellent ethanol oxidation activity, long&#8208;term stability, resistance to CO poisoning and efficient C1 pathway. The combined effect of intrinsically active Pt, Fe/Co/Ni/Cu in synergy for OHads formation, and Ir/Rh for C&#8722;C bond scission serves to favor C1 pathway over sluggish C2 pathway.







Abstract
Developing ethanol oxidation electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, durability, and resistance to CO poisoning remains a major challenge. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique physical and chemical properties have garnered substantial attention. Herein, a class of HEA nanodendrites are designed by a simple wet&#8208;chemical method. The mass activity and specific activity of the septenary PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst are 2.13&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1/1.05&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ir+Rh&#8722;1 and 2.95&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which reach 5.76&#8208;/2.84&#8208;fold and 5.57&#8208;fold improvements relative to commercial Pt/C (0.37&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 0.53&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. Remarkably, after the i&#8208;t test of up to 100,000&#8201;s and the accelerated durability test of 1500&#8197;cycles, 81.22&#8201;% and 68.54&#8201;% of the initial mass activity are well retained, respectively. The lattice distortion&#8208;associated local tensile strain as demonstrated by increased Pt&#8722;Pt bond length enhances ethanol adsorption and reduces reaction barriers. Moreover, hysteresis diffusion effect induced by lattice distortion in the HEA nanodendrites contributes to their superb ethanol oxidation stability. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the three HEA nanodendrites mainly follow C1 pathway with C&#8722;C bond breaking to form CO followed by CO oxidation especially at a wide range of high potentials. Theoretical calculations reveal that among these HEAs, PtIrRhCoFeNiCu possesses the lowest energy barrier for C&#8722;C bond scission due to synergy among Pt/Ir/Rh and water dissociation due to synergy among Co/Fe/Ni/Cu. This work provides insights to design unique HEA nanostructures with extraordinary catalytic performances and selectivity compared to conventional nanoparticles.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Electron Leakage via An Artificial Rectified Layer for Longevous Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an artificial rectified layer with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features to inhibit electron leakage and homogenize ion/electron fields at the electrolyte/Zn anode interface, preventing the Zn anode from side reactions but promoting its (002) oriented deposition at high utilization and efficiency.







Abstract
Dendrites and water&#8208;induced side reactions impose greatly challenge on the implementation of aqueous zinc ion batteries. To tackle these problems, an artificial rectified layer (ARL) with hydrophobic, zincophilic and insulating features was in situ synthesized on Zn surface rapidly to prevent the electron leakage from Zn anode to aqueous electrolyte, which is the underlying logic for uneven Zn deposition and parasitic side reactions. The ARL also displays a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.71 and can build fast Zn2+ transport channels to homogenize the interfacial ion flux and electric field according to the calculated work function and multi&#8208;physics phase simulation results. Therefore, the Zn anode with ARL shows preferred plating along with (002) crystal facet and an admirable Coulombic efficiency of 99.86&#8201;% over 3200 cycles. Zn symmetric cells can withstand large current density up to 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operate stably at 44.2&#8201;% depth of discharge for 250&#8197;hours, surpassing most of published reports. The ARL also enables the Zn||MnO2 full batteries to circulate over 2600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This work provides a different perspective to comprehend and design satisfactory solid electrolyte interphase for Zn metal anodes.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a liquid membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biology has mastered energy transduction, converting energy between various forms, and employing it to drive its vital processes. Central to this is the ability to use chemical energy for the active transport of substances, pumping ions and molecules across hydrophobic lipid membranes between aqueous (sub)cellular compartments. Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel&#8208;to&#8208;waste (i.e., substrate&#8208;to&#8208;product) conversion results in catalysis&#8208;driven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a liquid hydrophobic membrane, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that transmembrane active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis&#8208;driven active transport and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8216;Tearing Effect&#8217; of Alloy&#8211;Support Interaction for Alloy Redispersion in NiRu/TiO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported alloy catalysts have been extensively applied to many significant industrial chemical processes due to the abundant active sites with distinguishable geometry and electron states. However, a detailed in&#8208;situ investigation of the interaction between support and alloy nanoparticles is still lacking. Here, a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles is in&#8208;situ discovered by environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) with a dramatic redispersion process of alloy nanoparticles from ~25 nm to 2&#8208;3 nm under the repeated hydrogen reduction. Dual&#8208;driven by the distinct alloy&#8208;support interaction involving the restructuring of alloy nanoparticles and growth of TiOx overlayer, larger NiRu alloy nanoparticles spontaneously disintegrate into atoms migrating on support. Atoms are finally captured by the defects generated on TiO2 during the repeat reduction, which also confines the further growth of the newly alloy nanoparticles. Owing to this specific alloy&#8208;support interaction, smaller alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 support are much more stable than the bigger ones, which holds promise for industrial applications as durable catalysts. This novel metal&#8208;support interaction with the &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; revealed on supported alloy catalysts provides new knowledge on the structure&#8208;performance relationships in all the alloy catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combustion of nitrogen&#8208;containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen&#8208;rich fertilizers is accumulating NOx pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NOx remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface. Starting from a molecular tricuprous &#181;3&#8208;oxo complex (1), an unusually reduced and highly reactive surface&#8208;like cluster (2) has been prepared. Characterization data and electronic structure calculations are consistent with 2 featuring &#963;&#8208;aromaticity that primes the tricopper core for two&#8208;electron chemistry. Cluster 2 mediates catalytic reductive coupling of NO to N2, proceeding through N2O,&#160;via sequential oxygen atom transfer steps.

         <title>Multiple Deuterium Atom Transfer Perdeuteration of Unactivated Alkenes under Base&#8208;Assisted Cobalt/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis is described. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. Base&#8208;assisted cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis promoted a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of alkenes to afford deuterated alkenes via multiple repeating deuterium atom transfer/hydrogen atom abstraction processes, while consecutive reductive deuteration of alkenes proceeded in the absence of a base to afford polydeuterated alkanes. One&#8208;pot hydrogenative perdeuteration and perdeutero&#8208;arylation were also developed, providing access to various polydeuterated aliphatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Stable and Sterically Hindered Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium Modification of FAPbI3 Enhances the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films frequently exhibit structural defects and impurities that impede the durable operation of solar cells. In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin&#8208;coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The BCPDAI&#8208;treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI&#8208;modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability.

In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1,3-diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin-coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;-FAPbI3 into a two-dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;-FAPbI3. The BCPDAI-treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI-modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high positive charge density of BCPDA2+ confers greater binding energy at the perovskite surface and elevates the diffusion activation energy of the iodide anion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Creation of dopant&#8208;plasmon synergism in double perovskites for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical synthesis of bromohydrins and hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of photoexcited charge carriers into the synthesis of valuable chemicals offers substantial sustainability benefits, particularly by replacing toxic and costly oxidants and reductants typically used in conventional processes. The efficiency of such transformations is fundamentally governed by the ability to optimize light absorption and charge carrier dynamics within photoelectrodes/photocatalysts. Herein, we present a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;substituted double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 photoanode, embedded with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles, for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical production of bromohydrins and H2O2. Spectroscopic analyses, coupled with three&#8208;dimensional finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations, demonstrate that the inclusion of Ag nanoparticles significantly enhances electromagnetic energy utilization and improves carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the Cu2+ and Ag nanoparticles results in a 7&#8208;fold increase in the yield of 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol, compared to pristine Cs2AgBiBr6, alongside an impressive H2O2 productivity of 25.8 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu2+ substitution strengthens Br&#8722; adsorption and oxidation, promoting the bromohydroxylation of alkenes via electrophilic addition in the bulk solution. These findings offer critical insights into the design of advanced metal halide perovskites for sustainable and solar&#8208;driven chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Circular Polarized Luminescence and Long Persistent Luminescence in Cu8 Cage&#8208;Like Clusters via Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper clusters with diverse luminescent properties are of particular interest. In this study, a series of Cu8 clusters with cage&#8208;like structures was synthesized and characterized. By employing a stepwise ligand engineering strategy that progressively introduced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties, we successfully synthesized R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8208;Cl, the first copper cluster to demonstrate both CPL and LPL. The CPL originates from the chiral metal core induced by the chiral alkynyl ligand, whereas the LPL is attributed to the inherent properties of chlorine&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine, which is retained and modified after ligation. The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film containing Cu8 clusters displays lifetimes of up to 75.18 ms at room temperature and an afterglow exceeding 1.5 s, marking the longest luminescent lifetime recorded for molecular copper&#8208;cluster&#8208;based materials known to date. Additionally, R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8208;Cl shows excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence and variations in luminescence when UV light is switched on and off, highlighting its potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. This work not only presents innovative cage&#8208;like copper cluster structures but also offers new approaches for designing multifunctional clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Carbon Quantum Dot Spacers as Dual Proton/Electron Boosters to Upgrade TiO2@Polydopamine Photocatalysts for pH&#8208;resilient Conversion of O2 into H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, which is generally jeopardized by the kinetic mismatch between photogenerated electron transfer and proton supply. To address the challenge, here we proposed a new core&#8208;shell design of nanocomposite catalysts comprising of carbon quantum dot (CD)&#8208;topped TiO2 nanoparticles encapsulated by polydopamine (PDA) shells, which delivered stable catalytic activity across a pH range of 1 &#8211; 9, exhibiting a photocatalytic generation rate of H2O2 that reached 18.14 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in methanol and 8.66 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in water. This extraordinary, pH&#8208;tolerant photocatalytic generation of H2O2 was benefited from the innovative use of CDs, interspaced between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, not only as a reservoir of protons to buffer the local acidic microenvironment but also as a proton/electron dual booster to sustain an excellent kinetic match between the proton and photogenerated electron transfer, thus enabling the O2 reduction to selectively proceed via two&#8208;electron reaction pathway over a wide pH span.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of Organic Molecules via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O, as well as N&#8208;O and C&#8208;X bonds is successfully achieved without the use of solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders via ball milling. A variety of catalysts are electroplated onto the walls of the milling vessel, allowing for simple recycling and reuse of the catalytic material. Hydrogen gas is directly introduced into the milling vessel, eliminating the need for hydrogen donor compounds which contribute to waste production and suboptimal atom economy. This approach enables the quantitative hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, achieving near&#8208;complete conversion within just 20 minutes at ambient temperature and pressures as low as 1.5 bar. Carbonyls, nitro groups, and organohalides were converted within reaction times of up to 12&#160;hours. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reaction to be following established mechanisms for hydrogenation. Finally, chemoselective hydrogenation of various reducible functional groups was explored, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical approach with simple catalyst recycling for hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Targeting Layer on Silver Nanowire Electrodes Achieving Efficiency Breakthroughs in ITO&#8208;Free Conventional Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes, known for their intrinsic flexibility and tunable optoelectronic properties, have garnered considerable attention for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in conventional OSCs, their low work function (WF) causes energy&#8208;level mismatches with classic aqueous hole transport layers (HTLs), while their poor hydrophilicity hinders the formation of optimized HTL morphology and crystallinity, posing challenges to their integration into high&#8208;performance OSCs. To address these issues, functionally targeted molecules with a thiol group at one end and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing, hydrophilic functional groups at the other are precisely engineered to wrap around the AgNW electrodes. The thiol group facilitates the formation of robust self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) on the AgNW electrodes through stable S&#8208;Ag chemical bonds at room temperature. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups generate notable molecular and interfacial dipoles that effectively raise the WF of AgNW electrodes. Notably, the hydrophilic groups not only improve electrode wettability but also promote strong hydrogen bonding interactions with HTL, leading to substantial improvements in the morphology and crystallinity of the HTL. This precision wrapping strategy enables the fabrication of high&#8208;efficient conventional flexible OSCs, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 18.84% (certified at 18.56%) for flexible OSCs based on ITO&#8208;free transparent electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into Co&#8208;Catalytic Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Support Interactions for Boosting Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with abundant electrocatalytic centers has been identified as the most desirable strategy to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, the co&#8208;contribution from SAC and its support via their interactions for accelerating the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) has so far received little attention, since the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculations, Cobalt&#8208;SACs supported on a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (Co&#8208;GCN), are selected to elucidate the co&#8208;catalytic role in enhancing the SRR. The inherent high charge polarity of GCN, combined with its unique tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine structure, offers multiple binding sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through Li&#8208;N bonds, as well as N/C&#8208;coordinated frameworks for anchoring Co&#8208;SACs. This structural configuration further amplifies the interaction with LiPSs via Co&#8208;S bonds. Consequently, both Co&#8208;SACs and GCN actively participate in sulfur reduction electrocatalysis by binding LiPS intermediates, lowering the conversion energy barrier of SRR. Benefitting from such unique synergy, the battery demonstrates outstanding rate performance (718.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5.0 C) and yields a high areal capacity of up to 13.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 (1584.3 mAh g&#8208;1) under a high areal sulfur loading of 8.7 mg cm&#8208;2 but a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.0 &#956;L mg&#8208;1.</dc:description>

The inherent high charge polarity of GCN, combined with its unique tri-s-triazine structure, offers multiple binding sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through Li-N bonds, as well as N/C-coordinated frameworks for anchoring Co-SACs. This structural configuration further amplifies the interaction with LiPSs via Co-S bonds. Consequently, both Co-SACs and GCN actively participate in sulfur reduction electrocatalysis by binding LiPS intermediates, lowering the conversion energy barrier of SRR. Benefitting from such unique synergy, the battery demonstrates outstanding rate performance (718.9 mAh g-1 at 5.0 C) and yields a high areal capacity of up to 13.8 mAh cm-2 (1584.3 mAh g-1) under a high areal sulfur loading of 8.7 mg cm-2 but a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.0 &#956;L mg-1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing a Carboxyl&#8208;Anhydride Molecular Switch&#8208;Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End&#8208;of&#8208;Use PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene terephthalate)&#160;(PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein&#8217;s molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group. Conversely, activating the molecular switch triggers a ring&#8208;closing reaction that detaches acid anhydrides, bringing about equal molar ratio of groups and thereby facilitating an increase in molecular weight. By simply incorporating a molecular switch into condensation products based on melt polycondensation, closed&#8208;loop recycling capability is achieved without necessitating excessive organic solvents or complex depolymerization processes. The present study not only presents a novel pathway for end&#8208;of&#8208;use PET upcycling but also introduces an innovative concept of molecular switching for the closed&#8208;loop recyclability of condensation polymers, thereby demonstrating significant potential for large&#8208;scale implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Potential of a Chimaera: a Peptide&#8208;Peptide Nucleic Acid Molecule Designed To Interact with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous RNA&#8208;binding proteins have modular structures with folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions, making their atomic characterization difficult. This severely limits the investigation of their modalities of interaction as well as the evaluation of possible ways to interfere with this process. We report herein a rational strategy for the design and synthesis of a ligand able to interfere with the protein function, monitoring the interaction through solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our approach employs a chimaera composed of two different fragments, a peptide and a peptide&#8208;nucleic acid, allowing to incorporate in the resulting molecule key features to address RNA&#8208;protein interactions. Focusing on two constructs of the N protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the globular N&#8208;terminal domain and a more extended one comprising also two flanking intrinsically disordered regions, we demonstrate the enhanced affinity of the designed peptide&#8208;peptide nucleic acid chimaera for the protein compared to a related peptide lacking &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking contributions within the chain. Furthermore, we emphasize the increasingly recognized relevant and synergistic role of the intrinsically disordered regions in protein&#8208;ligand interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of Aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl diazosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellentdiastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Glucuronidase&#8208;Instructed Glycopeptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells through Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current cancer treatments face significant challenges, including limited tumor specificity and drug resistance. Enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular peptide assembly targeting lysosomes offers a promising strategy to address these issues; however, self&#8208;assembling units that withstand lysosomal conditions are still scarce. In this study, we present a versatile glycopeptide incorporating glucuronic acid and glucose that undergoes glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form nanofibers, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that in glucuronidase&#8208;overexpressing HepG2 cells, glycopeptide assembly induces cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. The involvement of carbohydrate&#8208;binding receptor in enhancing the cellular entry of glycopeptides and improving proteolytic stability highlights the importance of glycan modification. Notably, combining this glycopeptide with cisplatin or adriamycin results in synergistic cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer lines. These findings establish a novel, LMP&#8208;inducing glycopeptide scaffold for developing targeted approaches for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Azo Dye Removal through Sequential Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted&#8208;Treatment&#160;and Photocatalysis Using CdZnS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The treatment of high&#8208;concentration azo dyes remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional single&#8208;mode approaches. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that sequentially combines ultrasound&#8208;assisted&#8208;adsorption with photocatalysis using CdZnS solid solutions to efficiently and rapidly remove high&#8208;concentration azo dyes. CdZnS exhibits high adsorption capacity and exceptional photocatalytic activity, enabling initial dye capture and enrichment, followed by significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption of Congo Red (CR) on CdZnS solid solutions follows the Freundlich and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order models, demonstrating a multilayer adsorption behavior involving physical and chemical interactions. Ultrasound assistance during the first stage not only significantly reduces equilibrium time, but also results in enhanced negative charges in CdZnS that extend to the subsequent photocatalysis stage. This charge enhancement substantially improves CR photodegradation performance, establishing synergistic interactions between ultrasonic treatment and photodegradation. The system demonstrates excellent performance in treating both concentrated single dyes and complex dye mixtures, maintaining high efficiency over multiple treatment cycles. This integrated approach provides new insights for developing more effective technologies for dye degradation and practical wastewater treatment applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering Spatially Separated Redox Centers Enable Efficient Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air is promising but still challenging as insufficient reaction active sites and low reaction efficiency. We have ingeniously applied molecular engineering methods to design an anthraquinone molecularly grafted metal&#8208;organic framework piezo&#8208;photocatalyst (denoted as UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ) for H2O2 generation from water and air. The catalyst achieves a peak H2O2 yield of 7872.4 &#956;M g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, primarily owing to the presence of spatially separated redox sites that enable simultaneously two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron water oxidation and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reactions. Notably, experimental and computational simulations confirm rapid carrier separation under the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;chain charge transfer mode. Electrons transfer to the AQ part and rapidly form internal peroxides for spontaneous oxygen reduction reaction while holes direct to the UiO&#8208;66 ligand for the water oxidation reaction. Additionally, a continuous flow tubular reactor with catalytic membranes made of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ affords 96% removal of organic dyes through the self&#8208;Fenton process under visible light and vibrating water flow, confirming the significant potential of the catalyst for practical applications. This work deepens the understanding of directional carrier migration at piezo&#8208;photocatalytic spatial separation sites, opening new pathways for environmentally friendly and efficient H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Using "Porous Water&#8221; for High&#8208;purity Carbon Monoxide Electrosynthesis from Dilute Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of high&#8208;purity carbon monoxide (CO) from captured carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) remains energy&#8208;intensive due to the unavoidable CO&#8322; regeneration and post&#8208;purification stages. Here, we propose a direct high&#8208;purity CO electrosynthesis strategy employing an innovative electrolyte, termed porous electrolyte (PE), based on "porous water". Zeolite nanocrystals within PE provide permanent pores in the liquid phase, enabling physical CO&#8322; adsorption through an intraparticle diffusion model, as demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations and in&#8208;situ spectral analysis. Captured CO&#8322; spontaneously desorbs under applied reductive potential, driven by the interfacial CO&#8322; concentration gradient, and is subsequently reduced electrochemically. The high CO&#8322; concentration in PE enhances mass transfer, and surface ion exchange between Si&#8211;OH groups and K&#8314; ions on the zeolite surface generates a stronger interfacial electric field, promoting electron transfer steps. This optimized kinetics for mass and electron transfer confers heightened intrinsic activity toward CO&#8322; electroreduction. The PE&#8208;based electrolysis system demonstrated superior CO Faradaic efficiency &#160;and partial current density compared to the conventional CO&#8322;&#8208;fed system. A circular system using PE and a Ni&#8208;N/C cathode realized continuous production of high&#8208;purity CO (97.0 wt%) from dilute CO2 (15%) and maintained &gt; 90.0 wt% under 150 mA cm&#8208;2, with significantly reduced energy consumption and costs.</dc:description>
