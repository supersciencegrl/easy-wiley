      <dc:description>While many key photophysical features are understood for electronic communication between chromophores in neutral compounds, there is limited information on the effect of charges in practically relevant ionic chromo/fluorophores. Here we have chosen positively charged rhodamines and prepared a selection of homo&#8208; and heterodimers with alkyl or &#960;&#8208;conjugated, acetylenic bridges. Protonated molecules were transferred as isolated ions to gas phase where there is no solvent screening of charges, and fluorescence spectra were measured with a custom&#8208;made ion&#8208;trap setup. Our work reveals strong polarization of the&#160;&#960;&#8208;spacer (induced dipole/quadrupole) when it experiences the electric field from one / two dyes. Hence, &#960;&#8208;spacers provide efficient shielding of charges by reducing the Coulomb interaction, whereas two dye cations polarize each other when connected by an alkyl. The screening influences the F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer efficiency that relies on the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Experimentally observed reverse intersystem crossing&#8208;boosted lasing</title>
      <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials, featuring an energy upconversion from triplet to singlet states, are anticipated to overcome triplet&#8208;related losses towards electrically driven organic lasers. Thus far, contributions from triplets to lasing have not yet been experimentally convinced, which should be ascribed to the difficulties in constructing devices with both high triplet&#8208;harvesting ability and strong cavity effect. Here, we experimentally achieve reverse intersystem crossing (RISC)&#8208;boosted lasing in organic microspheres with uniformly dispersed TADF emitters. In these materials, triplets are continuously converted to radiative singlets through RISC, giving rise to reduced losses in stimulated emission. The involvement of regenerated singlets in population inversion results in a thermally activated lasing; that is, the lasing intensity increases with increasing temperature, accompanied by accelerated depletion of the excited&#8208;state population. Benefiting from the suppression of triplet accumulations by RISC processes, a high&#8208;repetition&#8208;rate microlaser was achieved. This work represents an important advance in the comprehension of the excited&#8208;state processes in TADF materials for developing high&#8208;performance organic lasers.</dc:description>

      <title>The Conformational Equilibrium of the Neuropeptide Y2 Receptor in Bilayer Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic structural transitions within the seven&#8208;transmem&#173;brane bundle represent the mechanism by which G protein&#8208;coupled receptors convert an extracellular chemical signal into an intracel&#173;lular biological function. Here, the conformational dynamics of the neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 (Y2R) during activation was investi&#173;gated. The apo, full agonist&#8208; and arrestin&#8208;bound states of Y2R were prepared by cell&#8208;free expression, functional refolding, and reconsti&#173;tution into lipid membranes. To study the conformational transitions between these states, all six tryptophans of Y2R were  13  C&#8208;labeled. NMR signal assignment was achieved by dynamic nuclear polari&#173;zation enhancement and the individual functional states of the recep&#173;tor were characterized by monitoring  13  C NMR chemical shifts. Activation of Y2R is mediated by molecular switches involving the toggle switch residue Trp281  6.48  of the highly conserved SWLP motif and Trp327  7.55  adjacent to the NPxxY motif.

      <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanoparticles: An Emerging Versatile Platform for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificially synthesized affinity materials with tailor&#8208;made binding cavities complementary to the template molecules in shape, size and functionality. Recently, engineering MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines to improve cancer therapy has become a rapidly growing field and future research direction. Because of the unique properties and functions of MIPs, MIP&#8208;based nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) are not only alternative to current nanomaterials for cancer therapy, but also hold the potential to fill some gaps associated with biological ligand&#8208;based nanomedicines, such as immunogenicity, stability, applicability and economic rationality. In this mini&#8208;review, we survey recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanoMIPs for cancer therapy, and highlight their distinct features. In addition, using the features of MIPs to rationally design and construct cancer nanomedicines with desired performance, including extended circulation, active targeting, controlled drug release and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy are summarized and discussed.

      <title>High&#8208;Density and Thermally Stable Palladium Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Chemoselective Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have shown superior activity and/or selectivity for many energy&#8208; and environment&#8208;related reactions, but their stability at high site density and under reducing atmosphere remains unresolved. Herein, we elucidate the intrinsic driving force of palladium single atom with high site density (up to 5 wt%) under reducing atmosphere, and its unique catalytic performance for hydrogenation reactions.  In&#8208;situ  experiments (including scanning transmission electron microscopy, near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and quasi in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray adsorption) and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms tend to migrate into the surface vacancy&#8208;enriched molybdenum carbide surface during the carburization process by transferring oxide crystals to carbide crystals, leading to the surface enrichment of atomic Pd instead of formation of particles. The Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst exhibits high activity and excellent selectivity for both liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics (&gt; 99%) and gas&#8208;phase hydrogenation of CO  2  to CO (&gt; 98%), which is far superior to their nanoparticles analogues. More importantly, the Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst could endure harsh reducing/reacting atmosphere up to 400  o  C without any observable aggregation of single atoms. This work provides an alternative pathway to pursue single&#8208;atom catalysts with preferable performance and stability at high level of site density even under harsh reducing conditions.</dc:description>

More importantly, the Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst could endure harsh reducing/reacting atmosphere up to 400  o  C without any observable aggregation of single atoms. This work provides an alternative pathway to pursue single&#8208;atom catalysts with preferable performance and stability at high level of site density even under harsh reducing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Drug&#8208;like properties in macrocycles above MW 1000: Backbone rigidity vs. side&#8208;chain lipophilicity</title>
      <dc:description>Large, macrocyclic peptides can achieve surprisingly high membrane permeability, although the properties that govern permeability in this chemical space are only beginning to come into focus. We generated two libraries of cyclic decapeptides with stable, cross&#8208; b conformations, and found that peptoid substitutions within the b &#8208;turns of the macrocycle preserved the rigidity of the parent scaffold, whereas peptoid substitutions in the opposing b &#8208;strands led to &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; species that were rigid in nonpolar media but highly flexible in water. Both rigid and chameleonic compounds showed high permeability over a wide lipophilicity range, with peak permeabilities differing significantly depending on scaffold rigidity. Our findings indicate that modulating lipophilicity can be used to engineer favorable ADME properties into both rigid and flexible macrocyclic peptides, and that scaffold rigidity can be used to tune optimal lipophilicity.</dc:description>

Herein, we present the successful doping of copper(I) into 0D Cs  2  ZnBr  4  .

To further study the role of A&#8208;site cation and halogen, A  2  ZnCl  4  :Cu (A= Cs, Rb) are also synthesized and found to generate intense sky&#8208;blue emission (PLQY ~73.1%).

      <title>N&#8208;doped Carbon Assisted One&#8208;pot Tandem Reaction for Vinyl Chloride Production via Ethylene Oxychlorination</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrated   a bifunctional catalyst design concept of CuCl  2  /Al  2  O  3  and N&#8208;doped carbon for an efficient one&#8208;pot ethylene oxychlorination process to produce VCM up to 76% yield at 250 &#730;C and ambient pressure, higher than the conventional industrial two&#8208;step process (~50%). In addition to the CuCl  2  &#8208;based ethylene oxychlorination catalyst in the first bed, we demonstrated the active sites containing N&#8208;functional groups on the metal&#8208;free N&#8208;doped carbon in the second bed catalyzed both ethylene oxychlorination and ethylene dichloride (EDC) dehydrochlorination at the mild conditions. Benefit from the bi&#8208;function of the N&#8208;doped carbon, the VCM formation was intensified by the surface Cl*&#8208;looping of EDC dehydrochlorination and ethylene oxychlorination. Both reactions were enhanced by in&#8208;situ consumption of surface Cl* by oxychlorination, in which Cl* was generated by EDC dehydrochlorination. This work paves a promising alternative way for VCM production via ethylene oxychlorination at mild conditions through a single pass reactor   .</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we demonstrated   a bifunctional catalyst design concept of CuCl  2  /Al  2  O  3  and N&#8208;doped carbon for an efficient one&#8208;pot ethylene oxychlorination process to produce VCM up to 76% yield at 250 &#730;C and ambient pressure, higher than the conventional industrial two&#8208;step process (~50%). In addition to the CuCl  2  &#8208;based ethylene oxychlorination catalyst in the first bed, we demonstrated the active sites containing N&#8208;functional groups on the metal&#8208;free N&#8208;doped carbon in the second bed catalyzed both ethylene oxychlorination and ethylene dichloride (EDC) dehydrochlorination at the mild conditions. Benefit from the bi&#8208;function of the N&#8208;doped carbon, the VCM formation was intensified by the surface Cl*&#8208;looping of EDC dehydrochlorination and ethylene oxychlorination. Both reactions were enhanced by in&#8208;situ consumption of surface Cl* by oxychlorination, in which Cl* was generated by EDC dehydrochlorination. This work paves a promising alternative way for VCM production via ethylene oxychlorination at mild conditions through a single pass reactor   .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Hydrocyanation of Nonconjugated Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>The&#160;metal&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reaction has recently emerged as a powerful strategy to functionalize remote positions in organic molecules. However, a chain&#8208;walking protocol for nonconjugated dienes remains scarcely reported and his development is currently ongoing. In this context, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of nonconjugated dienes involving the chain&#8208;walking process is demonstrated. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and a wide range of substrates were tolerated, delivering the products in high yields and enantioselectivities. Deuterium labeling experiments support the chain&#8208;walking process which involves an iterative &#946;&#8208;H elimination and reinsertion processes. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, regioconvergent experiments, and downstream transformations gave further insights into the high potential of this transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>LaOCl&#8208;coupled polymeric carbon nitride for overall water splitting through a  one&#8208;photon excitation pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Sun&#8208;light driven water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases in a large scale is a promising method for solar energy conversion. However, it is still a challenge to explore photocatalytic materials for overall water splitting due to the limited choice of a single semiconductor with suitable band energy levels (matching with water redox splitting potentials) while with minimized band gap for light harvesting. Here, we report a one&#8208;photon excitation pathway by coupling polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with LaOCl semiconductor to achieve overall water splitting. This artificial photosynthesis composite catalyzes the decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2, with evolution rates of 22.3 and 10.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1, respectively, outperforming most of the PCN&#8208;based materials. The high photocatalytic performance of PCN/LaOCl can be ascribed to the simultaneously accomplished reduction and oxidation of water on LaOCl and PCN domains, respectively, as well as the fast charge separation and migration induced by the interfacial electric field related to LaOCl modification. This study provides new insights on the development &#160;of composite photocatalysts for pure water splitting on the basis of polymer&#8208;based materials via charge modulation.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Spectral and Photochemical Properties of Bio&#8208;inspired Retinal Mimics via in Silico Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the spectral tunability and isomerization activity is currently one of the hot topics in the design of photo&#8208;reversible molecular switches for application in optoelectronic devices. The present work demonstrates how to manipulate the absorption of the retinal protonated Schiff base (rPSB) chromophore over the entire visible range by targeted functionalization of the retinal backbone. Moreover, we establish a correlation between the vertical excitation energy and the profile of the potential energy surface of the bright excited state responsible for the photoreactivity of rPSB. We exploited this correlation to rank the functionalized rPSB into different classes with characteristic photoisomerization activity. Eventually, the synergic effects of functionalization and of external electric fields in the few MV/cm range have been applied to achieve a reversable and regioselective control of the photoisomerization propensity of selected rPBS derivatives.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlling the spectral tunability and isomerization activity is currently one of the hot topics in the design of photo&#8208;reversible molecular switches for application in optoelectronic devices. The present work demonstrates how to manipulate the absorption of the retinal protonated Schiff base (rPSB) chromophore over the entire visible range by targeted functionalization of the retinal backbone. Moreover, we establish a correlation between the vertical excitation energy and the profile of the potential energy surface of the bright excited state responsible for the photoreactivity of rPSB. We exploited this correlation to rank the functionalized rPSB into different classes with characteristic photoisomerization activity. Eventually, the synergic effects of functionalization and of external electric fields in the few MV/cm range have been applied to achieve a reversable and regioselective control of the photoisomerization propensity of selected rPBS derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Posttranslational arginases provide a ribosomal route to non&#8208;proteinogenic ornithine residues in diverse peptide sequences</title>
      <dc:description>Ornithine is a component of many bioactive nonribosomal peptides but has been challenging to incorporate into ribosomal products. We recently identified OspR, a cyanobacterial arginase&#8208;like enzyme that installs ornithines in the antiviral ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) landornamide A. Here we report that OspR belongs to a larger family of peptide arginases from diverse organisms and RiPP types. In  E.&#160;coli  expressions, seven selected enzymes converted arginine residues to ornithines with little preference for the leader type. A diverse range of peptide sequences was modified, including polyarginine repeats. Further exploring the synthetic potential of OspR, we generated analogues of ornithine&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides using RiPP technology. Five pseudo&#8208;nonribosomal products with ornithines at correct positions were obtained. This included a brevicidine analogue containing ornithine and a d&#8208;amino acid that was installed by the peptide epimerase OspD, suggesting new opportunities for peptide bioengineering.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Propagation of homochirality plays a crucial role in the discussion on the origin of life. We here investigate the role of structurally related enantiopure additives in chiral symmetry breaking during reactive crystallizations. We demonstrate that a symmetry breaking process can be driven towards the same absolute configuration as the additive if this additive forms an enantiospecific solid solution with the racemate. We observe two antagonistic processes: enantiospecific growth inhibition directs symmetry breaking to the opposite enantiomer following &#8220;the rule of reversal&#8221; and enantiospecific solid solution formation that favors homochiral outcomes. During continuous grinding, contributions of solid solution formation override contributions of enantiospecific growth inhibition, directing the process towards the absolute configuration of the additive.

      <title>Magnetic Levitation in Chemistry, Materials Science, and Biochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
A density&#8208;based technique&#8212;magnetic levitation (MagLev)&#8212;developed and used to solve problems in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry is described in this Review. MagLev has two principal characteristics: i)&#8197;it is density&#8208;based, and thus in principle applicable to all materials, and ii)&#8197;it is simple&#8212;a characteristic that makes it useful for a number of applications.







Abstract
All matter has density. The recorded uses of density to characterize matter date back to as early as ca. 250 BC, when Archimedes was believed to have solved &#8220;The Puzzle of The King's Crown&#8221; using density.[1] Today, measurements of density are used to separate and characterize a range of materials (including cells and organisms), and their chemical and/or physical changes in time and space. This Review describes a density&#8208;based technique&#8212;magnetic levitation (which we call &#8220;MagLev&#8221; for simplicity)&#8212;developed and used to solve problems in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry. MagLev has two principal characteristics&#8212;simplicity, and applicability to a wide range of materials&#8212;that make it useful for a number of applications (for example, characterization of materials, quality control of manufactured plastic parts, self&#8208;assembly of objects in 3D, separation of different types of biological cells, and bioanalyses). Its simplicity and breadth of applications also enable its use in low&#8208;resource settings (for example&#8212;in economically developing regions&#8212;in evaluating water/food quality, and in diagnosing disease).

      <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Hyperpolarization of Gases</title>
      <dc:description>
PHIP and SABRE: This Minireview gives a selective overview of two hyperpolarization techniques: ParaHydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) and Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) in the context of production of hyperpolarized gases for potential applications in bioimaging and beyond.







Abstract
Imaging of gases is a major challenge for any modality including MRI. NMR and MRI signals are directly proportional to the nuclear spin density and the degree of alignment of nuclear spins with applied static magnetic field, which is called nuclear spin polarization. The level of nuclear spin polarization is typically very low, i.e., one hundred thousandth of the potential maximum at 1.5&#8201;T and a physiologically relevant temperature. As a result, MRI typically focusses on imaging highly concentrated tissue water. Hyperpolarization methods transiently increase nuclear spin polarizations up to unity, yielding corresponding gains in MRI signal level of several orders of magnitude that enable the 3D imaging of dilute biomolecules including gases. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a fast, highly scalable, and low&#8208;cost hyperpolarization technique. The focus of this Minireview is to highlight selected advances in the field of parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization for the production of hyperpolarized compounds, which can be potentially employed as inhalable contrast agents.

      <title>Discovery and biosynthesis of bolagladins: unusual lipodepsipeptides from Burkholderia gladioli clinical isolates</title>
      <dc:description>Two  Burkholderia gladioli  strains isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients were found to produce unusual lipodepsipeptides containing a unique citrate&#8208;derived fatty acid and a rare dehydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alanine residue.

In&#8208;frame deletions and enzyme activity assays were used to investigate the functions of several proteins encoded by the biosynthetic gene cluster, which was found in the genomes of about 50% of  B. gladioli  isolates, suggesting that its metabolic products play an important role in the growth and/or survival of the species. The Chrome Azurol S (CAS) assay indicated that these metabolites bind ferric iron, which suppresses their production when added to the growth medium. Moreover, a gene encoding a TonB&#8208;dependent ferric&#8208;siderophore receptor is adjacent to the biosynthetic genes, suggesting that these metabolites may function as siderophores in  B. gladioli  .</dc:description>

      <title>Hydroxamic Acids Immobilized on Resins (HAIRs): A Toolbox for the Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Targeting HDAC Inhibitors and HDAC Degraders (PROTACs)</title>
      <dc:description>Inhibition of more than one cancer&#8208;related pathway by multi&#8208;target agents is an emerging approach in modern anticancer drug discovery. Here, based on the well&#8208;established synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents, we present the discovery of a series of alkylating HDACi using a pharmacophore&#8208;linking strategy. For the parallel synthesis of the target compounds, we developed an efficient solid&#8208;phase supported protocol using hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) as stable and versatile building blocks for the preparation of functionalized HDACi. The most promising compound, 3n, was significantly more active in apoptosis induction, activation of caspase 3/7, and formation of DNA damage (&#947;&#8208;H2AX) than the sum of the activities of either active principle alone. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our preloaded resins, the HAIR approach was successfully extended to the synthesis of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which efficiently degrades histone deacetylases.</dc:description>

      <title>Intervening Tumor Progression by Coupling Bacteria Respiration with Tumor Metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>By virtue of the unique feature of  Shewanella oneidensis  MR&#8208;1 (  S. oneidensis  MR&#8208;1) that anaerobically catabolize lactate through transferring electrons to metal minerals for respiration, a lactate&#8208;fueled biohybrid (Bac@MnO  2  ) here is constructed by modifying manganese dioxide (MnO  2  ) nanoflowers on the  S. oneidensis  MR&#8208;1 surface.

      <title>An X&#8208;ray Photoconductive Detector with High Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Merit based on an Open&#8208;Framework Chalcogenide Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>A wide range of tunability in physical parameters of a semiconductor used for X&#8208;ray detection is desirable to achieve targeted performance optimization. However, in a dense&#8208;phase semiconductor, fine&#8208;tuning one parameter often leads to unwanted changes in other parameters. Herein, the intrinsic openness in an open&#8208;framework semiconductor has been proven for the first time to be a key structural factor that weakens the mutual exclusivity of the adjustable physical parameters owing to a non&#8208;linear control mechanism. The controllable doping of S into a zeolitic In&#8208;Se host results in an optimal balance&#160;between resistivity, band gap, and carrier mobility, which finally results in an excellent X&#8208;ray detector with a high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of the mobility&#8208;lifetime product (7.12&#215;10  &#8722;4  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  ); this value is superior to that of a commercial  &#945;  &#8208;Se detector. The current strategy of choosing open&#8208;framework semiconductor materials opens a new window for targeting high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A wide range of tunability in physical parameters of a semiconductor used for X&#8208;ray detection is desirable to achieve targeted performance optimization. However, in a dense&#8208;phase semiconductor, fine&#8208;tuning one parameter often leads to unwanted changes in other parameters. Herein, the intrinsic openness in an open&#8208;framework semiconductor has been proven for the first time to be a key structural factor that weakens the mutual exclusivity of the adjustable physical parameters owing to a non&#8208;linear control mechanism. The controllable doping of S into a zeolitic In&#8208;Se host results in an optimal balance&#160;between resistivity, band gap, and carrier mobility, which finally results in an excellent X&#8208;ray detector with a high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of the mobility&#8208;lifetime product (7.12&#215;10  &#8722;4  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  ); this value is superior to that of a commercial  &#945;  &#8208;Se detector. The current strategy of choosing open&#8208;framework semiconductor materials opens a new window for targeting high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sharp Switching of DNAzyme Activity through the Formation of a Cu(II)&#8208;mediated Carboxyimidazole Base Pair</title>
      <dc:description>DNAzymes are widely used as functional units for creating DNA&#8208;based sensors and devices. Switching of DNAzyme activity by external stimuli is of increasing interest. Herein we report a Cu  II  &#8208;responsive DNAzyme rationally designed by incorporating one of the most stabilizing artificial metallo&#8208;base pairs, a Cu  II  &#8208;mediated carboxyimidazole base pair (  Im  C  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;  Im  C  ), into a known RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme. Cleavage of the substrate was suppressed without Cu  II  , but the reaction proceeded efficiently in the presence of Cu  II  ions. This is due to the induction of a catalytically active structure by  Im  C  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;  Im  C  pairing. The on&#8211;off ratio was as high as 12&#8208;fold, which far exceeds that of the previous DNAzyme having a Cu  II  &#8208;mediated hydroxypyridone base pair. The DNAzyme activity was regulated in response specifically to Cu  II  ions during the reaction via addition, removal, and reduction of Cu  II  . This approach would advance the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA systems with a sharp switching function.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with H2O (D2O) as the H (D) Source over a Pd&#8208;P Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Developing a facile controllable avenue to selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with a defined configuration using a cheap and safe hydrogen donor is highly desirable, but remains a big challenge. Here, we reported a selective semihydrogenation (deuteration) of numerous terminal and internal alkynes using H  2  O (D  2  O) as the H (D) source over a Pd&#8208;P alloy cathode at a lower potential. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the doping of P caused the enhanced specific adsorption of alkynes and the promoted intrinsic activity for producing adsorbed atomic hydrogen (H*  ads  ) from water electrolysis. The semihydrogenation of alkynes could be accomplished at a lower potential with up to 99% selectivity and 78% Faraday efficiency of alkene products, outperforming pure Pd and commercial Pd/C. This electrochemical semihydrogenation of alkynes might proceed via a H*  ads  addition pathway rather than a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. The decreased amount of H  ads  at lower potential and the more preferential adsorption of the Pd&#8208;P to C&#8801;C &#960; bond than C=C moiety resulted in the excellent alkene selectivity. The thermodynamically unstable but synthetically significant  Z  &#8208;alkenes with &gt; 99%  Z  selectivity were expediently accessed. This method is capable of producing the synthetically more useful but highly challenged mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;deuterated alkenes with up to 99% deuterium incorporation. The paired production of crucial industrial feedstock adiponitrile at anode and alkene at the cathode in a Pd&#8208;P || NiSe two&#8208;electrode system demonstrated its promising potential.</dc:description>

      <title>A simple biosystem for the high&#8208;yielding cascade conversion of racemic alcohols to enantiopure amines</title>
      <dc:description>The amination of racemic alcohols to produce enantiopure amines is an important green chemistry reaction for pharmaceutical manufacturing, requiring simple and efficient solutions. Here we developed a novel concept and the simplest system for ADH&#8208;TA&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction to aminate racemic alcohols, which utilizes an ambidextrous ADH to oxidize a racemic alcohol, an enantioselective transaminase to convert the ketone intermediate to chiral amine, and isopropylamine to recycle PMP and NAD  +  cofactors via the reversed cascade reactions. The concept was proven by using an ambidextrous CpSADH&#8208;W286A engineered from (  S  )&#8208;enantioselective CpSADH as the first example of evolving ambidextrous ADHs, an enantioselective BmTA, and isopropylamine.

      <title>How far does energy migrate in DNA and cause damage? Evidence for long&#8208;range photodamage to DNA</title>
      <dc:description>A new DNA architecture addresses the question, how far energy migrates in DNA and forms cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as photodamages causing skin cancer. The 3&#8208;methoxyxanthone nucleoside allows site&#8208;selective photoenergy injection into DNA. The designated CPD site lacks the phosphodiester bond and can be placed in defined distances. The CPD formation links two oligonucleotides together and allows probing by gel electrophoresis. We obtained a sigmoidal distance dependence with R  0  of 25&#177;3 &#197;. Below R  0  , short&#8208;range energy migration occurs with high CPD yields and shallow distance dependence, characteristic for a coherent process. 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;C as epigenetic modification on the 3&#8217;&#8208;side facilitates CPD formation. Above R  0  , long&#8208;range incoherent energy migration occurs over 30 A&#8208;T pairs (105.4 &#197;). The evidence of long&#8208;range CPD formation is fundamental for our understanding of DNA photodamaging.</dc:description>

      <title>Bis(perchlorocatecholato)germane: Hard and Soft Lewis Superacid with Unlimited Water Stability</title>
      <dc:description>Previously described Lewis superacids are moisture sensitive and predominantly hard in character &#8211; features that are severely limiting their widespread use in orbital controlled reactions and under non&#8208;inert conditions. Herein, we describe adducts of bis(perchlorocatecholato)germane, the first hard and soft Lewis superacid based on germanium. Remarkably, the synthesis of this compound is performed in water, and the obtained H  2  O&#8208;adduct constitutes a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. If applied as adduct with aprotic donors, it displays excellent activity in a diverse set of Lewis acid catalyzed transformations, covering hydrosilylation, hydrodefluorination, transfer hydrogenation, and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. Given the very straightforward synthetic access from two commercially available precursors, the unlimited water stability and the soft Lewis acidic character, it promotes the transfer of Lewis superacidity into organic synthesis and materials science.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previously described Lewis superacids are moisture sensitive and predominantly hard in character &#8211; features that are severely limiting their widespread use in orbital controlled reactions and under non&#8208;inert conditions. Herein, we describe adducts of bis(perchlorocatecholato)germane, the first hard and soft Lewis superacid based on germanium. Remarkably, the synthesis of this compound is performed in water, and the obtained H  2  O&#8208;adduct constitutes a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. If applied as adduct with aprotic donors, it displays excellent activity in a diverse set of Lewis acid catalyzed transformations, covering hydrosilylation, hydrodefluorination, transfer hydrogenation, and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. Given the very straightforward synthetic access from two commercially available precursors, the unlimited water stability and the soft Lewis acidic character, it promotes the transfer of Lewis superacidity into organic synthesis and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Nature of Strong Chalcogen Bonds Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Chalcogen bonds are &#963; hole interactions and have been used in recent years as an alternative to hydrogen bonds. In general, the electrostatic potential at the chalcogen atom and orbital delocalization effects are made responsible for the orientation of the chalcogen bond. Here, we were able to show by means of SAPT calculations that neither the induction (orbital delocalization effects) nor the electrostatic term is causing the spatial orientation of strong chalcogen bonds in tellurium&#8208;containing aromatics. Instead, steric interactions (Pauli repulsion) are responsible for the orientation. Against chemical intuition the dispersion energies of the examined tellurium&#8208;containing aromatics are far less important for the net attractive forces compared to the energies in the corresponding sulfur and selenium compounds. Our results underline the importance of often overlooked steric interactions (Pauli repulsion) in conformational control of &#963; hole interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective crystallization of chiral inorganic crystals of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)2 with amino acids</title>
      <dc:description>Many inorganic materials can form crystals but little is known about their enantioselective crystallization. In this article, we report on the enantioselective crystallization of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  (Wulfingite) chiral crystals using amino acids. Crystals of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  were crystallized from supersaturated sodium&#8208;hydroxide and zinc&#8208;nitrate aqueous solutions in the presence of L&#8208; or D&#8208;Arginine. All our chiral measurements, such as selective chiral adsorption by circular dichroisem (CD) /chiral chromatography and polarimetry measurements, clearly show chiral discrimination during the crystallization of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  . In addition, we have developed a new method for identifying chirality in crystals using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Although the values of chiral induction of the &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  crystals we obtained are somewhat low, they are still significant since they demonstrate that enantioselectivity during crystallization of chiral inorganic crystals with chiral additives can be achieved. The method is quite general and can be applied to many chiral inorganic systems. Understanding and controlling the crystallization of chiral inorganic crystals is of importance for gaining knowledge on the interaction of chiral molecules with inorganic surfaces. This can lead to understanding basic scientific questions such as the evolution of homochirality in biomolecules and developing chiral inorganic crystals for a variety of purposes such as asymmetric catalysis, optical applications and more.</dc:description>

      <title>Disulfide&#8208;linked allosteric modulators for multi&#8208;cycle kinetic control of DNA&#8208;based nanodevices</title>
      <dc:description>Nature employs sulfur switches, i.e. redox&#8208;active disulfides, to kinetically control biological pathways in a highly efficient and reversible way. Inspired by this mechanism we describe here a DNA&#8208;based synthetic nanodevice that acts as a sulfur switch and can be temporally controlled though redox regulation. To do this we rationally designed disulfide DNA strands (modulators) that hybridize to a ligand&#8208;binding DNA nanodevice and act as redox&#8208;active allosteric regulators inducing the nanodevice to release or load its ligand. Upon reduction, the allosteric modulator spontaneously de&#8208;hybridizes from the nanodevice and, as a result, its effect is transient. The system is reversible and has an unprecedented high tolerance to waste products and displays transient behavior for over 40 cycles without significant loss of efficiency. Kinetic control of DNA&#8208;based ligand&#8208;binding nanodevices through purely chemical reactions paves the way for temporal regulation of more complex chemical pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Zeolite&#8208;Encaged Pd&#8208;Mn Nanocatalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation and Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage energy cycle is a promising way to implement the hydrogen economy, but the exploration of efficient catalysts to achieve this process remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer Pd&#8208;Mn clusters were encaged within silicalite&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolites by a ligand&#8208;protected method under direct hydrothermal conditions. The obtained zeolite&#8208;encaged metallic nanocatalysts exhibited extraordinary catalytic activity and durability in both CO2 hydrogenation into formate and formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation back to CO2 and hydrogen. Thanks to the formation of ultrasmall metal clusters and the synergic effect of bi&#8208;metallic components, the PdMn0.6@S&#8208;1 catalyst afforded a formate generation rate of 2151 molformate molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 353 K, and an initial turnover frequency of 6860 molH2 molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for CO&#8208;free FA decomposition at 333 K without any additive. Both values represent the top levels among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. This work demonstrates that zeolite&#8208;encaged metallic catalysts hold great promise to realize CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen energy cycles in the future featuring fast charging and releasing kinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Zephycarinatines via Photocatalytic Reductive Radical ipso&#8208;Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a nonbiomimetic strategy for the total synthesis of the plicamine&#8208;type alkaloids, zephycarinatines C and D. The key feature of the synthesis was the stereoselective reductive radical  ipso&#8208;cyclization using visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. This cyclization enabled the construction of a 6,6&#8208;spirocyclic core structure by the addition of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the aromatic ring. The biological evaluation of zephycarinatines and their derivatives revealed that the synthetic derivative having a keto group displayed moderate inhibitory activity against LPS&#8208;induced NO production. This approach would offer future opportunities to expand the chemical diversity derived from plicamine&#8208;type alkaloids as well as provide useful intermediates for their syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal Catalyzed Insertion Reactions with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>Donor/donor carbenes &#160; are relatively new in the field of carbene chemistry; applications in C&#8211;H and X&#8211;H insertion reactions are few in number, but demonstrate exquisite chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Recent reports have shown that C&#8211;H, &#160; N&#8211;H, B&#8211;H, O&#8211;H, Si&#8211;H, Ge&#8211;H, Sn&#8211;H and P&#8211;H &#160;insertion reactions are feasible with a variety of transition metal catalysts, both inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecularly. Furthermore, high degrees of diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity have been observed in several cases. Methods typically involve the formation of a diazo&#8208;based carbene precursor, but procedures using diazo&#8208;free metal carbenes have been developed with significant success.

      <dc:description>Efficient conversion of solar energy by means of photocatalysis shows huge potential to relieve energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, the unsatisfied conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. Introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on the recent advances in the diversified external fields, involving the microwave, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field and coupled fields, boosted photocatalytic reactions, including contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO  2  reduction and bacterial inactivation.

      <title>Hydrogen bonding enhances the electrochemical hydrogenation of benzaldehyde in the aqueous phase</title>
      <dc:description>The hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol on carbon&#8208;supported metals in water, enabled by an external potential, is markedly promoted by polarization of the functional groups. The presence of polar co&#8208;adsorbates such as substituted phenols enhances the hydrogenation rate of the aldehyde via two effects&#8211;polarizing the carbonyl group and increasing the probability of forming a transition state for H addition. These two effects enable a hydrogenation route, in which phenol acts as a conduit for proton addition, with a higher rate than the direct proton transfer from hydronium ions. The fast hydrogenation enabled by the presence of phenol and applied potential overcompensates for the decrease in coverage of benzaldehyde caused by competitive adsorption. A higher acid strength of the co&#8208;adsorbate increases the intensity of interactions and the rates of selective carbonyl reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Desymmetrized Vertex Design toward a Molecular Cage with Unusual Topology</title>
      <dc:description>A novel low&#8208;symmetry organic molecular cage with distinctive geometry was successfully synthesized from 5,5'&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalaldehyde) and 1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine building blocks, through the desymmetrized vertex design strategy. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that the cage contains asymmetrical and nonplanar windows, exhibiting an unprecedented C2 symmetry and an efficient packing. The molecular cage structure was also characterized by FT&#8208;IR, NMR, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and POM. Quantum chemistry studies show that the cage structure contains rare intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8211;C) bonding interactions. The cage crystals exhibit high iodine vapor uptake (3.78 g&#183;g&#8210;1), which is among the highest for porous molecular materials. The knowledge gained in this study would open new possibilities for the design and synthesis of molecular cages with novel topologies targeting a broad range of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Determinants for Fusion Speed of Biomolecular Droplets</title>
      <dc:description>Biomolecular droplets formed through phase separation have a tendency to fuse. The speed with which fusion occurs is a direct indicator of condensate liquidity, which is key to both cellular functions and diseases. Using a dual&#8208;trap optical tweezers setup, we found the fusion speeds of four types of droplets to differ by two orders of magnitude. The order of fusion speed correlates with the fluorescence of thioflavin T, which in turn reflects the macromolecular packing density inside droplets. Unstructured protein or polymer chains pack loosely and readily rearrange, leading to fast fusion. In contrast, structured protein domains pack more closely and have to break extensive contacts before rearrangement, corresponding to slower fusion.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence beyond 800 nm with High Efficiency and Radiance from Anthracene Cored Emitters</title>

Both molecules have large dipole moments due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer interactions between the amine donors and the DCPA acceptor. Thus, compared with doped films, the emission of neat films of  DCPA&#8208;TPA  and  DCPA&#8208;BBPA  can fully fall into the NIR region (&gt;700 nm) with increasing surrounding polarity by increasing doping ratio. Moreover, the non&#8208;doped devices based on  DCPA&#8208;TPA  and  DCPA&#8208;BBPA  provide NIR emission with peaks at 838 and 916 nm, respectively. A maximum radiannce of 20707 mW Sr  &#8208;1  m  &#8208;2  was realized for the further optimized device based on  DCPA&#8208;TPA  .
