         <title>Identification of inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins through the synthesis of a diverse, sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesterol transport proteins regulate a vast array of cellular processes including lipid metabolism, vesicular and nonvesicular trafficking, organelle contact sites, and autophagy. Despite their undoubted importance, the identification of selective modulators of this class of proteins has been challenging due to the structural similarities in the cholesterol&#8208;binding site. Herein we report a general strategy for the identification of selective inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins  via  the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection. Fusion of a primary sterol fragment to an array of secondary privileged scaffolds led to the identification of potent and selective inhibitors of the cholesterol transport protein Aster&#8208;C, which displayed a surprising preference for the unnatural sterol AB&#8208;ring stereochemistry, and new inhibitors of Aster&#8208;A. We propose that this strategy can, and should be applied to any therapeutically relevant sterol&#8208;binding protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering lattice oxygen activation of iridium clusters stabilized on amorphous bimetal borides array for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ  18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Short&#8208;Wavelength Phase&#8208;Matching Second Harmonic Generation in Boron&#8208;Rich Borosulfate with Planar [BO3] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals which can produce short&#8208;wavelength lasers via a direct second harmonic generation (SHG) process are of great importance in modern laser technology. Currently, the exploration of UV NLO crystals in borosulfates is nearly stagnant since the non&#8208;phase matching (PM) property lies on the small birefringence induced by the intrinsically small optical anisotropy of the tetrahedral groups. Herein, for the first time, the planar [BO3] units were introduced into borosulfates leading to a boron&#8208;rich borosulfate (NH4)2B4SO10 with unprecedented [B4SO10]&#8734; layers and evidently enhanced birefringence. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the shortest SHG PM wavelength of 252 nm in all reported borosulfates with deep UV cutoff edge (184 nm), large SHG response (1.1 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 0.15 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO at 532 nm) and large birefringence (0.056 at 1064 nm) and is easy to grow single crystals via simple chemical vapor deposition method. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing planar [BO3] units to optimize&#160;birefringence of borosulfates, and also open up broad prospects for UV NLO crystals in boron&#8208;rich borosulfates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Molecular Basis of the Catalytic Mechanism of Geranyl Pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 Methyltransferase: Creation of an Unprecedented Farnesyl Pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenyl pyrophosphate methyltransferases enhance the structural diversity of terpenoids. However, the molecular basis of their catalytic mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, using multiple strategies, we characterized a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C&#8208;6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA. Biochemical analysis revealed that BezA requires Mg  2+  and solely methylates GPP. The crystal structures of BezA and its complex with  S  &#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved at 2.10 &#197; and 3.00 &#197;, respectively. Further analyses using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Importantly, the function of E170 as a catalytic base to complete the methylation reaction was established. We also succeeded in switching the substrate specificity by introducing a W210A substitution, resulting in an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 methyltransferase.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast yet accurate prediction for the activity of a nanostructured catalyst is an essential but challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. Despite some successful attempts on describing energetic parameters in different adsorption environments, a general solution to building direct structure&#8208;reactivity relationship quantitatively has not yet been established. On the basis of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we developed a kinetic model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity for reaction systems which are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes. We applied this kinetic model to investigate the size&#8208; and shape&#8208;effects of Cu nano&#8208;catalysts in the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for nano&#8208;catalyst with size over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic nano&#8208;catalyst with size of 877 nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might have been expected. The present model is expected to enhance the kinetic investigations of various chemical systems of interest, especially in chemical systems that are important in hydrogen economics.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot green process to synthesize MXene with controllable surface terminations using molten salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface terminations&#160;of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti  3  C  2  T  x  ) considerably impact its physicochemical properties.&#160;Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8211;F surface&#160;terminations or metallic impurities in MXene.&#160;We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to&#160;synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  . Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus,&#160;&#160;no metallics are present in the Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  product.

Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus,&#160;&#160;no metallics are present in the Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  product. The&#160;surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8211;Cl to &#8211;O and/or &#8211;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the the variety of surface terminations.&#160;The obtained &#8211;O-terminated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225 F g  -1  at 1.0 A g  -1  , good rate performance (91.1% at 10 A g  -1  ) and excellent capacitance retention (100 % after 10000 charging-discharging cycles at 10 A g  -1  ), which is superior to multi-layered Ti  3  C  2  T  x  prepared by other etching methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>La3Ga3Ge2S3O10: An&#160;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxysulfide Designed by Anion&#8208;Directed Band Gap Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide&#8208;containing compounds have been widely studied as infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, they have never been applied in the ultraviolet (UV) region owing to the high energy levels of chalcogen anions, leading to band gap narrowing. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a new UV NLO oxysulfide La  3  Ga  3  Ge  2  S  3  O  10  with an exceptionally wide band gap of 4.70 eV due to from the unique anion&#8208;ordered frameworks comprising 1D  1  &#165;  [(Ga  3/5  Ge  2/5  )  3  S  3  O  3  ] triangular tubes and 0D (Ga  3/5  Ge  2/5  )  2  O  7  dimers of corner&#8208;sharing (Ga/Ge)S  2  O  2  and (Ga/Ge)O  4  tetrahedra, respectively. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements revealed that La  3  Ga  3  Ge  2  S  3  O  10  was phase matchable with twice the SHG response of KH  2  PO  4  . The results of theoretical calculations suggest that the strong SHG response is mainly attributable to the S&#8208;3  p  and O&#8208;2  p  orbitals in the occupied states. The anion&#8208;directed band&#8208;gap engineering may give insights into the application of NLO oxychalcogenides in the UV regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Kinetic Resolution and Asymmetric Induction within a Borrowing Hydrogen Cascade Mediated by a Single Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanistic uniqueness and versatility of borrowing hydrogen catalysis provides an opportunity to investigate the controllability of a cascade reaction, and more importantly, to realize either one or both of chiral recognition and chiral induction simultaneously. Here we report that, in a borrowing hydrogen cascade starting from racemic allylic alcohols, one of the enantiomers could be kinetically resolved, while the other enantiomer could be purposely converted to various targeted products, including &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones and &#947;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. By employing a robust Ru&#8208;catalyst, both kinetic resolution and asymmetric induction were achieved with remarkable levels of efficiency and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that corresponding catalyst&#8208;substrate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are pivotal to realize the observed stereochemical diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA tiling enables precise acylation&#8208;based labeling and control of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for site&#8208;selective labeling of long, native RNAs are needed for studying mRNA biology and future therapies. Current approaches involve engineering RNA sequences, which may alter folding, or are limited to specific sequences or bases. Here, we describe a versatile strategy for mRNA conjugation via a novel DNA tiling approach. The method, TRAIL, exploits a pool of &#8220;protector&#8221; oligodeoxynucleotides to hybridize and block the mRNA, combined with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA that extrudes a reactive RNA loop for acylation at a predetermined site. Using TRAIL, an azido&#8208;acylimidazole reagent was employed for labeling and controlling RNA for multiple applications  in vitro  and in cells, including analysis of RNA&#8208;binding proteins, imaging mRNA in cells, and analysis and control of translation. The TRAIL approach offers an efficient and accessible way to label and manipulate RNAs of virtually any length or origin without altering native sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Simultaneous Imaging of Acidification and Proteolysis in Single Phagosomes Using Bifunctional Janus Particle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The digestion of pathogens inside phagosomes by immune cells occurs through a sequence of reactions including acidification and proteolysis, but how the reactions are orchestrated in the right order is unclear due to a lack of methods to simultaneously measure more than one reaction in phagosomes. Here we report a bifunctional Janus particle probe to simultaneously monitor acidification and proteolysis in single phagosomes in live cells. Each probe consists of a pH reporter and a proteolysis reporter that are spatially separated but function concurrently. Using the Janus probes, we found the acidic pH needed to initiate and maintain proteolysis, revealing the mechanism for the sequential occurrence of both reactions during pathogen digestion. We showed how bacterium&#8208;derived lipopolysaccharide alters the acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. This study showcases the Janus particle probes as a generally applicable tool for monitoring multiple reactions in intracellular vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Cascade Synthetic Strategy Toward Structurally Constrained Boron&#8208;doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs) via a cascade reaction from readily available ortho&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4&#8208;boron migration and successive two&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs bearing B&#8208;doped [4]helicene (  1a  &#8208;  1i  ) or BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene (  1n  &#8208;  1t  ) and double [4]helicene (  1u  &#8208;  1v  ) are constructed by this cascade reaction. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy is characterized by modest yields (20&#8208;50%) and broad substrate scope (18 examples) with versatile functional group tolerance. The resultant sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs show good stability under ambient conditions and are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly enough, BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene  1o  forms a unique alternating &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers of enantiomers within a helical columnar superstructure, while BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene  1u  establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking. The synthetic approach reported herein represents a powerful tool for the rapid generation of novel sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs, which are highly attractive for the elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship and for potential optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Ratiometric Nanothermometry Regulated by Tailoring Annihilators of Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanomicelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a special non&#8208;linear photophysical process that converts low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons based on sensitizer/annihilator pairs. This unique ability of TTA upconversion is especially useful for bio&#8208;applications because the longer&#8208;wavelength light source not only has a larger penetration depth that offers a longer working distance but also is distinguished from the intrinsic auto&#8208;fluorescence that reduces background interference. Moreover, adding stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to TTA upconversion will provide a unique platform for chemosensing and biosensing. Here, we successfully constructed a novel luminescence ratiometric nanothermometer based on TTA upconversion nanomicelles by encapsulating sensitizer/annihilator molecules into a temperature&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic triblock polymer. These TTA upconversion nanomicelles exhibited good linear relationships between the luminescence ratio (integrated intensity ratio of upconverted luminescence peak to the downshifted phosphorescence peak) and the temperature. These TTA upconversion nanomicelles demonstrated excellent thermal sensitivitiy up to 32.56%&#176;C&#8208;1 with outstanding air&#8208;tolerance, and reliability, and reproducibility. Furthermore, we found modifying the annihilators&#8217; chemical structure via introducing hydroxymethyl groups would rule out the interference of the polymer concentration on the thermal sensitivity and stereochemical engineering of annihilators would readily regulate the thermal sensitivity. These upconversion nanomicelles were also successfully applied for thermal imaging of fluids with thermal gradient and in&#8208;situ monitoring of heat dissipation. This work provided a new strategy for designing and modifying TTA upconversion nanomicelles with a higher thermal sensitivity and less interference as ratiometric luminescence nanothermometers for broad potential applications, such as biological thermal imaging, nanomedicine, and micro/nano&#8208;fluidics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacidity of Non&#8208;Planar Boranes: C&#8208;H Bond Activation and Non&#8208;Classical Binding Modes at Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of a geometrically constrained boron Lewis superacid featuring exceptional structure and reactivity is disclosed. It allowed the formation of non&#8208;classical electron deficient B&#8208;H&#8208;B type of bonding which was supported by spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray diffraction parameters as well as computational studies. Taming the pyramidal Lewis acid electrophilicity through weak coordinating anion dissociation enabled a series of highly challenging chemical transformations such as Csp  2  &#8208;H and Csp  3  &#8208;H activation under frustrated Lewis pair regime and the cleavage of Csp  3  &#8208;Si bonds. The demonstration of such type of rich chemical behavior and flexibility on a single molecular compound make it a unique mediator of chemical transformations generally restricted to transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;featured Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Trafficking of Protein Delivery and Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delivery of protein into mammalian cells enables the dissection and manipulation of biological process, while this potency is challenged by lacking efficient protein delivery tool and the way to monitor its intracellular trafficking. Herein, we report that the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;featured metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine can generate fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) to deliver protein into neural cells, a hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cell line using conventional strategy. Further, the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature of TPE enabled the fluorescent monitoring of cytosolic protein release. It is found that FSNPs can deliver and release protein into cytosol for subcellular targeting as fast as 18 h post&#8208;delivery. Moreover, the delivery of molecular chaperone DJ&#8208;1 using FSNPs activates MAPK/ERK signaling of neural cells to protect cells from oxidative stress. Together, our strategy provides a powerful tool for neural cell protein delivery and deciphering cell signaling for developing neurodegenerative disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Selective C&#8211;H and C(sp3)&#8211;+P Bond Functionalizations: An Entry to Bioactive Arylated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphonium salts containing C(sp3)&#8211;+P bonds are among the most utilized reagents in organic synthesis for constructing C&#8211;C double bonds. However, their use as C&#8208;selective electrophilic groups is rare. Here, we explore an efficient and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for sequential chemo&#8208; and regioselective C&#8211;H and C(sp3)&#8211;+P bond functionalizations. In the present study, C&#8211;H alkylation resulting in the synthesis of benzhydryl triarylphosphonium salts was achieved by one&#8208;pot, four&#8208;component, cross&#8208;coupling reactions of simple and commercially available starting materials. The utility of the resulting phosphonium salt building blocks was demonstrated by the chemoselective post&#8208;functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;+PPh3 groups to achieve aminations, thiolations, and arylations. In this way, benzhydrylamines, benzhydrylthioethers, and triarylmethanes, structural motifs which feature in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, are readily accessed. These include the synthesis of two anti&#8208;cancer agents from simple materials in only two to three steps. Additionally, a protocol for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive drugs has been developed using benzhydrylphosphonium salts. This new approach should provide novel transformations for application in both academic and pharmaceutical research.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs) with long&#8208;range ordered and mono&#8208;dispersed ionic groups hold great potential in many advanced applications. Considering the inherent drawbacks of oil&#8208;water biphase method, herein, we explore an oil&#8210;water&#8210;oil triphase method based on phase engineering strategy for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of iCOFNs. The middle water phase serves as a confined reaction region, and the two oil phases are reservoirs for storing and supplying monomers to the water phase. A large aqueous space and low monomer concentration lead to the anisotropic gradual growth of iCOFNs into few&#8208;layer thickness, large lateral size, and high crystallinity. Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra&#8208;high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect&#8208;free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) transmission is a critical challenge in chiroptical research but there are two questions on CPL transmission. How to transfer CPL within intermolecular systems? And can achiral emitters emit CPL? We find the CPL transmission is critically dependent on the resonance transfer, which was attributed to unique circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET).







Abstract
The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. We report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore acts as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of C&#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep it far beyond the resonance distance. This C&#8208;FRET mode provides a de&#8197;novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Chuangxinmycin Featuring a Deubiquitinase&#8208;like Sulfurtransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biochemical basis of the sulfur&#8208;incorporation reaction during chuangxinmycin biosynthesis is elucidated. Particularly, the deubiquitinase&#8208;like Cxm3 stands for the first JAMM/MPN+ family protein catalyzing a sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction, instead of the typical amido&#8208;bond hydrolysis reaction, by interacting with a ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG.







Abstract
The knowledge on sulfur incorporation mechanism involved in sulfur&#8208;containing molecule biosynthesis remains limited. Chuangxinmycin is a sulfur&#8208;containing antibiotic with a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indole (TPI) skeleton and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. Despite the previously reported biosynthetic gene clusters and the recent functional characterization of a P450 enzyme responsible for C&#8722;S bond formation, the enzymatic mechanism for sulfur incorporation remains unknown. Here, we resolve this central biosynthetic problem by in vitro biochemical characterization of the key enzymes and reconstitute the TPI skeleton in a one&#8208;pot enzymatic reaction. We reveal that the JAMM/MPN+ protein Cxm3 functions as a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase to catalyze a non&#8208;classical sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction by interacting with the ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG. This finding adds a new mechanism for sulfurtransferase in nature.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Atom Transfer from Phosphaethynolate to an Alkylidyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of sodium phosphaethynolate, Na(OCP), with vanadium alkylidynes is reported. Metathesis of V&#8801;C and P&#8801;C multiple bonds occurs, followed by carbonyl migration to the metal, overall resulting in a direct P&#8208;atom transfer from Na(OCP) to an alkylidyne ligand to yield vanadium&#8208;bound phosphaalkyne complexes.







Abstract
A low&#8208;spin and mononuclear vanadium complex, (Menacnac)V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu) (2) (Menacnac&#8722;=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), was prepared upon treatment of the vanadium neopentylidyne complex (Menacnac)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf) (1) with Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 (diox=1,4&#8208;dioxane), while the isoelectronic ate&#8208;complex [Na(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)]{([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu)} (4), was obtained via the reaction of Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 and ([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2) (3) in the presence of crown&#8208;ether. Computational studies suggest that the P&#8208;atom transfer proceeds by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of the P&#8801;C bond across the V&#8801;CtBu moiety, followed by a reductive decarbonylation to form the V&#8722;C&#8801;O linkage. The nature of the electronic ground state in diamagnetic complexes, 2 and 4, was further investigated both theoretically and experimentally, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, and comparison of salient bond metrics derived from X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural characterization. In combination, these data are consistent with a low&#8208;valent vanadium ion in complexes 2 and 4. This study represents the first example of a metathesis reaction between the P&#8208;atom of [PCO]&#8722; and an alkylidyne ligand.

         <title>O2&#8208;Assisted Four&#8208;Component Reaction of Vinyl Magnesium Bromide with Chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;Butanesulfinyl Imines To Form syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old reagent with a new use: Vinyl magnesium bromide, a widely used Grignard reagent, can be oxygenated with O2 to give a magnesium enolate intermediate. This enables a four&#8208;component reaction that efficiently converts chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine into a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step.







Abstract
An O2&#8208;assisted, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;I) with O2 (component&#8208;II) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine (component&#8208;III) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;IV). The approach allows diastereoselective synthesis of anti/syn&#8208; and syn/syn&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diols in good yields with high diastereoselectivity.

     alt="O2-Assisted Four-Component Reaction of Vinyl Magnesium Bromide with Chiral N-tert-Butanesulfinyl Imines To Form syn-1,3-Amino Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old reagent with a new use: Vinyl magnesium bromide, a widely used Grignard reagent, can be oxygenated with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give a magnesium enolate intermediate. This enables a four-component reaction that efficiently converts chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butanesulfinyl imine into a wide range of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-1,3-amino alcohols in one step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-assisted, four-component reaction has been developed to synthesize a wide range of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-1,3-amino alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (&lt;i&gt;component-I&lt;/i&gt;) with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;component-II&lt;/i&gt;) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butanesulfinyl imine (&lt;i&gt;component-III&lt;/i&gt;) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (&lt;i&gt;component-IV&lt;/i&gt;). The approach allows diastereoselective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-3-amino-1,5-diols in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The method was illustrated in an efficient, four-step synthesis of piperidine alkaloid (&#8722;)-2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-ethylnorlobelol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Long Persistent Luminescence Through In Situ Generation of Cuprous(I) Ion Pairs in Ionic Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) system based on in situ generated ionic pairs with CuI centers is proposed and demonstrated. Intermediates are proposed and verified through a series of carefully designed experiments. The afterglow of corresponding blends can last more than 3&#8197;hours, thus this mechanism is the first to incorporate CuI ions in OLPL systems.







Abstract
Recent development of most organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems employed binary or tertiary doping. However, the design strategies towards OLPL materials with hour&#8208;long afterglow duration are still quite limited. Here, we propose a novel OLPL system through melt&#8208;casting method with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of CuI complexes: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl BINAP&#8208;CuX (X=Cl, Br and I) doped into the triphenylphosphine (TPP) host. The charge separation was initiated prior to excitation through host coordination with CuI complexes, resulting in semi&#8208;free halogen ions and in situ generated CuI cations, which forms TPP + BINAP&#8208;CuX ionic pairs and subsequently ionic solids. The OLPL lifetime can be readily modulated by different halogen atoms and the afterglow can last up to more than 3&#8197;hours perceivable to human eyes. This is a rare example of OLPL initiated through host&#8208;guest coordination that could potentially expand the definition of OLPL systems and design strategies.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Splicing Strategy for Constructing a Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for UDP&#8208;Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (HHC) for UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) was developed using a &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy. HHC could be used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals. In addition, it could be used to evaluate the bile excretion function and as a high&#8208;throughput screening tool for the rapid discovery of potential UGT1A1 inhibitors.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for the clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity and on&#8211;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, HHC, for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720&#8197;nm after UGT1A1 metabolism. HHC was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function.

         <title>Controlling the Multiple Chiroptical Inversion in Biphasic Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiple chiroptical inversion in Azo biphasic liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) polymers is for the first time realized in&#8197;situ through the tail length modification and degree of polymerization (DP) variation. The amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of three stacking modes, thereby controlling the dynamic reversal of supramolecular chirality.







Abstract
While controlling the chirality and modulating the helicity is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest for gaining a better understanding of the origin of chirality in nature. Herein, structurally similar azobenzene (Azo) vinyl monomers were designed in which the alkyl chains comprised the chiral stereocenter with different achiral tail lengths. Combining the synchronous polymerization, supramolecular stacking and self&#8208;assembly, the multiple chiroptical inversion of the Azo&#8208;polymer supramolecular assemblies can be modulated by the tail length and DP of Azo blocks during in&#8197;situ polymerization. The DP&#8208;, UV light&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, aging time&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties and liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) characterization indicated that the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of intra&#8208;chain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, inter&#8208;chain H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregation, thereby controlling the dynamic multiple reversal of supramolecular chirality.

         <title>A Cooperative OSDA Blueprint for Highly Siliceous Faujasite Zeolite Catalysts with Enhanced Acidity Accessibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative OSDA blueprint for high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites (Si/Al &gt;6) is presented. Only via true cooperation with a crown ether, could trans choline occupy the sod cages of the growing zeolite. Raman&#8208;tracking of the crystallization points to nucleation by the formation of sod&#8208; rather than D6R&#8208; or super&#8208;cages. Reliably low Al&#8208;contents and a unique acidity is thus obtained for a relevant catalytic topology, as validated by plastic waste cracking.







Abstract
A cooperative OSDA strategy is demonstrated, leading to novel high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites with a large potential for disruptive acid catalysis. In bottom&#8208;up synthesis, the symbiosis of choline ion (Ch+) and 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (CE) was evidenced, in a form of full occupation of the sodalite (sod) cages with the trans Ch+ conformer, induced by the CE presence. CE itself occupied the supercages along with additional gauche Ch+, but in synthesis without CE, no trans was found. The cooperation, and thus the fraction of trans Ch+, was closely related to the Si/Al ratio, a key measure for FAU stability and acidity. As such, a bottom&#8208;up handle for lowering the Al&#8208;content of FAU and tuning its acid site distribution is shown. A mechanistic study demonstrated that forming sod cages with trans Ch+ is key to the nucleation of high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites. The materials showed superior performances to commercial FAU zeolites and those synthesized without cooperation, in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene.

         <title>Recovery of the Irreversible Crystallinity of Nanocellulose by Crystallite Fusion: A Strategy for Achieving Efficient Energy Transfers in Sustainable Biopolymer Skeletons**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites are coupled into single fusion crystals without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, thermal energy transfer within the CNF aggregate is significantly improved.







Abstract
Crystallites form a grain boundary or the inter&#8208;crystallite interface. A grain boundary is a structural defect that hinders the efficient directional transfer of mechanical stress or thermal phonons in crystal aggregates. We observed that grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites were coupled into single fusion crystals, without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, the lowered crystallinity of CNFs, which has been considered irreversible, was recovered, and the thermal energy transfer in the aggregate was significantly improved. Other nanofibrous crystallites of chitin also showed a similar fusion phenomenon by enhancing the inter&#8208;crystallite interactions. Such crystallite fusion may naturally occur in biological structures with network skeletons of aggregated fibrillar crystallites having mechanical or thermal functions.

         <title>Tunable and Cooperative Catalysis for Enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction with Varied Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilize diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carboxaldehyde and regioisomers in Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. Compatibility was enabled by fine tuning the achiral carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst in the presence of chiral peptidic squaramide. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by stereoselective synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of medicinally related molecules, including U.S. FDA approved drug&#8208; Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein we report an organocatalytic enantioselective functionalization of heterocyclic carboxaldehydes via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction. Through careful pairing of novel squaramide and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, our method tolerates a breadth of heterocycles, enabling preparation of a series of heterocycle conjugated &#946;&#8208;(tetrahydro)carbolines in good yield and enantioselectivity. Careful selection of carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst is essential for toleration of a variety of regioisomeric heterocycles. Utility is demonstrated via the three&#8208;step stereoselective preparation of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of potent selective estrogen receptor downregulator and U.S. FDA approved drug Tadalafil.

         <title>Stable Interface Chemistry and Multiple Ion Transport of Composite Electrolyte Contribute to Ultra&#8208;long Cycling Solid&#8208;State LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with excellent ion transport capability and stable interface chemistry is developed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability and superior performances of solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/lithium metal batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C. The ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism is identified by solid&#8208;state NMR.







Abstract
Severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and Li metal anode restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which enables the solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries to cycle 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), greatly enhancing its electrochemical stability and suppressing the side reactions. We identify the ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid&#8208;state NMR. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid&#8208;state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Coupling Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Oxidation over Carbon Cloth with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction for Nitrate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) removal from exhaust is necessary because it presents an environmental concern. Previously reported techniques for NO removal are non&#8208;economical and do not utilize NO waste. NO electrocatalytic oxidation served as the anode substitution reaction. Over a piece of carbon cloth, NO elimination, sustainable nitrate synthesis, and hydrogen production were achieved electrocatalytically.







Abstract
NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and sacrifice of value&#8208;added chemicals. Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as a promising anode substitution reaction to couple with the hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V were applied to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.

         <title>Organic Matrix Assisted Low&#8208;temperature Crystallization of Black Phase Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic matrix can assist the crystallization of all&#8208;organic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point of black phase CsPbX3 perovskite. This low&#8208;temperature crystallization takes place through the formation and decomposition of an intermediate state which is reminiscent of an organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite matrix.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskites have attracted increasing attention for applications in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and optoelectronics, including light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs). Cesium lead halide perovskites with tunable I/Br ratios and a band gap aligning with the sunlight region are promising candidates for PSCs. Although impressive progress has been made to improve device efficiency from the initial 2.9&#8201;% with low phase stability to over 20&#8201;% with high stability, there are still questions regarding the perovskite crystal growth mechanism, especially at low temperatures. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in using an organic matrix, including the addition and use of organic ions, polymers, and solvent molecules, for the crystallization of black phase inorganic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point. We also discuss possible mechanisms for this low&#8208;temperature crystallization and their effect on the stability of black phase perovskites. We conclude with an outlook and perspective for further fabrication of large&#8208;scale inorganic perovskites for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Location&#8208;Dependent Lanthanide Selectivity Engineered into Structurally Characterized Designed Coiled Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Location&#8208;dependent size selectivity can be programmed into designed metallo coiled coils, allowing for the generation of near&#8208;identical selective and promiscuous metal&#8208;ion sites. The first crystal structure of a lanthanide bound within a coiled coil, reveal that the existence of an optimal radius stems from the structural constraints of the peptide scaffold. Therefore, a selective site can in principle be designed de novo for any given Ln3+ ion.







Abstract
Herein we report unprecedented location&#8208;dependent, size&#8208;selective binding to designed lanthanide (Ln3+) sites within miniature protein coiled coil scaffolds. Not only do these engineered sites display unusual Ln3+ selectivity for moderately large Ln3+ ions (Nd to Tb), for the first time we demonstrate that selectivity can be location&#8208;dependent and can be programmed into the sequence. A 1&#8197;nm linear translation of the binding site towards the N&#8208;terminus can convert a selective site into a highly promiscuous one. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure, the first of a lanthanide binding site within a coiled coil to be reported, coupled with CD studies, reveal the existence of an optimal radius that likely stems from the structural constraints of the coiled coil scaffold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location&#8208;dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location&#8208;dependent Ln3+ selectivity within a protein.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two biantennary N&#8208;glycans with asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialic acid groups were synthesized through a convergent approach that also enabled the first chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan (see scheme). The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is protected as NAc2 to improve reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylation to the branched mannose in an ether solvent, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylation reactions was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialyl N&#8208;glycans were also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated N&#8208;glycans revealed a difference in the recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effects of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.

         <title>Reversible Dissociation of a Dialumene**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly trans&#8208;bent dialumene has marginal Al=Al double&#8208;bond character and, in solution, can dissociate into monomeric aluminyl fragments. Reactivity studies reveal that both the dialuminene and aluminyl monomer can be trapped by varying the reaction partner. DFT calculations elaborate the origins of the extreme trans&#8208;bending, weak Al=Al bond, and define substituent effects in dialumenes.







Abstract
Dialumenes are neutral AlI compounds with Al=Al multiple bonds. We report the isolation of an amidophosphine&#8208;supported dialumene. Our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational DFT analyses reveal a long and extreme trans&#8208;bent Al=Al bond with a low dissociation energy and bond order. In solution, the dialumene can dissociate into monomeric AlI species. Reactivity studies reveal two modes of reaction: as dialumene or as aluminyl monomers.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Lewis Base&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Umpolung Reactions of Cyclopentadienones and Tropone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclosed the carbonates of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones could form &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;carbodipoles, which would isomerize to interesting &#951;  2  &#8208;Pd(0)&#8208;cyclopentadienone complexes. Compared with the labile parent cyclopentadienone, the HOMO&#8208;energy of the related &#951;  2  &#8208;complex was significantly raised via the back&#8208;bonding of Pd(0) as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base, rendering the uncoordinated C=C bond as an electron&#8208;richer dienophile in inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;type reaction with diverse 1&#8208;azadienes. The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imines)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re&#8208;generated &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species. New C  1  &#8208;symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides, tropone could be similarly activated by a Pd(0) complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/FER vs Pd/SSZ&#8208;13 Passive NOx Adsorbers: Adsorbate&#8208;controlled Location of Atomically Dispersed Pd(II) in FER Determines High Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;loaded FER and SSZ&#8208;13 zeolites as low&#8208;temperature passive NOx adsorbers (PNA) are compared under practical conditions. Vehicle cold&#8208;start exposes the material to CO under a range of concentrations, necessitating a systematic exploration of the effect of CO on the performance of isolated Pd ions in PNA. NO release temperature of both adsorbers decreases gradually with the increase of CO concentration from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm. This beneficial effect results from local nano&#8208;&#8220;hot spot&#8221; formation during CO oxidation. Dissimilar to Pd/SSZ&#8208;13, increasing the CO concentration above ~1,000 ppm improves the NOx storage significantly for Pd/FER, attributed to the presence of Pd ions in FER &#947;&#8208;site that is shielded from NOx. CO mobilizes this Pd atom to the NOx accessible position where it becomes active for PNA. This behavior explains the very high resistance of Pd/FER to hydrothermal aging: Pd/FER materials survive hydrothermal aging at 8000C in 10% H2O vapor for 16 hours with no deterioration in NOx uptake/release behavior. Thus, by allocating Pd ions to the specific microporous pockets in FER, we have produced (hydro)thermally stable and active PNA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Innovative Approach for the Generation of Species of the Interstellar Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser ablation of solid organic compounds with high melting points is proposed for the in situ generation of new chemical species. Diaminomaleonitrile is used as a prototypical precursor, generating numerous interstellar compounds and aminocyanoacetylene for the first time. This experimental method could open the doors towards the discoveries of unsuspected molecules in space.







Abstract
The large amount of unstable species in the realm of interstellar chemistry drives an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the in situ generations of molecules that enable their spectroscopic characterizations. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to decode the molecular universe by matching the interstellar and terrestrial spectra. We propose an approach based on laser ablation of nonvolatile solid organic precursors. The generated chemical species are cooled in a supersonic expansion and probed by high&#8208;resolution microwave spectroscopy. We present a proof of concept through a simultaneous formation of interstellar compounds and the first generation of aminocyanoacetylene using diaminomaleonitrile as a prototypical precursor. With this micro&#8208;laboratory, we open the door to generation of unsuspected species using precursors not typically accessible to traditional techniques such as electric discharge and pyrolysis.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented thiiranation controlled by chiral dirhodium catalysts combined with a highly stereospecific thiirane reduction render the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination a stereoselective process (see scheme). The fourfold stereogenicity of pertinent overcrowded alkenes was thereby tractable with divergent stereocontrol, thus enabling access to all four stereoisomers from identical substrates.







Abstract
Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules owing to their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors, while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and with chiral auxiliaries. Herein we report that direct catalyst control is achieved by a stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination with enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol for various bistricyclic aromatic enes. Using Rh2(S&#8208;PTAD)4 as catalyst, several diazo compounds were selectively coupled with a thioketone to give one of the four anti&#8208;folded overcrowded alkene stereoisomers upon reduction. Complete stereodivergence was reached by catalyst control in combination with distinct thiirane reductions to provide all four stereoisomers with e.r. values of up to 99:1. We envision that this strategy will enable the synthesis of topologically unique overcrowded alkenes for functional materials, catalysis, energy&#8208; and electron transfer, and bioactive compounds.

         <title>Photoinduced Trifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Catalyzed by High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes with simple naphthyridine ligands undergo facile aerobic oxidation to stable, isolated NiIII organometallic complexes, in which Ni&#8211;CF3 bond homolysis is observed upon irradiation with blue LED light. These complexes catalyze photoinduced C&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation in arenes and heteroarenes.







Abstract
We describe a series of air&#8208;stable NiIII complexes supported by a simple, robust naphthyridine&#8208;based ligand. Access to the high&#8208;valent oxidation state is enabled by the CF3 ligands on the nickel, while the naphthyridine exhibits either a monodentate or bidentate coordination mode that depends on the oxidation state and sterics, and enables facile aerobic oxidation of NiII to NiIII. These NiIII complexes act as efficient catalysts for photoinduced C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation reactions of (hetero)arenes using versatile synthetic protocols. This blue LED light&#8208;mediated catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical pathway and demonstrates potential in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogs.

         <title>Printed Nanochain&#8208;Based Colorimetric Assay for Quantitative Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A printed nanochain&#8208;based colorimetric assay is utilized for point&#8208;of&#8208;care quantitative testing and real&#8208;time monitoring of viral infection with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. It enables rapid detection of various pathogens from tiny amounts of clinical sample with a smartphone.







Abstract
Fast and ultrasensitive detection of pathogens is very important for efficient monitoring and prevention of viral infections. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free optical detection approach that uses a printed nanochain assay for colorimetric quantitative testing of viruses. The antibody&#8208;modified nanochains have high activity and specificity which can rapidly identify target viruses directly from biofluids in 15&#8194;min, as well as differentiate their subtypes. Arising from the resonance induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the color of nanochains changes with the binding of viruses that are easily observed by a smartphone. We achieve the detection limit of 1&#8197;PFU&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1 through optimizing the optical response of nanochains in visible region. Besides, it allows for real&#8208;time response to virus concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0&#215;105&#8197;PFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. This low&#8208;cost and portable platform is also applicable to rapid detection of other biomarkers, making it attractive for many clinical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A printed nanochain-based colorimetric assay is utilized for point-of-care quantitative testing and real-time monitoring of viral infection with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. It enables rapid detection of various pathogens from tiny amounts of clinical sample with a smartphone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast and ultrasensitive detection of pathogens is very important for efficient monitoring and prevention of viral infections. Here, we demonstrate a label-free optical detection approach that uses a printed nanochain assay for colorimetric quantitative testing of viruses. The antibody-modified nanochains have high activity and specificity which can rapidly identify target viruses directly from biofluids in 15 min, as well as differentiate their subtypes. Arising from the resonance induced near-field enhancement, the color of nanochains changes with the binding of viruses that are easily observed by a smartphone. We achieve the detection limit of 1&#8197;PFU&#8201;&#956;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; through optimizing the optical response of nanochains in visible region. Besides, it allows for real-time response to virus concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;PFU&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This low-cost and portable platform is also applicable to rapid detection of other biomarkers, making it attractive for many clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Archetypal Homoleptic Lanthanide Quadruple&#8208;Decker&#8212;Synthesis, Mechanistic Studies, and Quantum Chemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The synthesis of the first well&#8208;defined neutral and homoleptic (same metal, same ligand) all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based quadruple&#8208;decker complexes [SmIII/II/III3(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6)) along with other unique sandwich complexes is shown.







Abstract
Reduction of [SmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)(BH4)(thf)] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) with KC8 resulted in [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4], the first example of a homoleptic lanthanide quadruple&#8208;decker. As indicated by an analysis of the bond metrics in the solid&#8208;state, the inner Sm ion is present in the divalent oxidation state, while the outer ones are trivalent. This observation could be confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Mechanistic studies revealed not only insight into possible formation pathways of [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] but also resulted in the transformation to other mixed metal sandwich complexes with unique structural properties. These are the 1D&#8208;polymeric chain structured [KSmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)]n and the hexametallic species [(tol)K(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)SmII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)K]2 which were initially envisioned as possible building blocks as part of different retrosynthetically guided pathways that we developed.

         <title>An Overlooked Natural Hydrogen Evolution Pathway: Ni2+ Boosting H2O Reduction by Fe(OH)2 Oxidation during Low&#8208;Temperature Serpentinization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient natural H2 production during Lt&#8208;serpentinization through water reduction by Fe(OH)2 oxidation has been experimentally identified for the first time. This finding provides a new insight to explore the natural H2, which originated from the Ni2+ rich ultramafic rocks.







Abstract
Natural hydrogen (H2) has gained considerable attentions as a renewable energy resource to mitigate the globally increasing environmental concerns. Low&#8208;temperature serpentinization (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) as a typical water&#8211;rock reaction is a major source of the natural H2. However, the reaction mechanism and the controlling step to product H2 remained unclear, which hinders the further utilization of natural H2. Herein, we demonstrated that the H2 production rate could be determined by the Fe(OH)2 oxidation during low&#8208;temperature serpentinization. Moreover, the co&#8208;existence of Ni2+ could largely enhance the H2 production kinetics. With the addition of only 1&#8201;% Ni2+, the H2 production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90&#8201;&#176;C. D2O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H2 production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni2+ to promote the reduction of H2O.

         <title>Ring Expansion Fluorination of Unactivated Cyclopropanes Mediated by a New Monofluoroiodane(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for C&#8722;C bond cleavage and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes has been developed. The reaction consists of C&#8722;C bond scission and ring expansion fluorination, which are both promoted by a novel hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent&#8197;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new strategy for carbon&#8722;carbon bond scission and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes, which was accomplished with a new hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent 1. This novel method delivers medicinally relevant 4&#8208;fully substituted fluoropiperidines in moderate to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Reagent 1, which has an N&#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, was readily synthesized via three steps in 76&#8201;% overall yield and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Owing to the presence of a secondary I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonding interaction between the &#955;3&#8208;iodane atom and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the N&#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, 1 has excellent stability and can be stored at ambient temperature for 6&#8197;months without any detectable decomposition. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate that readily combines with a fluoride ion to generate the product.

         <title>Insight on the Order of Regioselective Ultrafast Formation of Disulfide Bonds in (Antimicrobial) Peptides and Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective palladium catalysis used for the regioselective ultrafast synthesis of peptides and proteins bearing multiple disulfide bonds provided important insight into the order of oxidation (see picture). The approach, which produced a novel antimicrobial plectasin derivative with enhanced antibiotic activity relative to that of the natural product, should enable the practical synthesis of peptide/protein libraries for various applications.







Abstract
Disulfide&#8208;rich peptides and proteins are among the most fascinating bioactive molecules. The difficulties associated with the preparation of these targets have prompted the development of various chemical strategies. Nevertheless, the production of these targets remains very challenging or elusive. Recently, we introduced a strategy for one&#8208;pot disulfide bond formation, tackling most of the previous limitations. However, the effect of the order of oxidation remained an underexplored issue. Herein we report on the complete synthetic flexibility of the approach with respect to the order of oxidation of three disulfide bonds in targets that lack the knot motif. In contrast, our study reveals an essential order of disulfide bond formation in the EETI&#8208;II knotted miniprotein. This synthetic strategy was applied for the synthesis of novel analogues of the plectasin antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a notorious human pathogen.

         <title>Commercial Cu2Cr2O5 Decorated with Iron Carbide Nanoparticles as Multifunctional Catalyst for Magnetically Induced Continuous Flow Hydrogenation of Aromatic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial copper chromite is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles using a simple and versatile method, producing a magnetically activable multifunctional catalytic system. This system (ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  ) is able to reduce aromatic ketones to aromatic alcohols when exposed to a high frequency alternating current magnetic field,  i.e.  magnetic induction. Under magnetic excitation, the ICNPs generate locally confined hot spots, activating selectively the Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  surface while the global temperature of the reaction mixture remains low (~ 80&#176;C). The ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  catalyst selectively hydrogenates a scope of benzylic and non&#8208;benzylic ketones under these mild conditions (3 bar H  2  , heptane), while ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  or Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  are inactive when the same global temperature is adjusted by conventional heating. A flow reactor is presented allowing the combined use of magnetic induction for continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation at elevated pressure. The excellent catalytic properties of ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  for the hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfuralacetone are conserved for at least 17 hours on stream, demonstrating for the first time the application of a magnetically heated catalyst to a continuously operated hydrogenation reaction in the liquid phase. The reported approach for the decoration of solid materials with magnetically activated nanoparticles may be applied to a wide range of heterogeneous catalysts, generalizing the access to potential advantages associated with magnetic induction in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Mediated N2&#8208;Splitting and Functionalization in the Presence of a Coordinated Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new [PCCP]&#8208;coordinated molybdenum platform com&#173;pris&#173;ing a coordinated alkyne was employed for the cleavage of molecular di&#173;nitrogen. The coordinated  &#414;  2  &#8208;alkyne was left unaffected during this re&#173;duction. DFT calculations sug&#173;gest that the reaction proceeds via an initially generated terminal N  2  &#8208;complex, which is converted to a di&#173;nuc&#173;lear  &#181;  &#8208;(  &#414;  1  :  &#414;  1  )&#8208;N  2  &#8208;bridged inter&#173;mediate prior to N&#8211;N bond cleavage. Pro&#173;tonation, alkylation and acyl&#173;ation of the resulting molybdenum nitrido complex led to the corres&#173;ponding  N  &#8208;functionalized imido com&#173;plexes. Upon oxidation of the  N  &#8208;acylated imido derivative in MeCN, a fumaro&#173;nitrile fragment was built up via C&#8210;C coupling of MeCN to af&#173;ford a dinuclear molybdenum complex. The key finding that the strong N&#8801;N bond may be cleaved in the presence of a weaker, but spatially constrained C&#8801;C bond contra&#173;dicts the widespread paradigm that coordinated alkynes are in general more reactive than gaseous N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Peptide Dendrimer Inspired from Glatiramer Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random polypeptide drug used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. With the aim of identifying a precisely defined alternative to GA, we synthesized a library of peptide dendrimers with an amino acid composition similar to GA. We then challenged the dendrimers to trigger the release of the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;1 receptor antagonist (IL&#8208;1Ra) from human monocytes, which is one of the effects of GA on immune cells. Several of the largest dendrimers tested were as active as GA. Detailed profiling of the best hit showed that this dendrimer induces the differentiation of monocytes towards an M2 (anti&#8208;inflammatory) state as GA does, however with a distinct immune marker profile. Our peptide dendrimer might serve as starting point to develop a well&#8208;defined immunomodulatory analog of GA.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Substitution with Copper(I) Homoenolates Generated from Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using copper(I) homoenolates as nucleophiles, which are generated through the ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols, a catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with allyl phosphates is achieved in high to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Both 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols and allylic phosphates enjoy broad substrate scopes. Remarkably, various functional groups, such as ether, ester, tosylate, imide, alcohol, nitro, and carbamate are well tolerated. Moreover, the present method is nicely extended to the asymmetric construction of quaternary carbon centers. Some control experiments argue against a radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism and a catalytic cycle based on a two&#8208;electron process is proposed. Finally, the synthetic utilities of the product are showcased by means of the transformations of the terminal olefin group and the ketone group.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore&#8208;Bound Water at the Key Residue Histidine&#8197;37 in Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water structure impacts biological processes. Within the Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2 proton channel, a bound water molecule proton was detected at a chemical shift of 11&#8197;ppm. Combining magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and quantum chemical calculations, the water was found hydrogen bonded to N&#948;1 of the functional histidine&#8197;37 residue.







Abstract
Atomic details of structured water molecules are indispensable to understand the thermodynamics of important biological processes including the proton conduction mechanism of the M2 protein. Despite the expectation of structured water molecules based on crystal structures of Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2, only two water populations have been observed by NMR in reconstituted lipid bilayer samples. These are the bulk&#8208; and lipid&#8208;associated water populations typically seen in membrane samples. Here, we detect a bound water molecule at a chemical shift of 11&#8197;ppm, located near the functional histidine&#8197;37 residue in the M2 conductance domain, which comprises residues 18 to 60. Combining 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and density functional theory calculations, we show that the bound water forms a hydrogen bond to the &#948;1 nitrogen of histidine&#8197;37.

         <title>Electron Localization and Lattice Strain Induced by Surface Lithium Doping Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Formate from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value&#8208;added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped tin (s&#8208;SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus leading to both the activity and selectivity enhancement of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s&#8208;SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate performances, including a partial current density of &#8722;1.0 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92%. Furthermore, Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &gt; 800 cycles. Our work suggests an efficient approach to incorporate the electron localization and lattice strain as the active catalytic sites to synergistically achieve highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.</dc:description>

Furthermore, Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries equipped with the s-SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &amp;gt; 800 cycles. Our work suggests an efficient approach to incorporate the electron localization and lattice strain as the active catalytic sites to synergistically achieve highly efficient CO2-to-formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Glutarimides: Alternative Cereblon Binders for the Design of PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting cereblon (CRBN) is currently one of the most frequently reported proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) approaches, owing to favorable drug&#8208;like properties of CRBN ligands, immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs). However, IMiDs are known to be inherently unstable, readily undergoing hydrolysis in body fluids. Here we show that IMiDs and IMiD&#8208;based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel CRBN binders, phenyl glutarimide (PG) analogues, and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN with high ligand efficiency (LE &gt;0.48) and displayed improved chemical stability. Our efforts led to the discovery of PG PROTAC  4c  (SJ995973), a uniquely potent degrader of bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) proteins that inhibited the viability of human acute myeloid leukemia MV4&#8208;11 cells at low picomolar concentrations (IC  50  = 3 pM; BRD4 DC  50  = 0.87 nM). These findings strongly support the utility of PG derivatives in the design of CRBN&#8208;directed PROTACs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;&#8208;Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N&#8208;aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene 2b. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of 2b towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes 3&#8208;6 with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the Al center in 2b can behave as: 1. a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; 2. a &#963;&#8208;donating, &#963;&#8208;accepting and &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; and 3. a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#963;&#8208;accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of 2b with IDippCuCl (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu&#8208;alumanyl complex 8. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for Inhibition of ROS&#8208;Producing Respiratory Complex I by NADH&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nM concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR failed. Here, we report by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis the structure of NADH&#8208;OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0 &#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues specific and essential for binding NADH&#8208;OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH&#8208;OH towards the unique Rossmann&#8208;fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role for mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH&#8208;OH displays a lead&#8208;structure for synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Piezocatalysis: Energy Band Theory or Screening Charge Effect?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezocatalysis, a new&#8208;emerging catalysis technology relying on catalyst&#8217;s piezopotential and piezoelectric property, is attracting unprecedented research enthusiasm for applications in energy conversion, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism for piezocatalysis is still in debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles should be enhanced to further advance this technology for future piezocatalysts design and system optimization. In this article, we review the two popular theories to explain the observed piezocatalysis in terms of the energy band theory and the screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the difference, relevance, evidence and contradiction of the two mechanisms is provided. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of the future mechanic study are put forward. Hopefully, this review can help readers to gain a better understanding and to start quickly in applying piezocatalysis to their own research.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Semisynthesis of Lipidated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipidation is a ubiquitous modification of peptides and proteins that can occur either co&#8208; or post&#8208;translationally. An array of different lipid classes can adorn proteins and has been shown to influence a number of crucial biological activities, including the regulation of signaling, cell&#8208;cell adhesion events, and the anchoring of proteins to lipid rafts and phospholipid membranes. Lipid modifications discovered to date include prenylation, such as  S  &#8208;farnesylation and  S  &#8208;geranylgeranylation,  S  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;palmitoylation,  N  &#8209;myristoylation, as well as the attachment of cholesterol, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) anchors to the C&#8208;terminus of proteins. While nature employs a range of enzymes to install lipid modifications onto proteins, the use of these for chemoenzymatic generation of lipidated proteins is often inefficient or impractical. An alternative is to harness the power of modern synthetic and semisynthetic technologies to access lipid&#8208;modified proteins in pure and homogeneously modified form. This review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of lipidation and ligation chemistry and their implementation in the synthesis and semisynthesis of homogeneously lipidated proteins that have enabled the influence of these modifications on protein structure and function to be uncovered.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Cu&#8208;Doped SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n Heterostructure That Shows Significant Raman Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2  &#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2  &#8208;NiOx/Cu), was first created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46 &#215; 1010  . This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;separation efficacy of p&#8208;n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner&#8208;reference element, SnO2  &#8208;NiOx/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs was recorded in a barcode, demonstrating practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.</dc:description>

         <title>High Density Polyethylenes Bearing Isolated In&#8208;Chain Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene materials are highly important polymers which are produced in the largest volume among all plastics. Due to the chemical inert property of saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the degradation of polyethylene is extremely challenging, which prevents them from efficient chemical recycling. Installing functional groups in the main chain of polyethylenes may facilitate the degradation and following chemical recycling of polyethylene materials. Here we report a highly selective approach for the synthesis of high density polyethylenes bearing low content isolated in&#8208;chain carbonyls. Linear high&#8208;molecular weight polyethylene chains are synthesized via the palladium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with metal carbonyls. Different from traditional ethylene/CO copolymerization reactions, excellent non&#8208;alternating selectivity has been achieved. While the properties of polyethylene have been retained in the copolymer, faster degradation compared with that of polyethylene was observed upon UV light irradiation. The synthesized materials may therefore serve as more environmentally friendly alternative plastics than traditional polyethylene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Splitting by a C60 Supported Single Vanadium Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60  supported vanadium atom, C60V+  + H2O &#8594; C60VO+  + H2  . We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+  , and observe the formation of H2  as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60  &#8208;supported V+  , whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+  ion by a high energy barrier. The C60  support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70 kJ/mol due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60  support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60  &#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;linked poly&#8208;4&#8208;acrylomorpholine: a flexible and reversibly compressible aligning gel for anisotropic NMR analysis of peptides and small molecules in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determination of the solution conformation of both small organic molecules and peptides in water remains a substantial hurdle in using NMR solution conformations to guide drug design due to the lack of easy to use alignment media. Herein we report the design of a flexible compressible chemically cross&#8208;linked poly&#8208;4&#8208;acrylomorpholine gel that can be used for the alignment of both small molecules and cyclic peptides in water. To test the new gel, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and  J  &#8208;coupling constants were used in the configurational analysis of strychnine hydrochloride, a molecule that has been studied extensively in organic solvents as well as a small cyclic peptide that is known to form an a&#8208;helix in water. The conformational ensembles for each molecule with the best fit to the data are reported. Identification of minor conformers in water that cannot easily be determined by conventional NOE measurements will facilitate the use of RDC experiments in structure&#8208;based drug design.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>3,7,23,27&#8208;Tetrabromo&#8208;[36]octaphyrin  2  was synthesized as a novel octaphyrin bearing two  meso  &#8208;free positions. Surprisingly, its Zn  II  and Ni  II  complexation reactions produced a directly fused porphyrin(2.1.1.1) dimer  6  , and a  meso&#8208;&#945;  fused N&#8208;confused porphyrin (NCP) dimer  7  , as the first example of NCP tape, respectively,  via  transannular C&#8211;C bond formation. While  6  exhibits a diatropic ring&#8208;current effect owing to the global 36&#960; M&#246;bius aromaticity,  7  shows a paratropic ring&#8208;current effect due to the global H&#252;ckel 36&#960; antiaromaticity.

         <title>Visualization of Vaccine Dynamics with Quantum Dots for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visualization of spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines is achieved with synthetic QDs for potent immune activation.







Abstract
The direct visualization of vaccine fate is important to investigate its immunoactivation process to elucidate the detailed molecular reaction process at single&#8208;molecular level. Yet, visualization of the spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines remains poorly explored. Here, we show that quantum dot (QD) nanomaterials allow for monitoring vaccine dynamics and for amplified immune response. Synthetic QDs enable efficient conjugation of antigen and adjuvants to target tissues and cells, and non&#8208;invasive imaging the trafficking dynamics to lymph nodes and cellular compartments. The nanoparticle vaccine elicits potent immune responses and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. The synthetic QDs showed high fluorescence quantum yield and superior photostability, and the reliable and long&#8208;term spatiotemporal tracking of vaccine dynamics was realized for the first time by using the synthetic QDs, providing a powerful strategy for studying immune response and evaluating vaccine efficacy.

         <title>Accelerated Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation with Humic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Supported Electron&#8208;Deficient Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A humic&#8208;acid&#8208;based carbonaceous support material AHA_U_400 was prepared through mild thermal condensation and cross&#8208;linking between artificial humic acid and urea, and the material proved to enable the preparation of the stable Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt1@AHA_U_400). Pt was coordinated to two unsaturated O atoms, as well as one Cl&#8722; and one HCl moiety.







Abstract
The hydrosilylation reaction is one of the largest&#8208;scale applications of homogeneous catalysis, and Pt homogeneous catalysts have been widely used in this reaction for the commercial manufacture of silicon products. However, homogeneous Pt catalysts result in considerable problems, such as undesired side reactions, unacceptable catalyst residues and disposable platinum consumption. Here, we synthesized electron&#8208;deficient Pt single atoms supported on humic matter (Pt1@AHA_U_400), and the catalyst was used in hydrosilylation reactions, which showed super activity (turnover frequency as high as 3.0&#215;107&#8197;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high performance of the catalyst results from the atomic dispersion of Pt and the electron deficiency of the Pt1 atoms, which is different from conventional Pt nanoscale catalysts. Excellent performance is maintained during recycle experiments, indicating the high stability of the catalyst.

         <title>Dirhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective B&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;Diaryl Carbenes: Efficient Access to gem&#8208;Diarylmethine Boranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14&#8201;300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The scarcity of reliable methods for synthesizing chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borons limits their applications. Herein, we report a method for highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14&#8201;300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance. The borane compounds synthesized by this method could be efficiently transformed into diaryl methanol, diaryl methyl amine, and triaryl methane derivatives with good stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies suggested that the borane adduct coordinated to the rhodium catalyst and thus interfered with decomposition of the diazomethane, and that insertion of a rhodium carbene (generated from the diaryl diazomethane) into the B&#8722;H bond was most likely the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aza&#8208;Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling To Form Ynimines: Development and Application to the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynimines that are usually difficult to access were readily prepared from simple starting materials under Cu catalysis. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation was subsequently developed for the synthesis of aza&#8208;heterocycles, such as isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines (see scheme).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;substituted alkynes, such as ynamines and ynamides, are versatile synthetic building blocks. Ynimines bearing additional nucleophilic and electrophilic centers relative to ynamines and ynamides are expected to have high synthetic potential. However, their chemical reactivity remains unexplored owing mainly to the lack of synthetic accessibility. We report herein a versatile copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ynimines from readily available O&#8208;acetyl ketoximes and terminal alkynes. A wide range of O&#8208;acetyl ketoximes derived from diaryl ketones, aryl alkyl ketones and dialkyl ketones underwent cross&#8208;coupling with a diverse set of terminal alkynes to afford the ynimines in good to excellent yields. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation reaction exploiting the reactivity of the ynimine generated in situ was subsequently developed for the synthesis of medicinally important heterocycles, including isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines.

         <title>Metathesis Cascade&#8208;Triggered Depolymerization of Enyne Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are developed to enable cascade depolymerization triggered by metathesis catalysts. Stable in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, and at elevated temperatures, these enyne SIPs can undergo efficient depolymerization in response to external stimuli. This work established a general approach to stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled release of heterocyclic reagents.







Abstract
A novel class of enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) capable of metathesis cascade&#8208;triggered depolymerization is reported. Studies on model compounds established 1,6&#8208;enyne structures for efficient metathesis cascade reactions. SIPs incorporating the optimized 1,6&#8208;enyne motif were prepared via both polycondensation and iterative exponential growth approaches. These SIPs demonstrated excellent stability in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, or at elevated temperatures, and can undergo efficient and complete depolymerization once triggered by a metathesis catalyst. Further studies revealed that introducing a terminal alkene to the chain end of the enyne SIPs improved the depolymerization efficiency, and established their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Microscale Interfacial Polymerization on a Chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEG&#8208;based hydrogels can be precisely localized in capillary&#8208;driven microfluidic chips by in situ interfacial polymerization. This allows using hydrogels for filtration, studying diffusion processes of solutes across the hydrogels and rapid bioassays.







Abstract
Forming hydrogels with precise geometries is challenging and mostly done using photopolymerization, which involves toxic chemicals, rinsing steps, solvents, and bulky optical equipment. Here, we introduce a new method for in situ formation of hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined geometry in a sealed microfluidic chip by interfacial polymerization. The geometry of the hydrogel is programmed by microfluidic design using capillary pinning structures and bringing into contact solutions containing hydrogel precursors from vicinal channels. The characteristics of the hydrogel (mesh size, molecular weight cut&#8208;off) can be readily adjusted. This method is compatible with capillary&#8208;driven microfluidics, fast, uses small volumes of reagents and samples, and does not require specific laboratory equipment. Our approach creates opportunities for filtration, hydrogel functionalization, and hydrogel&#8208;based assays, as exemplified by a rapid, compact competitive immunoassay that does not require a rinsing step.

         <title>General, Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Carbon Nanofiber Assemblies from Plant Oils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanofibers can be conveniently prepared from plant oils in the presence of P2O5, using long&#8208;neglected Staudinger carbene chemistry. The fibers are shown to be electronically highly conductive and are exemplarily used for capacitive deionization.







Abstract
We designed a metal&#8208;free synthesis of carbon nanofiber based on ketene chemistry using phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and vegetable oil. Based on the characterization of intermediates, P2O5&#8208;oil reaction yielded most possibly alkylketenes, which polymerized into poly(ketene) with abundant enol groups. The enol groups further reacted with P2O5, forcing the poly(ketene) to assemble into a nano&#8208;sized preassembly structure. Moderate heating transforms these structures into carbonaceaus nanofibers. This approach is applicable to other chemicals with similar structure to vegetable oil. The carbon nanofibers with P&#8208;O&#8208;C functionalization show relatively high graphitization degree and promising textural properties. The C&#8208;O&#8208;P environment accounts for 66&#8197;at&#8201;% of the total P and creates a superior thermal stability. As a model application, a CDI system built of a carbon&#8208;nanofiber&#8208;based electrode countered by an activated carbon&#8208;based electrode exhibited exceptional performance.

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclopropanations via Enzyme&#8208;Bound Iminium Ion Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a promiscuous 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) resulted in an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme that promotes the stereoselective addition of diethyl 2&#8208;chloromalonate to substituted cinnamaldehydes to afford various cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity.







Abstract
Cyclopropane rings are an important structural motif frequently found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. Commonly, biocatalytic methodologies for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropanes rely on repurposed or artificial heme enzymes. Here, we engineered an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme based on a promiscuous tautomerase for the enantioselective synthesis of various cyclopropanes via the nucleophilic addition of diethyl 2&#8208;chloromalonate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The engineered enzyme promotes formation of the two new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds with excellent stereocontrol over both stereocenters, affording the desired cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity (d.r. up to 25:1; e.r. up to 99:1). Our results highlight the usefulness of promiscuous enzymes for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Guanosine Tetra&#8208; and Pentaphosphate (p)ppGpp with RNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Sensors**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically encodable fluorescent RNA sensors are engineered to detect (p)ppGpp in live cells. Under nutrient starvation, cells produce and accumulate (p)ppGpp as a response, which can now be observed using these sensors.







Abstract
Guanosine tetra&#8208; and pentaphosphate, (p)ppGpp, are important alarmone nucleotides that regulate bacterial survival in stressful environment. A direct detection of (p)ppGpp in living cells is critical for our understanding of the mechanism of bacterial stringent response. However, it is still challenging to image cellular (p)ppGpp. Here, we report RNA&#8208;based fluorescent sensors for the live&#8208;cell imaging of (p)ppGpp. Our sensors are engineered by conjugating a recently identified (p)ppGpp&#8208;specific riboswitch with a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, Broccoli. These sensors can be genetically encoded and enable direct monitoring of cellular (p)ppGpp accumulation. Unprecedented information on cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variation and cellular dynamics of (p)ppGpp levels is now obtained under different nutritional conditions. These RNA&#8208;based sensors can be broadly adapted to study bacterial stringent response.

         <title>Lewis Pair Catalyzed Regioselective Polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;Alkyl Sorbates for the Synthesis of (AB)n Sequenced Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis pairs were applied for living/controlled and 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of sustainable (E,E)&#8208;alkyl sorbates. Poly((E,E)&#8208;alkyl sorbates) could be further converted into various polymers with strict (AB)n sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene).







Abstract
In this contribution, Lewis pairs (LPs) composed of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) with different steric hindrance and nucleophilicity as Lewis bases (LBs) and Al&#8208;based compounds with comparable acidity but different steric hindrance as Lewis acids (LAs) were applied for 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;methyl sorbate (MS) and (E,E)&#8208;ethyl sorbate (ES). The effects of steric hindrance, electron&#8208;donating ability, and acidity of LPs on MS and ES polymerization were systematically investigated. High catalytic activity and high initiation efficiency can be achieved, leading to the formation of PMS with 100&#8201;% 1,4&#8208;selectivity, tunable molecular weight (Mw up to 333&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD). Block copolymerization of ES and methyl methacrylate (MMA) was also realized. Meanwhile, this system can be applied to other homologous conjugated diene substrates. Furthermore, simple chemical reactions can efficiently convert PMS to different polymers with strict (AB)n sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene).

         <title>Distorted Sandwich &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII Catalyst: Linear Polyethylene and Synthesis of Ethylene/Acrylate Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distorted sandwich &#945;&#8208;diimine PdII catalysts with m&#8208;xylyl groups for axial shielding of the metal center provide living polymerization of linear polyethylene with low branching to be turned into either hard plastics or thermoplastic elastomers incorporating a range of acrylates in a one&#8208;pot by metal&#8208;organic insertion light&#8208;initiated polymerization.







Abstract
The introduction of m&#8208;xylyl substituents to &#945;&#8208;diimine PdII catalyst promotes living ethylene polymerization at room temperature and low pressure to yield high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) with low branching (&lt;17/1000&#8197;C). m&#8208;Xylyl groups provide a highly effective blockage to the axial sites of the catalytic center and form a distorted sandwich geometry. The shielding prevents chain&#8208;transfer and easy accessibility of polar monomers, leading to a living polymerization. Conducting a light irradiation as part of the one&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic insertion light initiated radical (MILRad) process leads to diblock copolymers of ethylene and acrylates. Incorporation of different acrylate block sequences can significantly modify the mechanical and chemical properties of block copolymers which can be modulated to be a hard plastic, elastomer, or semi&#8208;amorphous polymer.

         <title>Application of Relaxation Dispersion of Hyperpolarized 13C Spins to Protein&#8211;Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change in the 13C transverse nuclear spin relaxation rate, also known as relaxation dispersion, is a sensitive parameter for determining the ligand binding mode in a protein binding site by NMR. The measurement of the 13C relaxation dispersion is enabled by the sensitivity gain of several thousand&#8208;fold provided by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization.







Abstract
Nuclear spin relaxation dispersion parameters are proposed as indicators of the binding mode of a ligand to a protein. Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (D&#8208;DNP) provided a 13C signal enhancement between 3000&#8211;6000 for the ligand 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) benzene&#8208;1&#8208;carboximidamide binding to trypsin. The measurement of 13C R2 relaxation dispersion was enabled without isotope enrichment, using a series of single&#8208;scan Carr&#8211;Purcell&#8211;Meiboom&#8211;Gill experiments with variable refocusing delays. The magnitude in dispersion for the spins of the ligand is correlated to the position with respect to the salt bridge between protein and the amidine group of the ligand, indicating the ligand binding orientation. Hyperpolarized relaxation dispersion is an alternative to chemical shift or NOE measurements for determining ligand binding modes.

         <title>Chiral Selectivity of Secondary Nucleation in Amyloid Fibril Propagation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid&#8208;forming peptides are chiral substances. While the growth of amyloid fibrils is known to be enantiospecific, we show here that this applies also to secondary nucleation of monomers in the presence of fibrils. Secondary nucleation is only possible if the monomers in solution and aggregate are of the same chirality.







Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental feature of asymmetric molecules and of critical importance for intermolecular interactions. The growth of amyloid fibrils displays a strong enantioselectivity, which is manifested as elongation through the addition of monomers of the same, but not opposite, chirality as the parent aggregate. Here we ask whether also secondary nucleation on the surface of amyloid fibrils, of relevance for toxicity, is governed by the chirality of the nucleating monomers. We use short amyloid peptides (A&#946;20&#8208;34 and IAPP20&#8208;29) with all residues as L&#8208; or all D&#8208;enantiomer in self and cross&#8208;seeding experiments with low enough seed concentration that any acceleration of fibril formation is dominated by secondary nucleation. We find a strong enantio&#8208;specificity of this auto&#8208;catalytic process with secondary nucleation being observed in the self&#8208;seeding experiments only. The results highlight a role of secondary nucleation in strain propagation.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Dipnictadialanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pnictaalenes with a pnictogen&#8722;aluminium double bond are inherently unstable and prone to dimerization. The synthesis of Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;free dipnictadialenes is revealed. It is shown that depending on the steric profile of the substituents either the alternating [CpxAl(&#956;&#8208;PAr)]2 dimers or the head&#8208;to&#8208;head species [ArPnAlCp3t]2 are formed. DFT studies corroborate that the different outcomes are thermodynamically driven.







Abstract
Using the AlI precursor Cp3tAl in conjunction with triphosphiranes (PAr)3 (Ar=Mes, Dip, Tip) we have succeeded in preparing Lewis base&#8208;free cyclic diphosphadialanes with both the Al and P&#8197;atoms bearing three substituents. Using the sterically more demanding Dip and Tip substituents the first 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialuminacyclobutanes were obtained, whereas with Mes substituents [Cp3tAl(&#956;&#8208;PMes)]2 is formed. This divergent reactivity was corroborated by DFT studies, which indicated the thermodynamic preference for the 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialuminacyclobutane form for sterically more demanding groups on phosphorus. Using Cp*Al we could extend this concept to the corresponding cyclic diarsadialanes [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;AsAr)]2 (Ar=Dip, Tip) and additionally add the phosphorus variants [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;PAr)]2 (P=Mes, Dip, Tip). The reactivity of one variant [Cp3tAl(&#956;&#8208;PPh)]2 towards NHCs was tested and resulted in double NHC&#8208;stabilised [Cp3t(IiPr2)Al(&#956;&#8208;PPh)]2.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Compositions for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines kinetic modeling and density functional theory calculations with Bayesian optimization to find optimal alloy compositions for the oxygen reduction reaction while sampling a minimum number of compositions. Starting from the Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru and Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Rh&#8208;Ru alloy systems, the discovered optimal Ag&#8211;Pd, Ir&#8211;Pt, and Pd&#8211;Ru alloys are subsequently validated experimentally.







Abstract
Active, selective and stable catalysts are imperative for sustainable energy conversion, and engineering materials with such properties are highly desired. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) offer a vast compositional space for tuning such properties. Too vast, however, to traverse without the proper tools. Here, we report the use of Bayesian optimization on a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict the most active compositions for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the least possible number of sampled compositions for the two HEAs Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru and Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Rh&#8208;Ru. The discovered optima are then scrutinized with DFT and subjected to experimental validation where optimal catalytic activities are verified for Ag&#8211;Pd, Ir&#8211;Pt, and Pd&#8211;Ru binary alloys. This study offers insight into the number of experiments needed for optimizing the vast compositional space of multimetallic alloys which has been determined to be on the order of 50 for ORR on these HEAs.

         <title>Hydrosulfide (HS&#8722;) Recognition and Sensing in Water by Halogen Bonding Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible chemosensing of hydrosulfide (HS&#8722;) in pure water is demonstrated using halogen bonding (XB) fluorescent hosts. The XB receptors exhibit characteristic selective quenching of fluorescence upon binding HS&#8722; whereas the hydrogen bonding receptor analogues proved incapable of functioning as chemosensors under aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a crucial signalling role in a variety of physiological systems, existing as the hydrosulfide anion (HS&#8722;) at physiological pH. Combining the potency of halogen bonding (XB) for anion recognition in water with coumarin fluorophore incorporation in acyclic host structural design, the first XB receptors to bind and, more importantly, sense the hydrosulfide anion in pure water in a reversible chemosensing fashion are demonstrated. The XB receptors exhibit characteristic selective quenching of fluorescence upon binding to HS&#8722;. Computational DFT and molecular dynamics simulations in water corroborate the experimental anion binding observations, revealing the mode and nature of HS&#8722; recognition by the XB receptors.

         <title>Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experiments and calculations are presented to elucidate the mechanism of nanoconfinement and thermodynamic stabilization of AlH3 inside the pores of a bipyridine&#8208;functionalized cyclic triazine framework, CTF&#8208;bipyridine, which is responsible for the unprecedented reversibility of the hydride under 70&#8197;MPa hydrogen pressure at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The highly unfavorable thermodynamics of direct aluminum hydrogenation can be overcome by stabilizing alane within a nanoporous bipyridine&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework (AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipyridine). This material and the counterpart AlH3@CTF&#8208;biphenyl rapidly desorb H2 between 95 and 154&#8201;&#176;C, with desorption complete at 250&#8201;&#176;C. Sieverts measurements, 27Al MAS NMR and 27Al{1H} REDOR experiments, and computational spectroscopy reveal that AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipyridine dehydrogenation is reversible at 60&#8201;&#176;C under 700&#8197;bar hydrogen, &gt;10 times lower pressure than that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum. DFT calculations and EPR measurements support an unconventional mechanism whereby strong AlH3 binding to bipyridine results in single&#8208;electron transfer to form AlH2(AlH3)n clusters. The resulting size&#8208;dependent charge redistribution alters the dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation thermochemistry, suggesting a novel strategy to enable reversibility in high&#8208;capacity metal hydrides.

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of Agarozizanol&#8197;B via a Strained Photocascade Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a simple indanone derivative, diastereomerically pure intermediate 1 was formed in a photochemical cascade and served as precursor to agarozizanol&#8197;B (2), either as racemate or as single enantiomer after a resolution step.







Abstract
The prezizane&#8208;type sesquiterpene agarozizanol B was synthesized employing a photochemical cascade reaction as the key step. Starting from a readily available 1&#8208;indanone with a tethered olefin, a strained tetracyclic skeleton was assembled which contained all carbon atoms of the sesquiterpene with the correct relative configuration. The conversion into the tricyclic prezizane skeleton was accomplished by a strategic cyclopropane bond cleavage. Prior to the cyclopropane ring opening an adaption of the oxidation state was required, which could be combined with a reductive resolution step. After removal of two functional groups, the natural product was obtained both in racemic form or, if resolved, as the (+)&#8208;enantiomer which was shown to be identical to the natural product.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Generation of Anticancer Phenanthridine Through Bioorthogonal Cyclization in Antitumor Prodrug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antitumor prodrug platform generating a significant variation in the 3D structure in comparison to the free drug was developed. A totally inactive precursor was shown to produce a cytotoxic phenanthridine by bioorthogonal cyclization within a tumor model. The kinetic of cyclization was fast (&lt;10&#8197;ms) inside living cancer spheroids so as to prevent the drug formation outside of the tumor.







Abstract
Pharmacological inactivation of antitumor drugs toward healthy cells is a critical factor in prodrug development. Typically, pharmaceutical chemists graft temporary moieties to existing antitumor drugs to reduce their pharmacological activity. Here, we report a platform able to generate the cytotoxic agent by intramolecular cyclization. Using phenanthridines as cytotoxic model compounds, we designed ring&#8208;opened biaryl precursors that generated the phenanthridines through bioorthogonal irreversible imination. This reaction was triggered by reactive oxygen species, commonly overproduced in cancer cells, able to convert a vinyl boronate ester function into a ketone that subsequently reacted with a pendant aniline. An inactive precursor was shown to engender a cytotoxic phenanthridine against KB cancer cells. Moreover, the kinetic of cyclization of this prodrug was extremely rapid inside living cells of KB cancer spheroids so as to circumvent drug action.

         <title>Detection and imaging of the plant pathogen response by near infrared fluorescent polyphenol sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plants use secondary metabolites such as polyphenols for chemical defense against pathogens and herbivores. Despite their importance in plant pathogen interactions and tolerance to diseases, it remains challenging to detect polyphenols in complex plant tissues. Here, we create molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging that are based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We identified polyethylene glycol&#8208; phospholipids that render (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs sensitive ( K d&#160; = 90 nM) to plant polyphenols (tannins, flavonoids, &#8230;), which red&#8208;shift (up to 20 nm) and quench their emission (~1000 nm). These sensors report changes in total polyphenol level after herbivore or pathogen challenge in crop plant systems (Soybean&#160; Glycine max ) and leaf tissue extracts ( Tococa spp).&#160; We furthermore demonstrate remote chemical imaging of pathogen&#8208;induced polyphenol release from roots of soybean seedlings over the time course of 24h. This approach allows&#160; in situ&#160; visualization and understanding of the chemical plant defense in real time and paves the way for plant phenotyping for optimized polyphenol secretion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nickelacyclobutanes are mostly invoked as reactive intermediates in the reaction of nickel carbenes and olefins to yield cyclopropanes. Nevertheless, early work suggested that other decomposition routes such as &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and even metathesis could be accessible. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of a stable pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane incorporated in a pincer complex. The coordination of different coligands to the nickelacyclobutane determines its selective decomposition along cyclopropanation, metathesis or apparent &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathways. DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism of these different pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: a Green Light Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed Phenylimino Indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch, showing negative photochromism.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed Phenylimino Indolinone (PIO), a green-light addressable T-type photoswitch, showing negative photochromism.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Perfluoroalkylative Carbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes: Access to &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed perfluoroalkylative carbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. More than 100 examples of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl esters were prepared directly from readily available substrates with good functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component carbonylation represents an efficient strategy for the preparation of various functionalized carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a general palladium&#8208;catalyzed perfluoroalkylative carbonylation of unactivated alkenes using inexpensive and readily available carbon monoxide as the C1 source and perfluoroalkyl halides as the coupling partner. A wide range of phenols and alcohols were transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl esters in high yields with broad functional group tolerance and good chemoselectivity. Additionally, alkyl halides can be utilized as alkoxy source as well to give the desired esters. Moreover, several pharmaceutical and bio&#8208;active molecules were also suitable substrates for this one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component carbonylation process to give the targeted products in good yields.

         <title>Stereochemical Control via Chirality Pairing: Stereodivergent Syntheses of Enantioenriched Homoallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic stereodivergent syntheses of enantioenriched homoallylic alcohols using chiral nonracemic &#945;&#8208;CH2Bpin&#8208;substituted E&#8208;crotylboronate via chirality pairing is developed.







Abstract
We report herein the development of stereodivergent syntheses of enantioenriched homoallylic alcohols using chiral nonracemic &#945;&#8208;CH2Bpin&#8208;substituted crotylboronate. Chiral phosphoric acid (S)&#8208;A&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allyl addition with the reagent gave Z&#8208;anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols with excellent enantioselectivities and Z&#8208;selectivities. When the enantiomeric acid catalyst (R)&#8208;A was utilized, the stereoselectivity was completely reversed and E&#8208;anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols were obtained with high E&#8208;selectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. By pairing the chirality of the boron reagent with the catalyst, two complementary stereoisomers of chiral homoallylic alcohols can be obtained selectively from the same boron reagent. DFT computational studies were conducted to probe the origins of the observed stereoselectivity. These reactions generate highly enantioenriched homoallylic alcohol products that are valuable for rapid construction of polyketide structural frameworks.

         <title>The Complex Crystal Structure and Abundant Local Defects of Zeolite EMM&#8208;17 Unraveled by Combined Electron Crystallography and Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex crystal structure of EMM&#8208;17 polymorphs A and B containing a unique 10(12)&#215;10(12)&#215;11&#8208;ring channel system were directly solved using continuous rotation electron diffraction data. Polymorph C and a large number of structural defects were observed at the atomic resolution by integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. EMM&#8208;17 exhibits excellent kinetic separation ability for C6 alkane isomers.







Abstract
In this study, we successfully solve polymorphs A and B of zeolite EMM&#8208;17, which can only crystallize in sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized crystals while containing complex stacking disorders, from the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electron diffraction (ED) data. This is the first time that the atomic structure of this polymorph has been ab initio solved, and the result reveals a unique 10(12)&#215;10(12)&#215;11&#8208;ring channel system. Moreover, we acquire the first atomic&#8208;resolution images of EMM&#8208;17 using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. The images allow us to directly observe polymorphs B and C and discover a large number of local structural defects. Based on structural features unraveled from the reciprocal&#8208;space 3D ED data and real&#8208;space images, we propose a series of energetically feasible local structures in EMM&#8208;17. We also demonstrate that the unique porous structure of EMM&#8208;17 enables efficient kinetic separation of C6 alkane isomers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the first decarboxylative hydroxylation reaction to synthesize phenols from benzoic acids is reported. The method overcomes the challenges associated with conventional decarboxylation of benzoic acids and can be applied even for the late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first decarboxylative hydroxylation to synthesize phenols from benzoic acids at 35&#8201;&#176;C via photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled radical decarboxylative carbometalation. The aromatic decarboxylative hydroxylation is synthetically promising due to its mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and late&#8208;stage applications.

         <title>A Tandem Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of Single&#8208;Atom Cu&#8208;S1N3 Catalysts via Integration with Cu Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem catalyst composed of single Cu sites co&#8208;coordinated with N and S and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux) was developed for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux exhibited a 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for CO formation (FECO), outperforming the single&#8208;atomic Cu&#8208;N4 analogue (FECO=54&#8201;%).







Abstract
We developed a tandem electrocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion comprising the single Cu site co&#8208;coordinated with N and S anchored carbon matrix (Cu&#8208;S1N3) and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cux), denoted as Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;S1N3/Cux composite presents a 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO generation (FECO) at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE and high FECO over 90&#8201;% from &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.75&#8197;V, outperforming the analogues with Cu&#8208;N4 (FECO only 54&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V) and Cu&#8208;S1N3 (FECO 70&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V) configurations. The unsymmetrical Cu&#8208;S1N3 atomic interface in the carbon basal plane possesses an optimized binding energy for the key intermediate *COOH compared with Cu&#8208;N4 site. At the same time, the adjacent Cux effectively promotes the protonation of *CO2&#8722; by accelerating water dissociation and offering *H to the Cu&#8208;S1N3 active sites. This work provides a tandem strategy for facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer over the atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites.

&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited a 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for CO formation (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;), outperforming the single-atomic Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; analogue (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=54&#8201;%).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a tandem electrocatalyst for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion comprising the single Cu site co-coordinated with N and S anchored carbon matrix (Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;), denoted as Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. The as-prepared Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; composite presents a 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO generation (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE and high FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; over 90&#8201;% from &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.75&#8197;V, outperforming the analogues with Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; only 54&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V) and Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; 70&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V) configurations. The unsymmetrical Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; atomic interface in the carbon basal plane possesses an optimized binding energy for the key intermediate *COOH compared with Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site. At the same time, the adjacent Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; effectively promotes the protonation of *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by accelerating water dissociation and offering *H to the Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; active sites. This work provides a tandem strategy for facilitating proton-coupled electron transfer over the atomic-level catalytic sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction Kinetics on Atomically Dispersed Monovalent Zn(I) Sites by Rationally Engineering Proton&#8208;feeding Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for CO2 utilization. Due to the slow proton&#8208;feeding rates from sluggish water dissociation kinetics, however, the CO2RR process involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer is greatly limited by poor selectivity and low yield. Herein, we develop an atomically dispersed monovalent zinc anchored on nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (Zn/NC NSs) as an efficient catalyst for CO2RR. Benefiting from the unique coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the optimized Zn/NC NSs exhibits a superior CO2RR performance, featured by a high current density up to 50 mA cm&#8208;2 with an outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency of &#65374;95%. The center Zn(I) atom coordinated with three N atoms and one N atom that bridge over two adjacent graphitic edge (Zn&#8208;N3+1) is identified as the catalytically active site by thorough structural characterizations. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared absorption spectroscopy results reveal that the twisted Zn&#8208;N3+1 structure accelerates the CO2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *CO2 to *COOH on the rationally engineered proton&#8208;feeding centers, while theoretical calculations elucidate that atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N3+1 moieties decrease the potential barriers for the intermediate COOH* formation, promoting the proton&#8208;coupled CO2RR kinetics and boosting the overall catalytic performance. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 battery based on the Zn/NC NS cathode delivers a maximal power density of 1.8 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Assembled Film from Semiconductor Nanorods with Ultra&#8208;strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical nanomaterials have generated significant levels of interest for generating strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. We used the Langmuir&#8208;Schaeffer technique to generate the continuous and compact assembly of CdSe/CdS chiral film. We assembled achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers. This allowed us to tailor chiroptical properties to achieve high CPL signals. The chiral film was symmetrical and had the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and CPL signals with ten layers (RH (right&#8208;handed)&#8208;/LH (left&#8208;handed)&#8208;5 + 5 layers) and a 45&#176; inter&#8208;angle. Specifically, RH&#8208;5+5 of the chiral film exhibited 1431 mdeg of CD activity and strong CPL signals with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.0997. The helical stacked crystal plates with linear birefringence resulted in strong circular birefringence, as determined by the Reusch model. Electromagnetic simulations indicated that such remarkable optical activity was attributed to the birefringence and dichroism of the well&#8208;aligned CdSe/CdS nanorod layers in the chiral films. Under right/left circular polarized (RCP/LCP) light excitation, the well aligned semiconductor nanorods exhibited differences in the coupling ef&#64257;ciencies to RCP and LCP light. Our CdSe/CdS chiral films, which exhibit ultra&#8208;strong CPL activity, will provide a novel strategy for the fabrication of chiroptical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues,  phomYc  ,  phomYd  , and  phomYe  , are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged, and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Targetable conformationally restricted cyanines enable photon&#8208;count limited applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanine dyes are exceptionally useful probes for a range of fluorescence&#8208;based applications, but their photon output can be limited by  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  photoisomerization. We recently demonstrated that appending a ring system to the pentamethine cyanine ring system improves the quantum yield and extends the fluorescence lifetime. Here, we report an optimized synthesis of persulfonated variants that enable efficient labeling of nucleic acids and proteins. We demonstrate that a bifunctional sulfonated tertiary amide significantly improves the optical properties of the resulting bioconjugates. These new conformationally restricted cyanines are compared to the parent cyanine derivatives in a range of contexts. These include their use in the plasmonic hotspot of a DNA&#8208;nanoantenna, in single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications, far&#8208;red fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). These efforts define contexts in which eliminating cyanine isomerization provides meaningful benefits to imaging performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Functionalization with d0 Early Transition Metals Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The undesirable loss of methane (CH4) at remote locations welcomes approaches that ambiently functionalize CH4 on&#8208;site without intense infrastructure investment. Recently, we found that electrochemical oxidation of vanadium(V)&#8208;oxo with bisulfate ligand leads to CH4 activation at ambient conditions. The key question is whether such an observation is a one&#8208;off coincidence or a general strategy for electrocatalyst design. Here, a general scheme of electrocatalytic CH4 activation with d0 early transition metals is established. The pre&#8208;catalysts&#8217; molecular structure, electrocatalytic kinetics, and mechanism were detailed for titanium (IV), vanadium (V), and chromium (VI) species as model systems. After a turnover&#8208;limiting one&#8208;electron electrochemical oxidation, the yielded ligand&#8208;centered cation radicals activate CH4 with low activation energy and high selectivity. The reactivities are universal among early transition metals from Period 4 to 6, and the reactivities trend for different early transition metals correlate with their d orbital energies across periodic table. Our results offer new chemical insights towards developing advanced ambient electrocatalysts of natural gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Ordered Inverse Opal Structures Synthesized from Shape&#8208;Controlled Nanocrystal Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack&#8208;free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO  2  ) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc&#8208;doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO  2  IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO  2  nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack&#8208;free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Ratio&#8208;Dependent Chemodivergent Asymmetric Synthesis</title>

A chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis can be achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system.







Abstract
Chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis was achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system. Using N&#8208;(aroyloxy)phthalimide as the precursor of either an oxygen&#8208;centered aroyloxy radical or a nitrogen&#8208;centered phthalimidyl radical, enantioselective oxocyanation or aminocyanation of alkenes was achieved separately through a dual photoredox and copper catalysis. The metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio can exert chemoselective control while retaining the high enantiopurity of divergent products. Both reactions proceed efficiently with catalyst loading as low as 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% and can be performed on a gram scale without loss of chemoselectivity or enantioselectivity. Chemodivergent asymmetric 1,5&#8208;aminocyanation or 1,5&#8208;oxocyanation of vinylcyclopropane can also be realized by this protocol. Mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed to shed light on the stereochemical and chemodivergent results.

         <title>Automated Electrical Quantification of Vitamin&#8197;B1 in a Bodily Fluid using an Engineered Nanopore Sensor</title>

         <dc:description>
Quantification of small molecules in biological samples is challenging. Using the concentration&#8208;dependent current fluctuations elicited by a thiamine binding protein inside a ClyA nanopore, we show the automated quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute. By swapping the internal biosensor, this principle can be applied for the development of multiple next&#8208;generation home&#8208;diagnostic small&#8208;molecule sensors.







Abstract
The ability to measure the concentration of metabolites in biological samples is important, both in the clinic and for home diagnostics. Here we present a nanopore&#8208;based biosensor and automated data analysis for quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute, without the need for recalibration. For this we use the Cytolysin A nanopore and equip it with an engineered periplasmic thiamine binding protein (TbpA). To allow fast measurements we tuned the affinity of TbpA for thiamine by redesigning the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the thiazole group of thiamine and TbpA. This substitution resulted furthermore in a marked difference between unbound and bound state, allowing the reliable discrimination of thiamine from its two phosphorylated forms by residual current only. Using an array of nanopores, this will allow the quantification within seconds, paving the way for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule metabolite detection systems.

         <title>Reclaiming Inactive Lithium with a Triiodide/Iodide Redox Couple for Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22990-22995, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) redox couple is introduced with a SnI4 initiator to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I3&#8722; converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, and the oxidation of LiI by a delithiated cathode realizes the restoration of Li ion in cathode from inactive Li. The regenerated I3&#8722; by oxidation engages the further redox reactions.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries suffer from a short lifespan owing to apparently ceaseless inactive Li accumulation, which is accompanied by the consumption of electrolyte and active Li reservoir, seriously deteriorating the cyclability of batteries. Herein, a triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) redox couple initiated by stannic iodide (SnI4) is demonstrated to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I3&#8722; converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, which then diffuses to the cathode side. The oxidation of LiI by the delithiated cathode transforms cathode into the lithiation state and regenerates I3&#8722;, reclaiming Li ion from inactive Li. The regenerated I3&#8722; engages the further redox reactions. Furthermore, the formation of Sn mitigates the corrosion of I3&#8722; on active Li reservoir sacrificially. In working Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries, the accumulated inactive Li is significantly reclaimed by the reversible I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox couple, improving the lifespan of batteries by twice. This work initiates a creative solution to reclaim inactive Li for prolonging the lifespan of practical Li metal batteries.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together. A built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is thus formed, which triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved.







Abstract
A built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO3&#8722; ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO3RR). A model electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed . This built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also raises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower the energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved, which are all the best among studies reported at 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of nitrate concentration to date.

         <title>The Voltage Dependent Sidedness of the Reprotonation of the Retinal Schiff Base Determines the Unique Inward Pumping of Xenorhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 23010-23017, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique behaviour of inward proton pumping xenorhodopsins (XeR) makes these microbial rhodopsins an alternative optogenetic tool to the passively transporting light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. channelrhodopsin&#8208;1 and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. Here, we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).







Abstract
The new class of microbial rhodopsins, called xenorhodopsins (XeRs),[1] extends the versatility of this family by inward H+ pumps.[2&#8211;4] These pumps are an alternative optogenetic tool to the light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. ChR1,2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. In this work we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).[1] The photodynamic behavior of NsXeR was investigated on the ps to s time scale elucidating the formation of the J and K and a previously unknown long&#8208;lived intermediate. The pH dependent kinetics reveal that alkalization of the surrounding medium accelerates the photocycle and the pump turnover. In patch&#8208;clamp experiments the blue&#8208;light illumination of NsXeR in the M state shows a potential&#8208;dependent vectoriality of the photocurrent transients, suggesting a variable accessibility of reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base. Insights on the kinetically independent switching mechanism could furthermore be obtained by mutational studies on the putative intracellular H+ acceptor D220.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Over Bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22761-22768, October 11, 2021. </description>

A Rhn cluster cocatalyst with Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 delivers a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity, which benefits from a bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction mechanism, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites aided by hydrogen atom transfer to adjacent Rh0 sites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting provides an economically feasible way for converting solar energy into hydrogen. Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remain a challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Herein, we design a Rhn cluster cocatalyst, with Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The turnover frequency (TOF) achieves 416.73&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only with Rh3+ species. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption characterization shows the OER process on the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites. The DFT calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Functionalized Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a fluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) was developed to suppress Li dendrite growth by realizing both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number. Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone reduce the mobility of Li salt anion and decrease the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains.







Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li) is regarded as the ideal anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low electrochemical potential, highest theoretical energy density and low density. There are, however, still significant challenges to be addressed such as Li&#8208;dendrite growth and low interfacial stability, which impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. In order to circumvent these shortcomings, herein, we present a gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a perfluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) to achieve both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number by fundamentally altering the solubility of salt within the gel electrolyte through Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone. Moreover, the presence of F&#8208;IL moieties decreased the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains, enabling a rapid transfer of Li cation within the gel network. These structural features enabled the immobilization of anions on the ionic liquid segments to alleviate the space&#8208;charge effect while promoting stronger anion coordination and weaker cation coordination in the Lewis&#8208;acidic polymers. Accordingly, we realized a high Li ion conductivity (9.16&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high Li ion transference number of 0.69 simultaneously, along with a good electrochemical stability up to 4.55&#8197;V, while effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte exhibited stable cycling performance of the Li|Li symmetric cell of 9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 1800&#8197;hours and retained 86.7&#8201;% of the original capacity after 250&#8197;cycles for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) full cell.

Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte exhibited stable cycling performance of the Li|Li symmetric cell of 9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for more than 1800&#8197;hours and retained 86.7&#8201;% of the original capacity after 250&#8197;cycles for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) full cell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)lithium cation, the lightest main&#8208;group metal analogue of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)Cr, was prepared and characterized in the solid state.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)lithium cation, the benzene metallocene of the lightest metal, is reported. The boron compound FmesBCl2 [Fmes: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] reacted with three molar equivalents of the lithio&#8208;acetylene reagent Li&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Fmxyl [Fmxyl: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]. Subsequent crystallization from benzene gave the [bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)Li]+ cation with the [{FmesB(&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Fmxyl)3}2Li]&#8722; anion. This parent [(arene)2Li]+ cation shows an eclipsed arrangement of the pair of benzene ligands at the central lithium cation with uniform carbon&#8208;lithium bond lengths. The corresponding [(&#951;6&#8208;toluene)2Li]+ and [(&#951;6&#8208;durene)2Li]+ containing salts were similarly prepared. The bis(arene)lithium cations were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by solid&#8208;state 7Li MAS NMR spectroscopy and their bonding features were analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Basic EDTA as a Highly Active Molecular Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 23002-23009, October 11, 2021. </description>

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotubes has been identified as active catalyst for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4. A high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6&#8201;% for CH4 production is observed.







Abstract
The most active catalysts so far successful in hydrogenation reduction of CO2 are mainly heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The complex coordination environments and multiple active sites in heterogeneous catalysts result in low selectivity of target product, while molecular catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites and tailorable structures allow mechanism&#8208;based performance optimization. Herein, we firstly report a single ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) molecular&#8208;level immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotube as a catalyst for transferring CO2 to CH4 with an excellent performance. This catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6&#8201;% toward CH4, a partial current density of &#8722;16.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a potential of &#8722;1.3&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Lewis basic COO&#8722; groups in EDTA molecule are the active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The energy barrier for the generation of CO from *CO intermediate is as high as 0.52&#8197;eV, while the further protonation of *CO to *CHO follows an energetic downhill path (&#8722;1.57&#8197;eV), resulting in the high selectivity of CH4. This work makes it possible to control the product selectivity for CO2RR according to the relationship between the energy barrier of *CO intermediate and molecular structures in the future.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Strain Mapping of High&#8208;Index Facets in Late&#8208;Transition&#8208;Metal Nanoparticles for Electrocatalysis</title>

Mapping of the atomic strain on high&#8208;index facet transition&#8208;metal nanoparticles is conducted to investigate the underlying correlation between the enhanced surface reactivity and the structural properties. Essential parameters are proposed to describe the surface features and predict the surface reactivity, examined by adsorption energy calculations of CO2RR key intermediates.







Abstract
Although high&#8208;index facets (HIF) endows excellent catalytic activity through undercoordinated sites with strain effect, current characterizations techniques still cannot unravel the detailed strain distributions to understand the origins of electroactivity. Nevertheless, theoretical principles to quantify the structural features and their effects on catalytic activity improvements on HIFs are still lacking, which renders the experimental efforts laborious. In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late&#8208;transition metal HIF nanoparticle models. The surface reactivities of the nanoparticles have been examined by adsorption energy calculations and their correlations with structural features are observed. Our proposed theoretical principles on surface characterizations of high&#8208;index facets nanomaterials will promote the design and synthesis of efficient transition metal based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Practical Chemoselective Acylation: Organocatalytic Chemodivergent Esterification and Amidation of Amino Alcohols with N&#8208;Carbonylimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22818-22825, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemoselective esterification or aniline amidation of polyfunctional molecules is possible by a catalytic chemodivergent protocol involving only simple reagents: N&#8208;acylimidazoles and either DBU or pyridinium ion (see scheme). These reactions may be performed in the simultaneous presence of phenols, indoles, amides, some aliphatic amines, and other groups. A mechanism&#8208;based model for predicting the acylation chemoselectivity is provided.







Abstract
Chemoselective transformations are a cornerstone of efficient organic synthesis; however, achieving this goal for even simple transformations, such as acylation reactions, is often a challenge. We report that N&#8208;carbonylimidazoles enable catalytic chemodivergent aniline or alcohol acylation in the presence of pyridinium ions or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU), respectively. Both acylation reactions display high and broad chemoselectivity for the target group. Unprecedented levels of chemoselectivity were observed in the DBU&#8208;catalyzed esterification: A single esterification product was obtained from a molecule containing primary aniline, alcohol, phenol, secondary amide, and N&#8722;H indole groups. These acylation reactions are highly practical as they involve only readily available, inexpensive, and relatively safe reagents; can be performed on a multigram scale; and can be used on carboxylic acids directly by in situ formation of the acylimidazole electrophile.

         <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of a Reactive [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2]2+ Intermediate in Cu/TEMPO Catalyzed Aerobic Alcohol Oxidation Reaction</title>

A dinuclear CuI complex 1 activates O2 to form a bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species, which can efficiently couple O2 reduction and the oxidation of alcohols to make 1/TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) a suitable catalyst system for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. Notably, 1/TEMPO ensures a clean reduction of O2 to H2O, in contrast to (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)CuI/TEMPO, where the generation of H2O2 is proposed.







Abstract
CuI/TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) catalyst systems are versatile catalysts for aerobic alcohol oxidation reactions to selectively yield aldehydes. However, several aspects of the mechanism are yet unresolved, mainly because of the lack of identification of any reactive intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a dinuclear [L12Cu2]2+ complex 1, which in presence of TEMPO can couple the catalytic 4&#8201;H+/4&#8201;e&#8722; reduction of O2 to water to the oxidation of benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The mechanisms of the O2&#8208;reduction and alcohol oxidation reactions have been clarified by the spectroscopic detection of the reactive intermediates in the gas and condensed phases, as well as by kinetic studies on each step in the catalytic cycles. Bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo)dicopper(III) (2) and bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species 3 are shown as viable reactants in oxidation catalysis. The present study provides deep mechanistic insight into the aerobic oxidation of alcohols that should serve as a valuable foundation for ongoing efforts dedicated towards the understanding of transition&#8208;metal catalysts involving redox&#8208;active organic cocatalysts.

         <title>Phosphorized CoNi2S4 Yolk&#8208;Shell Spheres for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Production via Water and Urea Electrolysis</title>

Phosphorus&#8208;substituted CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) have been rationally designed and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation and subsequent gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. The desired hollow structure and multielement composition with abundant Ni3+ active sites endow P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs with high electrocatalytic activity and robust stability towards electrochemical hydrogen production via water splitting and urea electrolysis.







Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Porous phosphorized CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) were rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni3+/Ni2+ couple, enhanced electronic conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8722;0.135&#8197;V, 1.512&#8197;V, and 1.306&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544&#8197;V in water splitting and 1.402&#8197;V in urea electrolysis to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent durability for 100&#8197;h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production and provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.

         <title>Platinum Modulates Redox Properties and 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>

Pt is proven to be an effective accelerator to Ni(OH)2 for catalyzing HMF oxidation reaction. Pt optimizes the surface electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 and accelerates the formation of the active Ni(OH)O species. Besides, it optimizes the adsorption mode of HMF and reduces the adsorption energy.







Abstract
Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)2 is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)2 electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)2 electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)2 and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)2. The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel&#8208;based catalyst for HMF electro&#8208;oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni&#8208;based catalysts such as Ni(HCO3)2 and NiO.

         <title>Luminescent Behavior Elucidation of a Disilane&#8208;Bridged D&#8211;A&#8211;D Triad Composed of Phenothiazine and Thienopyrazine</title>

Abstract
A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8722;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8722;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.

A nitrogen&#8208;anchored low&#8208;valence Zn single&#8208;atom catalyst, containing coordinately unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 active sites, can boost electrochemical CO2 reduction to industrial application levels.







Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;atom catalyst containing low&#8208;valence zinc atoms (Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC) is reported. It contains saturated four&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N4) and unsaturated three&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N3) sites. The latter makes Zn a low&#8208;valence state, as deduced from X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and density functional theory. Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC catalyzes electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with near&#8208;unity selectivity in water at an overpotential as low as 310&#8197;mV. A current density up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved together with high CO selectivity of &gt;95&#8201;% using Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC in a flow cell. Calculations suggest that the unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 could dramatically reduce the energy barrier by stabilizing the COOH* intermediate owing to the electron&#8208;rich environment of Zn. This work sheds light on the relationship among coordination number, valence state, and catalytic performance and achieves high current densities relevant for industrial applications.

         <title>Nucleophilic and Radical Heptafluoroisopropoxylation with Redox&#8208;Active Reagents</title>

Redox&#8208;active heptafluoroisopropoxylating reagents were conveniently prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines, and then were successfully used for the synthesis of a series of alkyl(aryl) heptafluoroisopropyl ethers.







Abstract
The heptafluoroisopropyl group (CF(CF3)2) is prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. However, heptafluoroisopropoxylated (OCF(CF3)2) compounds remain largely underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient access to these compounds. Herein, we disclose the practical and efficient heptafluoroisopropoxylation reactions through the invention of a series of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. These reagents were readily prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines with AgCF(CF3)2. The substitutions on the nitrogen atom significantly affected the properties and reactivities of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. Accordingly, two types of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents including N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 phthalimide A and N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 benzotriazolium salt O&#8242; were used as OCF(CF3)2 anion and radical precursors, respectively. This protocol enables the direct heptafluoroisopropoxylation of a range of substrates, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to excellent yields.

Experimental evidence for the azide&#8208;oxygen noncovalent interaction in dictating the conformation of molecules having these functional groups in vicinity is provided. 36 Crystal structures of designed compounds were analyzed. Additionally, a CSD search revealed the frequent occurrence of this interaction in reported crystal structures. This interaction might find use in designing supramolecular architectures and in crystal engineering.







Abstract
We have designed, synthesized, and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#946; contact. Geometry&#8208;optimized structures [using M06&#8208;2X/6&#8211;311G(d,p) level of theory] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this is not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader's Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI&#8208;RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems. NBO analysis suggested a weak orbital&#8208;relaxation (charge&#8208;transfer) contribution of energy for a few (sp2)O&#8208;donor systems. Natural population analysis (NPA) and molecular electrostatic potential mapping (MESP) of these crystal structures further revealed the existence of favorable azide&#8208;oxygen interaction. A CSD search indicated the frequent and consistent occurrence of this interaction and its role dictating the syn conformation of azide and oxygen in molecules where these groups are separated by 2&#8211;4 bonds.

Cu2SnS3 evolved into the strongly coupled heterogeneous interfaces of SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O under reaction conditions. This strongly coupled heterojunction as real active sites drives the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thus promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Thus, Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
Bimetallic sulfides are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate over a wide potential window, however, they will undergo in situ structural evolution under the reaction conditions. Therefore, clarifying the structural evolution process, the real active site and the catalytic mechanism is significant. Here, taking Cu2SnS3 as an example, we unveiled that Cu2SnS3 occurred self&#8208;adapted phase separation toward forming the stable SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O heterojunction during the electrochemical process. Calculations illustrated that the strongly coupled interfaces as real active sites driven the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thereby promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of ternary sulfides under the CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Various Stacking Patterns of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Cocrystals: Insight into Competitive Intermolecular Interactions and Control of Stacking Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22839-22848, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of the stacking patterns of molecular two&#8208;dimensional layers in a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystals by a chemical modification is demonstrated. The effect of the chemical modification is discussed in terms of both the enthalpic and entropic contributions based on experimental and computational results.







Abstract
Control over the stacking patterns in 2D molecular assemblies is demonstrated using chemical modification. A target system is a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystal (2:1) composed of 2&#8208;pyrrolidone (Py) and chloranilic acid (CA) (PyCA). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that weak intersheet interactions give rise to a variety of metastable overlapping patterns comprised of the 2D assemblies mainly formed via hydrogen bonds, affording reversible and irreversible structural phase transitions. We prepared cocrystals of Py and anilic acids bearing different halogens, in which 2D assemblies isostructural with those observed in PyCA exhibit various overlapping patterns. The order of stability for each overlapping pattern estimated using calculations of the intermolecular interactions did not completely coincide with those indicated by our experimental results, which can be explained by considering the entropic effect: the molecular motion of Py as detected using nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy.

Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles while retaining the integrity and biological functions of RNA was reported. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000 nucleotides can be used.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;directed biomolecule crosslinking in nature has been used for synthesizing various biopolymers, including DNA, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. However, the RNA biopolymer has been avoided so far, as due to the poor stability of the RNA molecules, the formation of a biopolymer may alter the biological function of the molecules. Herein, for the first time, we report Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles while retaining the integrity and biological function of RNA. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000 nucleotides were used, highlighting the versatility of this approach. The assembled nanospheres possess a superior RNA&#8208;loading efficiency, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability. In&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo evaluation demonstrated mRNA delivery for expressing GFP proteins, and microRNA delivery to triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. This coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly behavior amplifies the horizons of RNA coordination chemistry and the application scope of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Dithiane/Iodofluorobenzene Mixtures: A New Class of Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22983-22989, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), the first halogen bonding&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent is reported. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic point of 13.7&#8201;&#176;C, over a wide compositional range. The other combinations of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
While research into deep eutectic solvents (DESs) has expanded over the previous two decades, the focus has remained on the utilization of hydrogen bond donors in these systems. Additionally, the majority of the known DESs rely on at least one ionic component. Through the combination of 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), we report the first known DES based on halogen bonding. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic melting temperature of 13.7&#8201;&#176;C over a range of 1,3&#8208;dithiane mole fraction (0.35 to 0.75). Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85&lt;RXB&lt;0.99; RXB=normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.

         <title>Observability of Paramagnetic NMR Signals at over 10&#8201;000 ppm Chemical Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22856-22864, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution paramagnetic NMR resonances of a ferrous complex with an intermediate spin ground state with chemical shifts beyond ten thousand ppm were detected, the observability of which are attributed to a large rhombic zero&#8208;field splitting resulting in an effective suppression of the dipolar relaxation mechanism.







Abstract
We report an experimental observation of 31P&#8197;NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000&#8197;ppm (meaning percent range, and a new record for solutions), and similar 1H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [tBu(PNP)Fe&#8208;H], where PNP is a carbazole&#8208;based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (T1 &#8776;10&#8722;11&#8197;s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.

         <title>An Improved Turn Structure for Inducing &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Formation in Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22776-22782, October 11, 2021. </description>

&#948;&#8208;Linked &#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (&#948;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides.







Abstract
Although &#946;&#8208;hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is no tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that &#948;&#8208;linked &#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (&#948;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides. We developed a synthesis of protected &#948;MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with l&#8208;leucine and affords gram quantities of the N&#945;&#8208;Boc&#8208;N&#948;&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;&#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine building block. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms that the &#948;MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopy allow comparison of the &#948;MeOrn turn template to the &#948;&#8208;linked ornithine (&#948;Orn) turn template that we previously introduced and to the popular d&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly turn template. These studies show that the folding of the &#948;MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of &#948;Orn and is comparable to d&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly.

&lt;p&gt;&#948;-Linked &#947;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-methyl-ornithine (&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;-turn template for inducing a &#946;-hairpin conformation in peptides.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &#946;-hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is no tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a &#946;-hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that &#948;-linked &#947;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-methyl-ornithine (&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;-turn template for inducing a &#946;-hairpin conformation in peptides. We developed a synthesis of protected &lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-leucine and affords gram quantities of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#945;&lt;/sup&gt;-Boc-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;-Fmoc-&#947;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-methyl-ornithine building block. X-ray crystallography confirms that the &lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic &#946;-hairpin peptide.

         <title>Surface Density Dependent Catalytic Activity of Single Palladium Atoms Supported on Ceria**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on CeO2 deviate from the assumption of constant specific activity as a function of Pd loading. CO oxidation activity increases as more Pd is loaded, but once nanoparticles form, dramatic deactivation is observed. Pd supported on Al2O3 does not exhibit this phenomenon, demonstrating that the reducibility of the support is an important factor.







Abstract
The analogy between single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and molecular catalysts predicts that the specific catalytic activity of these systems is constant. We provide evidence that this prediction is not necessarily true. As a case in point, we show that the specific activity over ceria&#8208;supported single Pd atoms linearly increases with metal atom density, originating from the cumulative enhancement of CeO2 reducibility. The long&#8208;range electrostatic footprints (&#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) around each Pd site overlap with each other as surface Pd density increases, resulting in an observed deviation from constant specific activity. These cooperative effects exhaust previously active O atoms above a certain Pd density, leading to their permanent removal and a consequent drop in reaction rate. The findings of our combined experimental and computational study show that the specific catalytic activity of reducible oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts can be tuned by varying the surface density of single metal atoms.

         <title>Versatile 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Reference Electrodes for Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Solutions</title>

The lack of stable reference electrodes (REs) for electrochemical measurements in small cell arrangements is an often&#8208;neglected problem. Herein we present an easily applicable procedure for the assembly of stable and cheap micro&#8208;REs, which are highly adaptable due to 3D&#8208;printed housings; 3 aqueous and 3 non&#8208;aqueous micro&#8208;REs based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na. After fabrication, their stability and leak&#8208;tightness are shown by electrochemical measurements.







Abstract
While numerous reference electrodes suitable for aqueous electrolytes exist, there is no well&#8208;defined standard for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, reference electrodes are often large and do not meet the size requirements for small cells. In this work, we present a simple method for fabricating stable 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;reference electrodes. The prints are made from polyvinylidene fluoride, which is chemically inert in strong acids, bases, and commonly used non&#8208;aqueous solvents. We chose six different reference systems based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na, including three aqueous and three non&#8208;aqueous systems to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. Subsequently, we conducted cyclic voltammetry experiments and measured the potential difference between the aqueous homemade reference electrodes and a commercial Ag/AgCl&#8208;electrode. For the non&#8208;aqueous reference electrodes, we chose the ferrocene redox couple as an internal standard. From these measurements, we deduced that this new class of micro&#8208;reference electrodes is leak&#8208;tight and shows a stable electrode potential.

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Triphase Photocatalysis Over a Multifunctional Bilayer Paper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22963-22969, October 11, 2021. </description>

A scalable TiO2/C bilayer paper for photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic phenol oxidation is reported. The triphase interface ensures the fast supply of oxygen reactant at high photon flux, whilst the photothermal effect promotes the subsequent phenol free radical reaction kinetics. Cycling stability, sunlight feasibility, oxygen concentration compatibility and flow condition demonstrate the possibility for large&#8208;scale photocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Photocatalysis as one of the future environment technologies has been investigated for decades. Despite great efforts in catalyst engineering, the widely used powder dispersion and photoelectrode systems are still restricted by sluggish interfacial mass transfer and chemical processes. Here we develop a scalable bilayer paper from commercialized TiO2 and carbon nanomaterials, self&#8208;supported at gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid interfaces for photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species can be facilitated through fast oxygen diffusion over triphase interfaces, while the interfacial photothermal effect promotes the following free radical reaction for advanced oxidation of phenol. Under full spectrum irradiation, the triphase system shows 13 times higher reaction rate than diphase controlled system, achieving 88.4&#8201;% mineralization of high concentration phenol within 90&#8197;min full spectrum irradiation. The bilayer paper also exhibits high stability over 40 times cycling experiments and sunlight driven feasibility, showing potentials for large scale photocatalytic applications by being further integrated into a triphase flow reactor.

From petroleum refining to thermoplastic elastomers and flame retardants: We report on a new synthetic method to prepare segmented polyurethanes and thermoplastic elastomers from elemental sulfur which have improved thermomechanical properties and flame retardancy.







Abstract
The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high&#8208;performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi&#8208;block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S8 with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods, a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and microscopic imaging. These sulfur&#8208;based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8211;24&#8197;MPa) and ductility (348&#8201;% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578&#8201;% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Arylbenzylation of Alkenylarenes: Kinetic Studies Reveal Autocatalysis by ZnX2**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22977-22982, October 11, 2021. </description>

We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylbenzylation reaction of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents to furnish 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures, the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. Kinetic studies and competition experiments reveal that the reaction is autocatalyzed by ZnX2 by activating benzyl halides, potentially by a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction with the halide, which increases the catalytic rate by a factor of three.







Abstract
We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective arylbenzylation of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents. The reaction furnishes differently substituted 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures that are reminiscent of the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds with a rate&#8208;limiting single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process and is autocatalyzed by in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated ZnX2. The reaction rate is amplified by a factor of three through autocatalysis upon addition of ZnX2.

         <title>A New Dioxazolone for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Aminoalcohols via Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22948-22955, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and bench&#8208;stable dioxazolone reagent was developed for the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in tertiary and secondary alcohol&#8208;based substrates. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary and secondary C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Vicinal aminoalcohols are widespread structural motifs in bioactive molecules. We report the development of a new dioxazolone reagent containing a p&#8208;nitrophenyldifluoromethyl group, which 1. displays a good safety profile; 2. shows a remarkably high reactivity in the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds; 3. leads to amide products which can be hydrolyzed under mild conditions. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary C&#8722;H bonds of tertiary and secondary alcohols, as well as secondary C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic secondary alcohols. This method provides an easy access to free 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols after efficient and mild cleavage of the oxime directing group and activated amide.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Synthetic Growth Factor Surrogates with Fine&#8208;Tuned Agonism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22745-22752, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists that elicit a desired signal activity is reported. Synthetic growth factor surrogates showing fine&#8208;tuned agonism were developed by exploiting the programmability of DNA aptamer. These DNA&#8208;based agonists can be used to regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting moderate receptor signaling.







Abstract
Designing synthetic surrogates of functional proteins is an important, albeit challenging, task in the field of chemistry. A strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists for growth factor or cytokine receptors that elicit a desired signal activity has been in high demand, as such ligands hold great promise as safer and more effective therapeutics. In the present study, we used a DNA aptamer as a building block and described the strategy&#8208;guided design of a synthetic receptor agonist with fine&#8208;tuned agonism. The developed synthetic partial agonist can regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting fine&#8208;tuned receptor signaling.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Nonenzymatic Template&#8208;Directed RNA Synthesis</title>

We combine X&#8208;ray crystallography and kinetic measurements of modified nucleic acid constructs to determine the requirements for efficient template copying. The 3E conformation of the furanose rings is preferred in the formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Our findings may explain why RNA is a privileged substrate amongst other plausible candidates.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a 3E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.

         <title>Towards Data&#8208;Driven Design of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins: Database and Hierarchical Learning</title>

A standardized database including over 12000 literature transformations was created to provide the data basis for the AI design of asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins. The developed hierarchical learning strategy can provide a predictive model in the early stage of catalysis screening where limited data is available.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most powerful asymmetric transformations in molecular synthesis. Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data&#8208;driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few&#8208;shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening.

         <title>Stabilizing the Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase with Polyacrylamide for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Polyacrylamide (PAM) was introduced to &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI) to realize the formation of an effective solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) in LiMn2O4&#8741;L&#8208;TiO2 full cells by lowering the cathodic limit in the electrochemical stability window (ESW) and suppressing the hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The introduction of &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (WiSE) concept opens a new horizon to aqueous electrochemistry that is benefited from the formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, such SEI still faces multiple challenges, including dissolution, mechanical damaging, and incessant reforming, which result in poor cycling stability. Here, we report a polymeric additive, polyacrylamide (PAM) that effectively stabilizes the interphase in WiSE. With the addition of 5 molar % PAM to 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI electrolyte, a LiMn2O4&#8741;L&#8208;TiO2 full cell exhibits enhanced cycling stability with 86&#8201;% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C. The formation mechanism and evolution of PAM&#8208;assisted SEI was investigated using operando small angle neutron scattering and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal that PAM minimizes the presence of free water molecules at the anode/electrolyte interface, accelerates the TFSI&#8722; anion decomposition, and densifies the SEI.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Catalytic Deracemization of Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22833-22838, October 11, 2021. </description>

Deracemization is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but it is challenging owing to thermodynamic and kinetic barriers. Here we describe a method for deracemization of alcohols based on tandem photochemical dehydrogenation and thermal enantioselective hydrogenation, using light as the only driving force.







Abstract
Deracemization of racemic chiral compounds is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but its development has been hindered by energetic and kinetic challenges. Here we describe a catalytic deracemization method for secondary benzylic alcohols which are important synthetic intermediates and end products for many industries. Driven by visible light only, this method is based on sequential photochemical dehydrogenation followed by enantioselective thermal hydrogenation. The combination of a heterogeneous dehydrogenation photocatalyst and a chiral molecular hydrogenation catalyst is essential to ensure two distinct pathways for the forward and reverse reactions. These reactions convert a large number of racemic aryl alkyl alcohols into their enantiomerically enriched forms in good yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Interpenetration Symmetry Control Within Ultramicroporous Robust Boron Cluster Hybrid MOFs for Benchmark Purification of Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22865-22870, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented symmetrically interpenetrated boron cluster pillared MOF was prepared to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation with large C2H2 capacity (76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 selectivity (56.6), modestly high adsorption heat (54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and high practical C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;% purity) productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) owing to the precise control of interpenetration symmetry.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade&#8208;off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. We report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU&#8208;1, for benchmark selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 with a high C2H2 capacity of 76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and record C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 56.6 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modeling indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C2H2 trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of 99.5&#8201;% purity C2H2 during stepped desorption process.

An alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction is one of the most powerful methods for allylic oxidation of alkenes. However, the inherent radical mechanism and use of peroxides as both oxidants and oxygen nucleophiles render dearth of universal catalytic systems for highly enantioselective variants and limited scope. Herein, an alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Detailed mechanistic studies provide evidences for the radical&#8208;based reaction pathway.

O&#8208;PTIR spectroscopy applied to the analysis of the organic composition of samples from historical paintings is presented for the first time.







Abstract
Optical&#8208;photothermal infrared (O&#8208;PTIR) spectroscopy is a recently developed technique that provides spectra comparable to traditional transmission FTIR spectroscopy with nanometric spatial resolution. Hence, O&#8208;PTIR is a promising candidate for the analysis of historical paintings, as well as other cultural heritage objects, but its potential has not yet been evaluated. This work presents the first application of O&#8208;PTIR to the analysis of cultural heritage, and in particular to an extremely small fragment from Van Gogh's painting L&#8242;Arl&#233;sienne (portrait of Madame Ginoux). The striking results obtained, including the detection of geranium lake pigments as well as the complete analysis of the stratigraphy, failed with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, highlight the potential of this method. The integration of O&#8208;PTIR to the study of cultural heritage opens to the possibility of decreasing the amount of sample extracted, therefore contributing to the preservation of the integrity of artworks while providing a complete characterization of the materials.

N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A)&#8208;modified RNA analysis is limited at the bulk&#8208;population level, thus not giving access to spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Over Bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ Sites (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 23027-23027, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites anchored on Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 show a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity, as reported by Peng&#8197;Fei Liu, Zheng Jiang, Hua&#8197;Gui Yang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#160;22761. Operando XAFS results and DFT calculations illustrate the bifunctional OER mechanism on the Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites: the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites, facilitating a hydrogen atom transfer to the adjacent Rh0 sites, which synergistically optimizes the OER energetics.

Operando XAFS results and DFT calculations illustrate the bifunctional OER mechanism on the Rh&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Rh&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites: the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, facilitating a hydrogen atom transfer to the adjacent Rh&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; sites, which synergistically optimizes the OER energetics.

         <title>Dinuclear Silver Complexes in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22614-22622, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of silver catalysis has seen tremendous growth over the past two decades, and dinuclear complexes are often proposed to facilitate silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations. In this Minireview, we survey and analyze the various roles of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis. We also highlight outstanding questions as well as areas for potential growth and development.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre&#8208;)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.

Dual&#8208;emission (DE) materials have found widespread use in the materials and life sciences. This systematic, tutorial Review offers a clear presentation of the phenomenon and highlights misinterpretations as well as further literature with the aim of promoting the further targeted development of DE materials.







Abstract
There has been much interest in dual&#8208;emission materials in the past few years for materials and life science applications; however, a systematic overview of the underlying processes is so&#8208;far missing. We resolve this issue herein by classifying dual&#8208;emission (DE) phenomena as relying on one emitter with two emitting states (DE1), two independent emitters (DE2), or two correlated emitters (DE3). Relevant DE mechanisms for materials science are then briefly described together with the electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which they occur. For further reading, references are given that offer detailed insight into the complex mechanistic aspects of the various DE processes or provide overviews on materials families or their applications. By avoiding ambiguities and misinterpretations, this systematic, insightful Review might inspire future targeted designs of DE materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Garsubellin&#8197;A</title>

The first enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features use of a dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin&#8197;A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode for biological evaluations.

         <title>Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)&#8208;Guided Peptide Engineering of an Aptamer Sensor for Protease&#8208;Triggered Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22659-22663, October 11, 2021. </description>

A method is proposed for the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer sensor by using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to bridge the gap between peptide and functional DNA. The protease&#8208;triggered biosensor enables ATP imaging with improved specificity for tumor cells.







Abstract
Protease&#8208;triggered control of functional DNA has remained unachieved, leaving a significant gap in activatable DNA biotechnology. Herein, we report the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer system that can perform molecular sensing and imaging in a tumor&#8208;specific manner. The system is constructed by locking the structure&#8208;switching activity of an aptamer using a rationally designed PNA&#8211;peptide&#8211;PNA triblock copolymer. Highly selective protease&#8208;mediated cleavage of the peptide substrate results in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequent recovery of its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system allows for tumor cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging in&#8197;vitro and also produces a fluorescent signal in&#8197;vivo with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA and peptides for precise biomedical applications.

Which coast to take? Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with 1,3&#8208;diynamides and primary or secondary amines result by adding or omitting TBAF. In the absence of TBAF 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles are formed, whereas the addition of TBAF leads selectively to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. The latter pathway involves the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides.







Abstract
Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with various 1,3&#8208;diynamides yielding either 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles or 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines were established. Omitting or adding TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) to the reaction of N,N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodophenyl)(4&#8208;toluenesulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynamides with secondary or primary amines in the presence of KOH in THF and catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3)4 completely changed the outcome of the reaction. In the absence of TBAF, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles were the sole products, while the presence of TBAF switched the product formation to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. Deuterium labeling proceeded selectively at the C3 and C11 positions of the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinoline products and this suggests the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides as reactive key intermediates.

         <title>Insights into the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes through Multispectral Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22672-22677, October 11, 2021. </description>

A multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations is used to obtain new insights into the ionic conduction mechanism, the nature of the solvent molecules, and the interactions among different components in quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix, and solvent, are beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions between different components of QPE remain unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. The Li cations in gel polymer electrolyte are fully solvated by partial solvent molecules to form a local high concentration of Li+, while the other solvent molecules are fastened by polymer matrix in QPE. As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li+ are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and will promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>A Selection of Macrocyclic Peptides That Bind STING From an mRNA&#8208;Display Library With Split Degenerate Codons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22640-22645, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;vitro selection of macrocyclic peptides from a library that uses a 25&#8208;amino&#8208;acid alphabet has allowed the identification of peptides that block binding of human STING to its natural ligand and induce dimerization of STING monomers. Our method splits multiple degenerate codons and reassigns them to non&#8208;natural amino acids.







Abstract
Recent improvements in mRNA display have enabled the selection of peptides that incorporate non&#8208;natural amino acids, thus expanding the chemical diversity of macrocycles beyond what is accessible in nature. Such libraries have incorporated non&#8208;natural amino acids at the expense of natural amino acids by reassigning their codons. Here we report an alternative approach to expanded amino&#8208;acid diversity that preserves all 19 natural amino acids (no methionine) and adds 6 non&#8208;natural amino acids, resulting in the highest sequence complexity reported to date. We have applied mRNA display to this 25&#8208;letter library to select functional macrocycles that bind human STING, a protein involved in immunoregulation. The resulting STING&#8208;binding peptides include a 9&#8208;mer macrocycle with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.4&#8197;nM, which blocks binding of cGAMP to STING and induces STING dimerization. This approach is generalizable to expanding the amino&#8208;acid alphabet in a library beyond 25 building blocks.

Supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis was established as a new platform for organic synthesis. A class of versatile catalysts was discovered which showed catalytic capability in different benchmark reactions, thus demonstrating the wide potential of this catalysis strategy.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centers of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.

Evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of a bioconjugate is reported. The formation of ring&#8208;like structures was independent of different silica particle types and the amount of peptide conjugated to the material. This novel approach paves the way for further production of functional materials for separation, catalysis, and medical applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly processes guide disordered molecules or particles into long&#8208;range organized structures due to specific supramolecular interactions among the building entities. Herein, we report a unique evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) strategy for four different silica nanoparticle systems obtained through peptide functionalization of the particle surface. First, covalent peptide&#8208;silica coupling was investigated in detail, starting with the grafting of a single amino acid (L&#8208;serine) and expanded to specific small peptides (up to four amino acids) and transferred to different particle types (MCM&#8208;48&#8208;type MSNs, solid nanoparticles, and newly developed virus&#8208;like nanoparticles). These materials were investigated regarding their ability to undergo EISA, which was shown to be independent of particle type and amount of peptide anchored to their surface. This EISA&#8208;based approach provides new possibilities for the design of future advanced drug delivery systems, engineered hierarchical sorbents, and nanocatalyst assemblies.

Scissions of sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in an imidazole&#8208;based dithione dimer by stable Lewis bases have been investigated. While NHSi gives a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene complex, both CAAC and NHC provide unusual carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L0) zwitterions.







Abstract
A series of reactions between Lewis bases and an imidazole&#8208;based dithione dimer (1) has been investigated. Both cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) (2) and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) (4), in addition to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi) (6), demonstrate the capability to cleave the sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in 1, giving carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L0) zwitterions (3 and 5) and a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene compound (7), respectively. The bonding nature of 3, 5, and 7 are probed by both experimental and theoretical methods.

         <title>Controlling Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis Activities in Lead&#8208;Free Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 Perovskites via Ion Substitution</title>

A series of Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 perovskites with high water stability demonstrate switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions on variation of the amount of platinum. With low platinum contents, the photocatalytic function is activated and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is achieved in water, whereas with high platinum contents the photoluminescence function is achieved.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have triggered interest in the field of optoelectronics and photocatalysis because of their low toxicity, and tunable optical and charge&#8208;carrier properties. From an application point of view, it is desirable to develop stable multifunctional lead&#8208;free halide perovskites. We have developed a series of Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 perovskites (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with high stability, which show switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions by varying the amount of Pt4+ substitution. A Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 solid solution with a dominant proportion of Pt4+ shows broadband photoluminescence with a lifetime on the microsecond timescale. A Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 solid solution with a small amount of Pt4+ substitution exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. An optical spectroscopy study reveals that the switch between photoluminescence and photocatalysis functions is controlled by sub&#8208;band gap states. Our finding provides a new way to develop lead&#8208;free multifunctional halide perovskites with high stability.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Nickel&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22740-22744, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both theoretical simulations and in&#8197;situ experiments demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode and improves the seawater oxidation stability.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and in situ experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion. The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ca. 5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.

         <title>Inhibition of S.&#8197;aureus Infection of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) by Trehalose&#8208; and Glucose&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Due to increased resistance against antibiotics, the fight against bacteria is becoming increasingly difficult. Here, we used a sugar that is unique to the bacteria metabolism, trehalose, and prepared trehalose&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to inhibit the infection of healthy cells by S.&#8197;aureus and could serve as a non&#8208;toxic alternative to prevent adhesion of certain bacteria.







Abstract
Microbial adhesion to host cells represents the initial step in the infection process. Several methods have been explored to inhibit microbial adhesion including the use of glycopolymers based on mannose, galactose, sialic acid and glucose. These sugar receptors are, however, abundant in the body, and are not unique to bacteria. Trehalose, in contrast, is a unique disaccharide that is widely expressed by microbes. This carbohydrate has not yet been explored as an anti&#8208;adhesive agent. Herein, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with trehalose&#8208;based polymers were prepared and compared to glucose&#8208;functionalized AuNPs and examined for their ability to prevent binding to endothelial cells. Acting as anti&#8208;adhesive agents, trehalose&#8208;functionalized NPs decreased the binding of S.&#8197;aureus to HUVECs, while outperforming the control NPs. Microscopy revealed that trehalose&#8208;coated NPs bound strongly to S.&#8197;aureus compared to the controls. In conclusion, nanoparticles based on trehalose could be a non&#8208;toxic alternative to inhibit S.&#8197;aureus infection.

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

Compressive strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites could boost the catalytic activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites with 1.5&#8201;% compressed Fe&#8722;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.

&lt;p&gt;Compressive strain engineering of curved single atomic iron-nitrogen sites could boost the catalytic activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron-nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high-curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self-assembled chiral surfactants. The high-curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites with 1.5&#8201;% compressed Fe&#8722;N bonds exhibit downshifted d-band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three-dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Nitrene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Oxaziridination/1,2&#8208;Alkyl Rearrangement of 1,3&#8208;Diketones toward Bicyclic Lactams</title>

Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations have been limited to the aziridination of C=C double bonds. In this study, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed oxaziridination of C=O double bonds and achieved a tandem asymmetric oxaziridination/rearrangement reaction of cyclic diketones, affording a series of bicyclic lactams bearing a quaternary carbon center.







Abstract
Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.

&#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular derivatives of pinacol (Bpin), are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors, generating &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals from H2 in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst. These radicals undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations onto appropriate double bonds, eventually furnishing densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals can be stabilized by delocalization of their spin density into the vacant p orbital of a boron substituent. &#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular pinacol (Bpin) derivatives, are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors. Under H2, in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst, they generate &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals; these species can undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations if appropriate double bond acceptors are present, leading to densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance with wide scope, and the resulting boronate products can be converted into other useful functionalities.

2D porphyrinic nanosheets were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts to mediate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization of different monomers under a broad range of light wavelengths. This system exhibits oxygen tolerance and temporal control resulting in the preparation of well&#8208;defined polymers. Nanosheets were utilized to catalyze stereolithographic 3D printing, providing reinforced mechanical properties and effective antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
Ultrathin porphyrinic 2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets (TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were achieved. The polymers showed narrow molecular weight distributions and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were applied as photocatalysts in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects. Apart from providing an efficient catalytic system, 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials. The presence of ZnTCPP embedded in the materials conferred effective antimicrobial activity under visible light by production of singlet oxygen, affording 98&#8201;% and 93&#8201;% anti&#8208;bacterial efficiency against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, respectively.

         <title>Stable Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Directly regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by an anion receptor was proposed for the construction of a stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The introduction of an anion receptor decreases the reduction stability of FSI&#8722; and increases the amount of FSI&#8722; in the form of AGG&#8208;II. The decomposition of FSI&#8722; to form Li2S is promoted, improving the stability of the anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries are severely hindered by the dendritic Li deposition dictated by non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Despite its unique advantages in improving the uniformity of Li deposition, the current anion&#8208;derived SEI is unsatisfactory under practical conditions. Herein regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by anion receptors was proposed to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) anion acceptors with electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms interact with bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8722;) and decrease the reduction stability of FSI&#8722;. Furthermore, the type of aggregate cluster of FSI&#8722; in electrolyte changes, FSI&#8722; interacting with more Li ions in the presence of TPFPB. Therefore, the decomposition of FSI&#8722; to form Li2S is promoted, improving the stability of anion&#8208;derived SEI. In working Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries under practical conditions, the anion&#8208;derived SEI with TPFPB undergoes 194 cycles compared with 98&#8197;cycles of routine anion&#8208;derived SEI. This work inspires a fresh ground to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI by manipulating the electrolyte structure of anions.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Imaging of m6A Modified RNA Using m6A&#8208;Specific In Situ Hybridization Mediated Proximity Ligation Assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA)</title>

We design a m6A&#8208;specific in situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA) for in situ visualization of m6A modified RNA (m6A RNA) in single cells. This technique shows excellent recognition specificity of m6A modification at specific location in mRNA and in situ visualization ability of single&#8208;molecule resolution.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification&#8212;the most prevalent mammalian RNA internal modification&#8212;plays key regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism. Current approaches for m6A modified RNA analysis limit at bulk&#8208;population level, resulting in a loss of spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information. Here we proposed a m6A&#8208;specific in situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA) for cellular imaging of m6A RNA, allowing to identify m6A modification at specific location in RNAs and image m6A RNA with single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule resolution. Using m6AISH&#8208;PLA, we investigated the m6A level and subcellular location of HSP70 RNA103&#8208;m6A in response to heat shock stress, and found an increased m6A modified ratio and an increased distribution ratio in cytoplasm under heat shock. m6AISH&#8208;PLA can serve in the study of m6A RNA in single cells for deciphering epitranscriptomic mechanisms and assisting clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22711-22716, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond mediated supramolecular assembly with chiral fractal structure is demonstrated in axially chiral pyridine&#8208;based molecules and 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The assembly shows asymmetry amplification both in ground state and excited state, and the enhancement of the chirality can be assigned to the hierarchical chirality transfer from molecule to chiral fractal structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to their great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains unknown how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly via halogen bonds, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (F4DIB) and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometer scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatics Enabled by Regioselective Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic compounds with interesting geometry and useful properties (see picture) were synthesized by Scholl reactions, which enabled oxidative coupling of carbazole units in a regioselective manner. A nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
The synthesis of new carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatics with interesting geometry and useful properties was explored using Scholl reactions. As found from the Scholl reactions of substrates having two carbazole units linked at different positions through o&#8208;phenylene, oxidative coupling of carbazole units occurred in a regioselective manner with new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds preferably formed at C3 and C4 in N&#8208;alkyl carbazoles. A new N&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors.

As a CRISPR&#8208;Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR associated proteins), Cas14a1 can cis/trans cleave single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). Here, we describe an unreported capacity of Cas14a1: RNA can trigger the trans ssDNA cleavage. This Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated detection platform (Amplification, Transcription, Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated trans ssDNA cleavage, ATCas&#8208;RNA) has an outstanding specificity for the detection of target RNAs with point mutation resolution, which is better than that of the Cas14a1&#8208;based ssDNA&#8208;activation. Using ATCas&#8208;RNA via a fluorophore quencher&#8208;labeled ssDNA reporter (FQ), we were able to detect 1&#8197;aM pathogenic nucleic acid within 1&#8197;h, and achieve 100&#8201;% accuracy with 25 milk samples. This platform can serve as a new tool for high&#8208;efficiency nucleic acid diagnostics. Importantly, this work can expand our understanding of Cas14a1 and inspire further mechanisms and applications of Class&#8208;2 Cas systems.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 Antigen to Overcome the Hydrolytic Instability of O&#8208;Acetylated&#8208;GD2 for Anticancer Conjugate Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potential anticancer vaccine was produced by the conjugation of bacteriophage Q&#946; virus&#8208;like particle with the chemoenzymatically synthesized 9&#8208;NHAc&#8208;GD2 mimic of the 9&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD2 antigen. The conjugate produced robust and long&#8208;lasting IgG responses in mice and canines with no observed adverse effects.







Abstract
Ganglioside GD2 is an attractive tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen for anti&#8208;cancer vaccine development. However, its low immunogenicity and the significant side effects observed with anti&#8208;GD2 antibodies present significant obstacles for vaccines. To overcome these, a new GD2 derivative bearing an N&#8208;acetamide (NHAc) at its non&#8208;reducing end neuraminic acid (9NHAc&#8208;GD2) has been designed to mimic the 9&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated&#8208;GD2 (9OAc&#8208;GD2), a GD2 based antigen with a restricted expression on tumor cells. 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 was synthesized efficiently via a chemoenzymatic method and subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;9NHAc&#8208;GD2 conjugate elicited strong and long&#8208;lasting IgG antibodies, which were highly selective toward 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 with little cross&#8208;recognition of GD2. Immunization of canines with Q&#946;&#8208;9NHAc&#8208;GD2 showed the construct was immunogenic in canines with little adverse effects, paving the way for future clinical translation to humans.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Dimeric Aptamers Enable the Rapid Electrochemical Detection of Wild&#8208;Type and B.1.1.7 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Unprocessed Saliva</title>

         <dc:description>
Rapid and simple: an electrochemical sensor, based on a high&#8208;affinity dimeric DNA aptamer for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein was developed to detect the wildtype and Alpha and Delta variant in unprocessed saliva samples in 10&#8197;minutes, providing a detection limit of 1000&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1, clinical sensitivity of 80.5&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report a simple and rapid saliva&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigen test that utilizes a newly developed dimeric DNA aptamer, denoted as DSA1N5, that specifically recognizes the spike proteins of the wildtype virus and its Alpha and Delta variants with dissociation constants of 120, 290 and 480&#8197;pM, respectively, and binds pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the wildtype and alpha trimeric spike proteins with affinity constants of 2.1&#8197;pM and 2.3&#8197;pM, respectively. To develop a highly sensitive test, DSA1N5 was immobilized onto gold electrodes to produce an electrochemical impedance sensor, which was capable of detecting 1000 viral particles per mL in 1:1 diluted saliva in under 10&#8197;min without any further sample processing. Evaluation of 36 positive and 37 negative patient saliva samples produced a clinical sensitivity of 80.5&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% and the sensor could detect the wildtype virus as well as the Alpha and Delta variants in the patient samples, which is the first reported rapid test that can detect any emerging variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Engineering Fluorophore Recycling in a Fluorogenic RNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic RNA aptamers bind to and activate the fluorescence of otherwise nonfluorescent dyes. Here we show an approach to maximize their fluorescence by reducing the impact of photobleaching. We engineered TBI, a fluorophore that rapidly dissociates upon photobleaching and can be rapidly replaced by TBI in the media. By maximizing &#8220;fluorophore recycling&#8221;, we achieve higher fluorescence and enable long&#8208;term fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Fluorogenic aptamers can potentially show minimal photobleaching during continuous irradiation since any photobleached fluorophore can exchange with fluorescent dyes in the media. However, fluorophores have not been designed to maximize &#8220;fluorophore recycling.&#8221; Here we describe TBI, a novel fluorophore for the Broccoli fluorogenic aptamer. Previous fluorophores either fail to rapidly dissociate when they undergo photobleaching via cis&#8211;trans isomerization, or bind slowly, resulting in extended periods after dissociation of the photobleached fluorophore when no fluorophore is bound. By contrast, photobleached TBI dissociates rapidly from Broccoli, and TBI from the media rapidly replaces dissociated photobleached fluorophore. Using TBI, Broccoli exhibits markedly enhanced fluorescence in cells during continuous imaging. These data show that designing fluorophores to optimize fluorophore recycling can lead to enhanced fluorescence of fluorogenic aptamers.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Enhanced Antimicrobial Activity of Polymers Containing an Embedded Photosensitiser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding a photosensitiser monomer within antimicrobial polymer formulations provides two distinct mechanisms of antibacterial activity for a broader spectrum of action.







Abstract
This work presents the synthesis of a novel photosensitive acrylate monomer for use as both a self&#8208;catalyst in the photoinduced electron/energy transfer&#8211;reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation process and a photosensitiser (PS) for antibacterial applications. Hydrophilic, cationic, and antimicrobial formulations are explored to compare the antibacterial effects between charged and non&#8208;charged polymers. Covalent attachment of the catalyst to well&#8208;defined linear polymer chains has no effect on polymerisation control or singlet oxygen generation. The addition of the PS to polymers provides activity against S.&#8197;aureus for all polymer formulations, resulting in up to a 99.99999&#8201;% killing efficacy in 30&#8197;min. Antimicrobial peptide mimetic polymers previously active against P.&#8197;aeruginosa, but not S.&#8197;aureus, gain significant bactericidal activity against S.&#8197;aureus through the inclusion of PS groups, with 99.998&#8201;% killing efficiency after 30&#8197;min incubation with light. Thus, a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity is achieved using two distinct mechanisms of bactericidal activity via the incorporation of a photosensitiser monomer into an antimicrobial polymer.

         <dc:description>
Two fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers bearing hydrophilic branched methyl end&#8208;capped glycol side chains were developed, showing a high degree of backbone planarity, favorable polymer chain packing orientation, and substantial electrochemical doping efficiency. As a result, the f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) deliver a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 4.60&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind their p&#8208;type counterparts. In order to address this dilemma, we report here two new fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers with a branched methyl end&#8208;capped glycol side chain, which exhibit good solubility, low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels, favorable polymer chain orientation, and efficient ion transport property, thus yielding a remarkable OECT electron mobility (&#956;e) of up to &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and volumetric capacitance (C*) as high as 443&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3, simultaneously. As a result, the f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT&#8208;based OECTs deliver a record&#8208;high maximum geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 4.60&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum &#956;C* product of 15.2&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The &#956;C* figure of merit is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type OECTs. The emergence of f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT brings a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for low&#8208;power OECT applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) multicolor heterostructures have shown great potential for achieving anti&#8208;counterfeit applications. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109336), Zhenhua Gao, Xiangeng Meng, Yong&#8197;Sheng Zhao et&#8197;al. have developed a strategy to construct 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures. The domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors in these 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs epitaxial heterostructures allow for definition of 2D photonic barcodes, which could be used for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Frequency Fingerprint for Ion Interaction Networks in a Confined Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like a music box, in nanopore single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprinting a rotating metal cylinder (an analyte) uses perfectly placed pins (the chemical groups of an analyte) that come up under the comb (the characteristic residue inside the nanopore inner wall) to strike the appropriate prongs or tines of that comb (confined interactions). In this way, each analyte generates a characteristic fingerprint frequency as it undergoes the confined interactions with the nanopore, as explained by Yi&#8208;Lun Ying, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108226).

         <dc:description>Photothermal materials with broadband optical absorption and high conversion efficiency are intensively pursued to date. Here, proposing by the  d&#8208;d  interband transitions, we report an unprecedented high&#8208;entropy alloy FeCoNiTiVCrCu nanoparticles that the energy regions below and above the Fermi level (&#177;4 eV) have been fully filled by the 3  d  transition metals, which realizes an average absorbance greater than 96% in the entire solar spectrum (wavelength of 250 to 2500 nm). Furthermore, we also calculated the photothermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation rate towards the steam generation. Due to its pronounced full light capture and ultrafast local heating, our high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle&#8208;based solar steam generator has over 98% efficiency under one sun irradiation, meanwhile enabling a high evaporation rate of 2.26 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensionality Control of Inorganic and Hybrid Perovskite Nanocrystals by Reaction Temperature: From No&#8208;Confinement to 3D and 1D Quantum Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work focuses on the systematic investigation of the shape, size, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) under inert gas&#8208;free conditions and using pre&#8208;synthesized precursor stock solutions. In the case of CsPbBr  3  NC, we find that the lowering of reaction temperature from ~175 to 100  o  C initially leads to a change of morphology from bulk&#8208;like 3D nanocubes to 0D nanocubes with 3D&#8208;quantum confinement, while at temperatures below 100  o  C the reaction yields 2D nanoplatelets (NPls) with 1D&#8208;quantum confinement. However, to our surprise, at higher temperatures (~215  o  C), the reaction yields CsPbBr  3  hexapod NCs, which have been rarely reported. The synthesis is scalable, and their halide composition is tunable by simply using different combinations of precursor solutions. The versatility of the synthesis is demonstrated by applying it to relatively less explored shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of FAPbBr  3  NCs. Despite the synthesis carried out in the air, both the inorganic and hybrid perovskite NCs exhibit nearly&#8208;narrow emission without applying any size&#8208;selective separation, and it is precisely tunable by controlling the reaction temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective catalytic Frustrated Lewis Pair Hydrogenation of CO2 in the Presence of Silylhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The FLP derived from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and B(C  6  F  5  )  3  is shown to mediate the catalytic hydrogenation of CO  2  using H  2  as the reductant and a silylhalide as an oxophile. The nature of the products can be controlled with the judicious selection of the silylhalide and the solvent. In this fashion, this metal&#8208;free catalysis affords avenues to the selective formation of the disilylacetal (R  3  SiOCH  2  OSiR  3  ), methoxysilane (R  3  SiOCH  3  ), methyliodide (CH  3  I) and methane (CH  4  ) under mild conditions. DFT studies illuminate the complexities of the mechanism and account for the observed selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental observation of hydrocarbon growth by resonance stabilized radical&#8208;radical chain reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid molecular weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8208;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C  6  H  5  ) and benzyl (c&#8208;C  6  H  5  CH  2  ) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8208;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8208;1600 K) and low pressure (~3 kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>ROS/RNS and Base Dual Activatable Merocyanine&#8208;Based NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Molecular Probe for in vivo Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammation usually results in high&#8208;level reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) not only in acidic tissue but also in alkaline tissue. However, noninvasively  in vivo  monitoring reactive species specifically within alkaline tissue remains a huge challenge. Here we introduce a dual activatable fluorescent probe PN910 located in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 900&#8208;1700 nm), which shows high selectivity toward H  2  O  2  and OONO  &#8208;  at pH beyond 7.4. Then we verified that PN910 could be used for the real&#8208;time, specific and accurate monitoring of cystitis and colitis for living animals. This report presents a unique approach to the development of dual activatable probe for  in vivo  biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Super&#8208;Assembly of Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Silica/AAO Hybrid Membrane with Enhanced Permselectivity for Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Regulated Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic devices have been widely used for diode&#8208;like ion transport and salinity gradients energy conversion. Emerging reverse electrodialysis (RED) nanofluidic systems based on nanochannel membrane display great superiority in salinity gradient energy harvesting. However, the imbalance between permeability and selectivity limits their practical application. Here, we fabricate a new mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anodized aluminum (MCS/AAO) nanofluidic device with enhanced permselectivity for temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated energy generation. A maximum power density of 5.04 W/m2 is achieved, and a higher performance can be obtained by regulating temperature and pH. Theoretical calculations are further implemented to reveal the mechanism for ion rectification, ion selectivity and energy conversion. Results show that the MCS/AAO hybrid membrane has great superiority in diode&#8208;like ion transport, temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated salinity gradient energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hindrance of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode via Surface Gradient Penetration of Tantalum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, they still suffer from poor rate capability and low specific capacity due to the severe kinetic hindrance at the nondilute state during Li  +&#160;  intercalation. Herein, combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that this obstacle can be tackled by regulating the oxidation state of nickel via injecting high&#8208;valence foreign Ta  5+  . The as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;crystalline LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  delivers a high specific capacity (211.2 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C), high initial Coulombic efficiency (93.8%), excellent rate capability (157 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 4 C), and good durability (90.4% after 100 cycles under 0.5 C). This work provides a strategy to mitigate the Li  +  kinetic hindrance of the appealing single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and will inspire peers to conduct an intensive study.</dc:description>

Our reaction enantioselectively constructs carbon&#8208;phosphine bonds and prepares chiral phosphines  with high optical purities. The phosphine products are suitable for transforming to chiral ligands or catalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis. The diarylalkyl or trialkyl phosphine products from our catalytic reactions, air&#8208;sensitive and reactive in nature, can be trapped (and stored) in their sulfur&#8208;oxidized form for operational simplicities.</dc:description>

         <title>Fire&#8208;retardant, stable&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety sodium ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt; 85% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7%).</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;ion intercalation and high volumetric capacitance in a two&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;porous coordination polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercalation is a promising ion sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to electrochemical surface area. It requires rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material and it must occur without phase transformation. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do, intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni  3  (benzenehexathiol) (Ni  3  BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni  3  BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of C&#8208;C Axial Chirality via Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Arene C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using diazonaphthoquinones and anilines as key reagents and through a point&#8208;to&#8208;axis chiral transfer strategy, the atroposelective synthesis via asymmetric C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bond insertion reaction of arenes has been realized under rhodium catalysis, providing the resulting biaryl atropisomers in moderate to excellent yields with good enantiomeric ratios (up to 99:1). Further elaboration indicates this type of axially biaryl scaffold may have promising potentials in developing novel chiral ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine as a reagent for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. In this report we introduce&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the&#160;production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from&#160;S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of&#160;small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;component Reaction to 1,4,2&#8208;Diazaborole&#8208;type Heteroarene Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borane FmesBH  2  reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivative with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>
