         <title>Positional Thiophene Isomerization: A Geometric Strategy for Precisely Regulating the Electronic State of Covalent Organic Frameworks to Boost Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge&#8208;hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substitution and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well&#8208;regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;&#8208;electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon&#8208;based COF model COF&#8208;Ph achieves excellent activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (COF&#8208;&#945; and COF&#8208;&#946;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#945;&#8208;position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with suitable geometry construction.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldaxane&#8208;Based Switchable [c2]Daisy Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial molecular muscles have hold extensive attractions in the field of molecular machinery due to their unique properties of contraction and stretching motion. However, the synthesis of molecular muscles poses formidable challenges as it is hindered by undesirable yields and poor selectivity. Herein, we present a protocol for dynamic assembly of foldaxane&#8208;based [c2]daisy chains, wherein the hermaphroditic sequences consisting of aromatic helices and peptide rods are interlocked through inter&#8208;strand hydrogen bonding interactions. The binding complementarity facilitates a selective and efficient assembly of [c2]daisy chain structures, validly inhibiting the creation of byproducts. Introducing multiple recognition sites confers the system upon contraction and stretching motion actuated by chemical stimuli. The rate of this muscle&#8208;like motion is calculated to be 0.8 s&#8208;1, which is 107 times faster than that of complex dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrokinetic Analyses Uncover the Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Biomass&#8208;Derived Monosaccharide Electroreduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical biomass conversion holds promise to upcycle carbon sources and produce valuable products while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, deep insight into the interfacial mechanism is essential for the rational design of an efficient electrocatalytic route, which is still an area of active research and development. Herein, we report the reduction of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) &#8211; the simplest monosaccharide derived from glycerol feedstock &#8211; to acetol, the vital chemical intermediate in industries, with faradaic efficiency of 85 &#177; 5% on a polycrystalline Cu electrode. DHA reduction follows preceding dehydration by coordination with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups and the subsequent hydrogenation. The electrokinetic profile indicates that the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) includes a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the dehydrated intermediate, revealed by coverage&#8208;dependent Tafel slope and isotopic labeling experiments. An approximate zero&#8208;order dependence of H+ suggests that water acts as the proton donor for the interfacial PCET process. Leveraging these insights, we formulate microkinetic models to illustrate its origin that Eley&#8208;Rideal (E&#8208;R) dominates over Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8208;H) in governing Cu&#8208;mediated DHA reduction, offering rational guidance that increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone would be sufficient to promote the activity in designing practical catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene &#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Multimodal Tumor Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of a multimodal phototheranostic platform on the basis of single&#8208;component theranostic agent to afford both imaging and therapy simultaneously, is attractive yet full of challenges. The emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), particularly those emit fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), provides a powerful tool for cancer treatment by virtue of adjustable pathway for radiative/non&#8208;radiative energy consumption, deeper penetration depth and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance. Although bulky thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridges such as ortho&#8208;alkylated thiophene, 3,4&#8208;ethoxylene dioxythiophene and benzo[c]thiophene are commonly adopted to construct NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, the subtle differentiation on their theranostic behaviours has yet to be comprehensively investigated. In this work, systematical investigations discovered that AIEgen BT&#8208;NS bearing benzo[c]thiophene possesses acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission intensity, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Eventually, by using of BT&#8208;NS nanoparticles, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal elimination of tumors was demonstrated. This study thus offers useful insights into developing versatile phototheranostic systems for clinical trials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation of Different Active Sites to Promote CO2 Electroreduction to   Multi &#8208;carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi&#8208;sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd&#8208;Cu). It was found that the Pd&#8208;Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8%, even at a high current density of 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 for at least 20 hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70% at 1.4 A cm&#8208;2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structural Role of N170 in Substrate&#8208;Assisted Deacylation in KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;Lactamase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) alter its structure and function and can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics. Accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations have now revealed that in D179 variants of KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;lactamase, the N170 side chain can rotate away from the active site, allowing the binding of antibiotics such as moxalactam and ceftazidime.







Abstract
The amino acid substitutions in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) that have arisen in the clinic are observed to lead to the development of resistance to ceftazidime&#8208;avibactam, a preferred treatment for KPC bearing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) result in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, leading to alterations in substrate specificity, decreased stability, and more recently observed, increased resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam. Using accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations, we explored in detail the structural role of R164 and D179 variants that are described to confer ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The buried conformation of D179 substitutions produce a pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop &#8208; more than R164 mutants, where the crystallographic omega loop structure remains mostly intact. Our findings also reveal that the conformation of N170 plays an underappreciated role impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation. The results further support the hypothesis that KPC&#8208;2 D179 variants employ substrate&#8208;assisted catalysis for ceftazidime hydrolysis, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover. Moreover, the shift in the WT conformation of N170 contributes to reduced deacylation and an altered spectrum of enzymatic activity.

&lt;p&gt;Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164-D179) of &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2) alter its structure and function and can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics. Accelerated rare-event sampling well-tempered metadynamics simulations have now revealed that in D179 variants of KPC-2 &#946;-lactamase, the N170 side chain can rotate away from the active site, allowing the binding of antibiotics such as moxalactam and ceftazidime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amino acid substitutions in &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2) that have arisen in the clinic are observed to lead to the development of resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam, a preferred treatment for KPC bearing Gram-negative bacteria. Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164-D179) result in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, leading to alterations in substrate specificity, decreased stability, and more recently observed, increased resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam. Using accelerated rare-event sampling well-tempered metadynamics simulations, we explored in detail the structural role of R164 and D179 variants that are described to confer ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The buried conformation of D179 substitutions produce a pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop - more than R164 mutants, where the crystallographic omega loop structure remains mostly intact. Our findings also reveal that the conformation of N170 plays an underappreciated role impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation. The results further support the hypothesis that KPC-2 D179 variants employ substrate-assisted catalysis for ceftazidime hydrolysis, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover. Moreover, the shift in the WT conformation of N170 contributes to reduced deacylation and an altered spectrum of enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Vinyl Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy for the direct conversion of aziridines into 2&#8208;vinyl azetidines via one&#8208;carbon insertion using vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is described. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Azetidines, being four&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value&#8208;added 2&#8208;alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step&#8208;economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate. Experimental investigations, coupled with computational studies, suggest that a diradical pathway is involved in the reaction mechanism.

         <title>2D Metal/Graphene and 2D Metal/Graphene/Metal Systems for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong covalent bonding between metal monolayer and graphene driven by the sp and d orbital hybridization, 2D metal/graphene (M/G) system is investigated. The charge transfer from metal to graphene allows for the electrodeposition of another metal film, thus forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) system. These 2D hybrid systems exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward formic acid production over competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Efficiently transforming CO2 into renewable energy sources is crucial for decarbonization efforts. Formic acid (HCOOH) holds great promise as a hydrogen storage compound due to its high hydrogen density, non&#8208;toxicity, and stability under ambient conditions. However, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) on conventional carbon black&#8208;supported metal catalysts faces challenges such as low stability through dissolution and agglomeration, as well as suffering from high overpotentials and the necessity to overcome the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we modify the physical/chemical properties of metal surfaces by depositing metal monolayers on graphene (M/G) to create highly active and stable electrocatalysts. Strong covalent bonding between graphene and metal is induced by the hybridization of sp and d orbitals, especially the sharp 
, 
, and 
 orbitals of metals near the Fermi level, playing a decisive role. Moreover, charge polarization on graphene in M/G enables the deposition of another thin metallic film, forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) structures. Finally, evaluating overpotentials required for CO2 reduction to HCOOH, CO, and HER, we find that Pd/G, Pt/G/Ag, and Pt/G/Au exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward HCOOH production. Our novel 2D hybrid catalyst design methodology may offer insights into enhanced electrochemical reactions through the electronic mixing of metal and other p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>Operando Mobile Catalysis for Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando mobile catalysis enables the formation of mobile metal species during the reaction and enhances the catalytic efficiency by increasing the collision probability with the intermediates.







Abstract
Metal atoms on the support serve as active sites for many heterogeneous catalysts. However, the active metal sites on the support are conventionally described as static, and the intermediates adsorbed on the support far away from the active metal sites cannot be transformed. Herein, we report the first example of operando mobile catalysis to promote catalytic efficiency by enhancing the collision probability between active sites and reactants or reaction intermediates. Specifically, ligand&#8208;coordinated Pt single atoms (isolated MeCpPt&#8208; species) are bonded on CeO2 and transformed into mobile MeCpPt(H)CO complexes during the reverse water gas shift reaction for operando mobile catalysis. This strategy enables the conversion of inert carbonate intermediates on the CeO2 support. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 6358&#8197;mol&#8197;CO2&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 99&#8201;% CO selectivity at 300&#8201;&#176;C is obtained for reverse water gas shift reaction, dramatically higher than those of Pt catalysts reported in the literature. Operando mobile catalysis presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions and applications.

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Specific Dual Modification of Peptides through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of peptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, affording the chemically robust pyrrolidine ring in excellent yields with complete exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific introduction of multiple components into peptides is greatly needed for the preparation of densely functionalized and structurally uniform peptides. In this regard, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific peptide modification is attractive, but it can be difficult due to the presence of highly nucleophilic lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine. In this work, we developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of iminopeptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, thus affording the cycloadducts in excellent yields. Tolerating a broad range of functional groups and molecules, the present method provides the opportunity to rapidly construct doubly functionalized peptides using readily accessible aldehyde and maleimide modules.

         <title>Engineering Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr Cross&#8208;Interfacial Electron Bridges to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off for Superdurable Bifunctional Single Atom Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;interfacial electronic bridges (CIEBs) is constructed via interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates.

Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#9653;E=0.70&#8197;V) and breakthrough durability including 100&#8201;% current retention after 10&#8197;h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.

         <title>Cubic Iodide LixYI3+x Superionic Conductors through Defect Manipulation for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating defects within a highly symmetric iodide crystal has successfully yielded a remarkable ionic conductivity exceeding 1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature in a novel Li4YI7 solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This achievement not only demonstrates its promising compatibility with lithium metal but also enables the realization of high&#8208;performance iodide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide SEs receiving less attention. Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x=2, 3, 4, or 9). Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C for Li4YI7. Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Stilbene Pairs in a DNA Duplex Mediated by Ruthenium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to site&#8208;specifically crosslink DNA duplex upon visible light irradiation. Ru complex on the third strand catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site specificity is realized owing to steep distance dependence of the energy transfer. This method will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.







Abstract
We herein report a method for site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of a DNA duplex. A stilbene pair was introduced into a DNA duplex and a ruthenium complex was conjugated with a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide. We demonstrated that [2+2] photocycloaddition of the stilbene pair occurred upon irradiation with visible light when the ruthenium complex was in close proximity due to triplex formation. No reaction occurred when the ruthenium complex was not in proximity to the stilbene pair. The wavelength of visible light used was of lower energy than the wavelength of UV light necessary for direct excitation of stilbene. Quantum chemical calculation indicated that ruthenium complex catalyzed the photocycloaddition via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site selectivity of this photo&#8208;crosslinking system was evaluated using a DNA duplex bearing two stilbene pairs as a substrate; we showed that the site of crosslinking was precisely regulated by the sequence of the oligonucleotide linked to the ruthenium complex. Since this method does not require orthogonal photoresponsive molecules, it will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.

         <title>Coarse&#8208;Grained Model&#8208;Assisted Design of Polymer Prodrug Nanoparticles with Enhanced Cytotoxicity: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting relative drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation has been developed. This hypothesis was experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs, which demonstrated greater drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines.







Abstract
To achieve drug release from polymer prodrug nanoparticles, the drug&#8208;polymer linker must be accessible for cleavage to release the drug, which can occur under certain physiological conditions (e.g., presence of specific enzymes). Supramolecular organization of polymer prodrug nanoparticles is crucial as it greatly affects the location of the linker, its surface exposure/solvation and thus its cleavage to release the drug. Since experimental access to these data is not straightforward, new methodologies are critically needed to access this information and to accelerate the development of more effective polymer prodrug nanoparticles, and replace the time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategy. In this context, we reported here the use of a coarse&#8208;grained model to assist the design of polymer prodrug nanoparticles with enhanced cytotoxicity. By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, we developed an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation. Our hypothesis was then experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs (gemcitabine and paclitaxel), which demonstrated greater performances in terms of drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines. Interestingly, our methodology can be easily applied to other polymer prodrug structures, which would contribute to the development of more efficient drug delivery systems via in silico screening.

         <title>Molecular Crystals Constructed by Polar Molecular Cages: A Promising System for Exploring High&#8208;performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular crystals with polar molecular cages were firstly proposed as a promising system for exploring superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, the binary chalcogenide family P4Sn (n=3&#8211;9), is introduced. As a member of the system, &#945;&#8208;P4S5 possesses a robust SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), a broad band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), ample birefringence (0.134@2050 nm), a wide optical transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m), and exceptional water&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
Polar molecular crystals, with their densely stacked polar nonlinear optical (NLO) active units, are favored for their large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses and birefringence. However, their potential for practical applications as Infrared (IR) NLO materials has historically been underappreciated due to the weak inter&#8208;molecular interaction forces that may compromise their physicochemical properties. In this study, we propose molecular crystals with polar molecular cages as a treasure&#8208;house for the development of superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, binary chalcogenide molecular crystals, composed of [P4Sn] (n=3&#8211;9) polar molecular cages, is introduced. These crystals may not only achieve wide band gap, large SHG response, and birefringence in a single structure, but also exhibit favorable physicochemical properties. We subsequently obtained a polar molecular crystal, &#945;&#8208;P4S5, which demonstrated exceptional IR optical properties, including a strong SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), wide band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), large birefringence (0.134@2050&#8197;nm), and a broad transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m). Moreover, it showed excellent water resistance and hardness. These findings highlight the potential of polar molecular crystals as a promising platform for the development of high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular crystals with polar molecular cages were firstly proposed as a promising system for exploring superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, the binary chalcogenide family P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (n=3&#8211;9), is introduced. As a member of the system, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; possesses a robust SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), a broad band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), ample birefringence (0.134@2050 nm), a wide optical transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m), and exceptional water-resistance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar molecular crystals, with their densely stacked polar nonlinear optical (NLO) active units, are favored for their large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses and birefringence. However, their potential for practical applications as Infrared (IR) NLO materials has historically been underappreciated due to the weak inter-molecular interaction forces that may compromise their physicochemical properties. In this study, we propose molecular crystals with polar molecular cages as a treasure-house for the development of superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, binary chalcogenide molecular crystals, composed of [P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=3&#8211;9) polar molecular cages, is introduced. These crystals may not only achieve wide band gap, large SHG response, and birefringence in a single structure, but also exhibit favorable physicochemical properties. We subsequently obtained a polar molecular crystal, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which demonstrated exceptional IR optical properties, including a strong SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), wide band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), large birefringence (0.134@2050&#8197;nm), and a broad transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m). Moreover, it showed excellent water resistance and hardness. These findings highlight the potential of polar molecular crystals as a promising platform for the development of high-performance IR NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Threading a Linear Molecule Through a Macrocycle Thanks to Boron: Optical Properties of the Threaded Species and Synthesis of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;containing species were threaded through macrocycles bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit. The new threaded species exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91&#8201;% and an enhanced photostability. Their properties were rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. This methodology was used to synthesize a rotaxane.







Abstract
Two BODIPYs and two boron &#946;&#8208;diketonates were threaded through a macrocycle bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit, showing thus the ability of boron to act as a gathering atom. The new threaded species were characterized by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as by X&#8208;ray crystallography for one of them and their properties rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. The BODIPYs exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91&#8201;% and enhanced photostability compared to their non&#8208;threaded homologues. A rotaxane was synthesized using this threading strategy after stoppering and removing the boron with potassium hydroxide.

         <title>Spin&#8208;state Conversion by Asymmetrical Orbital Hybridization in Ni&#8208;doped Co3O4 to Boost Singlet Oxygen Generation for Microbial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of Ni into the octahedral site of Co3O4 effectively induced a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition, thereby enhancing the activity of 1O2 generation. We further explored the spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions between the catalysts and intermediates, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the 1O2 generation. This work deepens the understanding about orbital interactions and spin states.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role in environmental and biomedical disinfection fields. Electrocatalytic processes hold great potential for 1O2 generation, but remain challenging. Herein, a facile Ni doping converted spin&#8208;state transition approach is reported for boosting 1O2 production. Magnetic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that Ni occupied at the octahedral site of Co3O4 can effectively induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8722;Co3O4 generate appropriate binding strength and enhance electron transfer between the Co centers with oxygen intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni&#8722;Co3O4 for effective generating 1O2. In neutral conditions, 1&#215;106&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 Gram&#8208;negative ESBL&#8208;producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) could be inactivated by Ni&#8722;Co3O4 system within 5&#8197;min. Further antibacterial mechanisms indicate that 1O2 can lead to cell membrane damage and DNA degradation so as to irreversible cell death. Additionally, the developed Ni&#8722;Co3O4 system can effectively inactivate bacteria from wastewater and bioaerosols. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;spin electrocatalysis to boost 1O2 generation for disinfection process.

Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters own flexibly adjustable active sites and are promising functional drug carriers. In their Research Article (e202319700), Jiefei Wang, Bingyang Shi, Junwei Zhao et&#8197;al. designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) Ce3+/Ag+ co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster with blood brain barrier&#8208;traversing and mitochondrial targeting properties to solve the long&#8208;standing brain delivery problem of drugs for glioma. As the first brain&#8208;targeting POM drug, Ag+ specifically activates reactive oxygen species regulated apoptosis pathway of glioma and efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <dc:description>
An unexpected regiospecificity in topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization is reported by Kana&#8197;M. Sureshan et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202316513). Based on Schmidt's postulates for topochemical reactions, both the reactivity and the structure of the product were predicted. While the monomer packing predicted a regiospecific reaction to form a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, surprisingly, it formed an unexpected 1,5&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer as a result of massive molecular motion before the TEAC reaction.

         <title>Green Light Promoted Iridium(III)/Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Alkynes to Aziridinoquinoxalines Through the Intermediacy of Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalysts under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) photolysis (&#955;max=525&#8197;nm), is described. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations suggest a triplet energy transfer mechanism followed by a ring&#8208;opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates that are trapped with copper(I) acetylides.







Abstract
This manuscript describes the development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalytic system under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) photolysis (&#955;max=525&#8197;nm). This mild method features high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity and was used to generate 30 highly functionalized substituted dihydroquinoxalines in 36&#8211;98&#8201;% yield. This transformation was also carried asymmetrically using phthalazinamine&#8208;based chiral ligand to provide 9&#8197;chiral addition products in 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 86&#8201;:&#8201;14 e.r. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations of this reaction suggest a mechanism that involves Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed triplet energy transfer followed by a ring&#8208;opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates. These azomethine intermediates undergo sequential protonation/copper(I) acetylide addition to provide the products.

&lt;p&gt;The development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalysts under green light-emitting diode (LED) photolysis (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=525&#8197;nm), is described. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations suggest a triplet energy transfer mechanism followed by a ring-opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates that are trapped with copper(I) acetylides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manuscript describes the development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalytic system under green light-emitting diode (LED) photolysis (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=525&#8197;nm). This mild method features high levels of chemo- and regioselectivity and was used to generate 30 highly functionalized substituted dihydroquinoxalines in 36&#8211;98&#8201;% yield. This transformation was also carried asymmetrically using phthalazinamine-based chiral ligand to provide 9&#8197;chiral addition products in 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 86&#8201;:&#8201;14 e.r. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations of this reaction suggest a mechanism that involves Ir(III)-catalyzed triplet energy transfer followed by a ring-opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates. These azomethine intermediates undergo sequential protonation/copper(I) acetylide addition to provide the products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Reverse of Electrostatic Interaction Force for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy Al&#8208;Ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8722;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8722;. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge, which is a breakthrough for achieving ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density aluminum&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries by tuning surface charge of electrode materials.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes with sufficient interlayer spacing are promising cathode materials for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), yet the electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8722;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8722; and is usually ignored. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge. By doping N and Co, the zeta potential is gradually transformed from negative (Ti3C2Tx) to near&#8208;neutral (Ti3CNTx), and finally positive (Ti3CNTx@Co). Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion force can be greatly weakened between Ti3CNTx and AlCl4&#8722;, or even formed a strong electrostatic attraction between Ti3CNTx@Co and AlCl4&#8722;, which can not only accommodate more AlCl4&#8722; ions in the Ti3CNTx@Co interlayers to increase the capacity, but also solve the stacking and expansion problems. As a result, the optimized Al&#8208;MXene battery exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of up to 240&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4&#8197;times the capacity of graphite cathode, 60&#8211;120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a potential ultrahigh energy density (432&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, 2&#8211;4&#8197;times the value of graphite, 110&#8211;220&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) based on the mass of cathode materials, comparable to LiFePO4&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries (350&#8211;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the mass of LiFePO4).

         <title>Amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane&#8208;Enabled Electrophilic Amination of Arylboronic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes enable the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, including one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines.







Abstract
In this report, we describe the use of amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes in the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, including one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations indicate that the reaction proceeds through an electrophilic amination process from a tetravalent borate complex with a B&#8722;N dative bond.

         <title>Water&#8208;Degradable Oxygen&#8208;Rich Polymers with AB/ABB Units from Fast and Selective Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time report the copolymerization of formaldehyde and cyclic anhydride, which is fast and chemo&#8208;selective under mild conditions using common acids as catalysts. The versatile method yields a series of sustainable polymers with tunable AB/ABB units, which can be completely degraded into valuable diacids in water or seawater at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Researchers have been chasing plastics that can automatically and fully degrade into valuable products under natural conditions. Here, we develop a series of water&#8208;degradable polymers from the first reported fast and selective cationic copolymerization of formaldehyde (B) with cyclic anhydrides (A). In addition to readily accessible monomers, the method is performed at industrially relevant temperatures (~100&#8201;&#176;C), takes tens or even minutes, and uses common acid as the catalyst. Interestingly, such polymers possess tunable AB/ABB&#8208;type repeating units, which are considered to be thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively, resulting in low carbon content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 1&#8201;:&#8201;1). Notably, the polymers can completely degrade to valuable diacids within 150&#8197;days in water at ambient temperature owing to the incorporation of carboxyl terminals and acid&#8208;responsive acetal units. By washing with aqueous sodium carbonate, the polymers are relatively stable over several months.

         <title>Dynamically Modulating the Dissymmetry Factor of Circularly Polarized Organic Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Soft Helical Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an effective strategy for achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high dissymmetry factor based on a bilayered soft helical superstructure doped with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and room&#8208;temperature polymer layer. This enables the significant modulation of reflection across a wide spectral range and the dynamic controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP from 1.38 to 0.60.







Abstract
Achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high luminescent dissymmetry factor (glum) is crucial for diverse optoelectronic applications. In particular, dynamically controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP can profoundly advance these applications, but it is still unprecedented. This study introduces an effective strategy to achieve photoirradiation&#8208;driven chirality regulation in a bilayered structure film, which consists of a layer of soft helical superstructure incorporated with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and a layer of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer. The prepared bilayered film exhibits CP&#8208;OURTP with an emission lifetime of 805&#8197;ms and a glum value up to 1.38. Remarkably, the glum value of the resulting CP&#8208;OURTP film can be reversibly controlled between 0.6 and 1.38 over 20&#8197;cycles by light irradiation, representing the first example of dynamically controlling the glum in CP&#8208;OURTP.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Arylketone Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers has been realized. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products is showcased via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal difunctionalization of electro&#8208;rich arenes is achieved by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group.







Abstract
We report herein the development of palladium&#8208;catalyzed deacylative deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers. This protocol features excellent functional group tolerance, heterocyclic compatibility, and high deuterium incorporation levels. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products are showcased via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization (including fluorination, arylation, and alkylation) and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bond deuteration of electro&#8208;rich arenes are realized by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group, which is distinct from aryl halide in conventional dehalogenative deuteration.

         <title>Enantioselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homochiral Tetrahedral Cage Comprising Only Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, we introduced a chiral amine during the imine formation process. Addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde formed a trisimino intermediate. The chiral intermediate was then combined with achiral trisamino precursor. Imine exchange reaction led to release of the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 75&#8201;%, which is composed of achiral building precursors exclusively.







Abstract
How Nature synthesizes enantiomerically pure substances from achiral or racemic resources remains a mystery. In this study, we aimed to emulate this natural phenomenon by constructing chiral tetrahedral cages through self&#8208;assembly, achieved by condensing two achiral compounds&#8211;a trisamine and a trisaldehyde. The occurrence of intercomponent CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions among the phenyl building blocks within the cage frameworks results in twisted conformations, imparting planar chirality to the tetrahedrons. In instances where the trisaldehyde precursor features electron&#8208;withdrawing ester side chains, we observed that the intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces are strong enough to prevent racemization. To attain enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, a chiral amine was introduced during the imine formation process. The addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde precursor formed a trisimino intermediate. This chiral compound was subsequently combined with the achiral trisamino precursor, leading to an imine exchange reaction that releasing the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 75&#8201;%, exclusively composed of achiral building blocks. This experimental observation aligns with theoretical calculations based on the free energies of related cage structures. Moreover, since the chiral amine was not consumed during the imine exchange cycle, it enabled the enantioselective self&#8208;assembly of the tetrahedral cage for multiple cycles when new batches of the achiral trisaldehyde and trisamino precursors were successively added.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalysis: Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde Oxidation without Sacrifical Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that a two&#8208;hole oxidation process such as TEMPO catalyzed alcohol oxidation is a viable reaction to couple with reduction reaction to eliminate SED and generate two added&#8208;value chemicals in dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
There is a growing interest in developing dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) to produce molecular hydrogen (H2) as alternative energy source. To improve the sustainability of this technology, we replaced the sacrificial electron donor (SED), typically an expensive and polluting chemical, with an alcohol oxidation catalyst. This study demonstrates the first
dye&#8208;sensitized system using a diketopyrrolopyrrole dye covalently linked to 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) based catalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde transformation operating in water with visible irradiation.

         <title>Decoding Nanomaterial&#8208;Biosystem Interactions through Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and influenced by numerous entangled factors. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit these interactions. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode the interactions of nanomaterials with biosystems and provides some perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.







Abstract
The interactions between biosystems and nanomaterials regulate most of their theranostic and nanomedicine applications. These nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and influenced by a number of entangled factors, including but not limited to the physicochemical features of nanomaterials, the types and characteristics of the interacting biosystems, and the properties of the surrounding microenvironments. Over the years, different experimental approaches coupled with computational modeling have revealed important insights into these interactions, although many outstanding questions remain unanswered. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and to further push the boundary of this field. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and provides our perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Functional Small Molecules into Nanoparticles: Assembly and Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly approach is presented whereby a library of functional small molecules, encompassing anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores, are assembled into functional metal&#8211;phenolic network nanoparticles (FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under ambient conditions. These FSM&#8208;MPN NPs have potential use in a range of biological applications.







Abstract
Small molecules, including therapeutic drugs and tracer molecules, play a vital role in biological processing, disease treatment and diagnosis, and have inspired various nanobiotechnology approaches to realize their biological function, particularly in drug delivery. Desirable features of a delivery system for functional small molecules (FSMs) include high biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and simple manufacturing processes, without the need for chemical modification of the FSM itself. Herein, we report a simple and versatile approach, based on metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly, for assembling FSMs into nanoparticles (i.e., FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under aqueous and ambient conditions. We demonstrate loading of anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores at up to ~80&#8201;% that is mostly facilitated by &#960; and hydrophobic interactions between the FSM and nanoparticle components. Secondary nanoparticle engineering involving coating with a polyphenol&#8211;antibody thin film or sequential co&#8208;loading of multiple FSMs enables cancer cell targeting and combination delivery, respectively. Incorporating fluorophores into FSM&#8208;MPN NPs enables the visualization of biodistribution at different time points, revealing that most of these NPs are retained in the kidney and heart 24&#8197;h post intravenous administration. This work provides a viable pathway for the rational design of small molecule nanoparticle delivery platforms for diverse biological applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to obtain hydrogel with a topologically cross&#8208;linked structure has been developed by Yuichi Ohya et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202317045). Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. A water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure was synthesized. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, and the extending polymer chains&#160;penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.

         <title>Back Cover: Lateral Heterometal Junction Rectifier Fabricated by Sequential Transmetallation of Coordination Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forming lateral heterojunctions in two&#8208;dimensional materials enables taking full advantage of their attractive properties. In their Communication (e202318181), Hiroshi Nishihara et&#8197;al. report a novel method to fabricate a lateral heterojunction exhibiting rectifying properties by sequentially immersing a coordination nanosheet synthesized from zinc ions and benzenehexathiol into iron and copper salt solutions.

The butterfly metamorphosis: within the cocoon's shell (aryl methyl ethers) is encased a secret beauty (phenols), how to liberate it? In their Review (e202317257), Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes, and Bert&#8197;F. Sels et&#8197;al. comprehensively summarize the advancements and perspectives of lignin O&#8208;demethylation (metamorphosis). The presence of methoxy groups (cocoon) limits the chemical reactivity and the applicability of lignin&#8208;derived compounds. Through O&#8208;demethylation (metamorphosis), the reborn product (butterfly) rich in phenolic functionality can start a versatile new life with broader applications.

         <title>Fundamentals of Unanticipated Efficiency of Gd2O3&#8208;based Catalysts in Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic tests combined with temporal analysis of products revealed the fundamentals relevant for regulating the efficiency of the oxidative coupling of CH4 to C2H6 over Gd&#8208;based catalysts. When Gd2O3 is modified with Na, Sr or Ba, the use of N2O instead of O2 significantly improves the selectivity even at 650&#8201;&#176;C. The promoters affect the binding strength of monoatomic oxygen species derived from N2O and thus control the methane oxidation to carbon oxides.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane/ethylene poses a significant challenge for commercialization. The required improvements are hampered by the uncertainties associated with the reaction mechanism due to its complexity. Herein, we report about 90&#8201;% selectivity to the target products at 11&#8201;% methane conversion over Gd2O3&#8208;based catalysts at 700&#8201;&#176;C using N2O as the oxidant. Sophisticated kinetic studies have suggested the nature of adsorbed oxygen species and their binding strength as key parameters for undesired methane oxidation to carbon oxides. These descriptors can be controlled by a metal oxide promoter for Gd2O3.

         <title>Dipole Coupling Accelerated H2O Dissociation by Magnesium&#8208;Based Intermetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the d&#8208;band center is widely cited to predict the catalytic activity, the other factors, such as Coulomb interaction, have little been considered to design a catalyst for H2O&#8208;associated reactions. Using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we demonstrate the impact of dipole coupling on the H2O adsorption and dissociation processes.







Abstract
The water (H2O) dissociation is critical for various H2O&#8208;associated reactions, including water gas shift, hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrolysis corrosion. While the d&#8208;band center concept offers a catalyst design guideline for H2O activation, it cannot be applied to intermetallic or main group elements&#8208;based systems because Coulomb interaction was not considered. Herein, using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we illustrate the critical role of the dipole of the intermetallic catalysts for H2O dissociation. The H2O dissociation kinetics can be enhanced using MgxMey (Me=Co, Ni, Cu, Si and Al) as catalysts, and the hydrogen generation rate of Mg2Ni&#8208;loaded Mg reached 80&#8197;times as high as Ni&#8208;loaded Mg. The adsorbed H2O molecules strongly couple with the Mg&#8722;Me dipole of MgxMey, lowering the H2O dissociation barrier. The dipole&#8208;based H2O dissociation mechanism is applicable to non&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based systems, such as Mg2Si and Mg17Al12, offering a flexible catalyst design strategy for controllable H2O dissociation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene (NG) containing two octagons was synthesized via a regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure, where a double aza[7]helicene was simultaneously formed as an intermediate. Their saddle&#8208;shaped structures with negative curvature were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, enabling the exploration of structure&#8208;property relationship by photophysical, electrochemical and conformational studies. Moreover, the assembly of the octagon&#8208;embedded aza&#8208;NG with fullerenes was probed by fluorescence spectral titration, offering record&#8208;high binding constants (Ka = 9.5 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1 with C60, Ka = 3.7 &#215; 104 M&#8211;1 with C70) among reported negatively curved polycyclic aromatic compounds. The tight association of aza&#8208;NG with C60 was further elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of their co&#8208;crystal, showing the formation of 1:1 complex with substantial concave&#8208;convex interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Triplet Diffusion Facilitates Triplet Dissociation in a Pentacene Hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in covalent systems. We have developed a hexameric pentacene system, in which three pentacene dimers are covalently linked to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. This allows for an entropically driven triplet diffusion, resulting in higher yields of free triplets, and establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems.







Abstract
Triplet dynamics in singlet fission depend strongly on the strength of the electronic coupling. Covalent systems in solution offer precise control over such couplings. Nonetheless, efficient free triplet generation remains elusive in most systems, as the intermediate triplet pair 1(T1T1) is prone to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation due to its spatial confinement. In the solid state, entropically driven triplet diffusion assists in the spatial separation of triplets, resulting in higher yields of free triplets. Control over electronic coupling in the solid state is, however, challenging given its sensitivity to molecular packing. We have thus developed a hexameric system (HexPnc) to enable solid&#8208;state&#8208;like triplet diffusion at the molecular scale. This system is realized by covalently tethering three pentacene dimers to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. Transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical structural optimizations and steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, reveals that triplet diffusion is indeed facilitated due to intramolecular cluster formation. The yield of free triplets in HexPnc is increased by a factor of up to 14 compared to the corresponding dimeric reference (DiPnc). Thus, HexPnc establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems by providing avenues for diffusive separation of 1(T1T1), while, concomitantly, retaining strong interchromophore coupling which preserves rapid formation of 1(T1T1).

         <title>Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Aqueous Micellar Organometallic Catalysis: Methane Functionalization as a Case Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Dynamics have been applied to the study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic micellar system, in the first example of such investigations using a methane functionalization case.







Abstract
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations constitute a powerful tool that provides a 3D perspective of the dynamical behavior of chemical systems. Herein the first MD study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic system, in micellar media, is presented. The challenging methane catalytic functionalization into ethyl propionate through a silver&#8208;catalyzed process has been targeted as the case study. The intimate nature of the micelles formed with the surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been ascertained, as well as the relative distribution of the main actors in this transformation, namely methane, the diazo reagent and the silver catalyst, the latter in two different forms: the initial compound and a silver&#8208;carbene intermediate. Catalyst deactivation occurs with halide containing surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and Triton X&#8208;100. Computed simulations allow explaining the experimental results, indicating that micelles behave differently regarding the degree of accumulation and the local distribution of the reactants and their effect in the molecular collisions leading to net reaction.

         <title>Quantitative N&#8208; or C&#8208;Terminal Labelling of Proteins with Unactivated Peptides by Use of Sortases and a d&#8208;Aminopeptidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalised coupling strategy to enable quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unmodified peptides and readily produced catalysts is described. For C&#8208;terminal labelling, a small excess of the labelling peptide is required, but for N&#8208;terminal labelling, equimolar quantities of labelling reagents can be used to achieve quantitative labelling.







Abstract
Quantitative and selective labelling of proteins is widely used in both academic and industrial laboratories, and catalytic labelling of proteins using transpeptidases, such as sortases, has proved to be a popular strategy for such selective modification. A major challenge for this class of enzymes is that the majority of procedures require an excess of the labelling reagent or, alternatively, activated substrates rather than simple commercially sourced peptides. We report the use of a coupled enzyme strategy which enables quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unactivated labelling peptides. The use of an aminopeptidase in conjunction with a transpeptidase allows sequence&#8208;specific degradation of the peptide by&#8208;product, shifting the equilibrium to favor product formation, which greatly enhances the reaction efficiency. Subsequent optimisation of the reaction allows N&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using essentially equimolar ratios of peptide label to protein and C&#8208;terminal labelling with only a small excess. Minimizing the amount of substrate required for quantitative labelling has the potential to improve industrial processes and facilitate the use of transpeptidation as a method for protein labelling.

         <title>Engineered Glucose Oxidase&#8208;Carbon Nanotube Conjugates for Tissue&#8208;Translatable Glucose Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the development of nIR fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors for glucose imaging. The authors find that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the enzymatic activity but rather triggered by the substrate&#8208;enzyme binding. Leveraging this unique mechanism, the authors developed catalytically inactive nanosensors that enable glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.







Abstract
Continuous and non&#8208;invasive glucose monitoring and imaging is important for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. However, glucose monitoring remains a technical challenge owing to the dearth of tissue&#8208;transparent glucose sensors. In this study, we present the development of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors directly functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) capable of immediate and reversible glucose imaging in biological fluids and tissues. We prepared GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors by facile sonication of SWCNT with GOx in a manner that&#8212;surprisingly&#8212;does not compromise the ability of GOx to detect glucose. Importantly, we find by using denatured GOx that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the catalytic oxidation of glucose but rather triggered by glucose&#8208;GOx binding. Leveraging the unique response mechanism of GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors, we developed catalytically inactive apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT that enables both sensitive and reversible glucose imaging, exhibiting a &#916;F/F0 of up to 40&#8201;% within 1&#8197;s of exposure to glucose without consuming the glucose analyte. We finally demonstrate the potential applicability of apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT in biomedical applications by glucose quantification in human plasma and glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.

         <title>Ultrafast Surface&#8208;Specific Spectroscopy of Water at a Photoexcited TiO2 Model Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After UV excitation electrons and holes are generated at a timescale faster than 300&#8197;fs. The holes located at the surface subsequently mediate the deprotonation of interfacial water into Ti&#8722;OH species and of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. At both pH&#8197;3 and 11 this reaction occurs in less than 20&#8197;ps.







Abstract
A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole&#8208;mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular&#8208;level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time&#8208;resolved, surface&#8208;specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo&#8208;induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO2 in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub&#8208;20&#8197;ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH&#8197;3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H2O into Ti&#8722;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo&#8208;induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst&#8208;water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.

The holes located at the surface subsequently mediate the deprotonation of interfacial water into Ti&#8722;OH species and of pre-existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. At both pH&#8197;3 and 11 this reaction occurs in less than 20&#8197;ps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole-mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular-level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved, surface-specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo-induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub-20&#8197;ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH&#8197;3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into Ti&#8722;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre-existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo-induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst-water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalyst Supported by a Single&#8208;Atom Support Accelerates both Electrodes used in the Chlor&#8208;Alkali Industry via Modification of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a bridge between single&#8208;atom catalysts and organocatalysts, organic molecules anchored on single&#8208;atom supports exhibit high efficiency, durability, and bifunctional properties on both electrodes used in the chlor&#8208;alkali industry. This work not only provides an alternative choice for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but also provides a new platform to study the catalyst consisting of inorganic and organic species together, which performs well in both reduction and oxidation process.







Abstract
Consuming one of the largest amount of electricity, the chlor&#8208;alkali industry supplies basic chemicals for society, which mainly consists of two reactions, hydrogen evolution (HER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Till now, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst applied in this field is still the dimensional stable anode (DSA), which consumes a large amount of noble metal of Ru and Ir. It is thus necessary to develop new types of catalysts. In this study, an organocatalyst anchored on the single&#8208;atom support (SAS) is put forward. It exhibits high catalytic efficiency towards both HER and CER with an overpotential of 21&#8197;mV and 20&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With this catalyst on both electrodes, the energy consumption is cut down by 1.2&#8201;% compared with the commercial system under industrial conditions. Based on this novel catalyst and the high activity, the mechanism of modifying non&#8208;covalent interaction is demonstrated to be reliable for the catalyst's design. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but also points out that the SACs can also act as support, providing new twists for the development of SACs and organic molecules in the next step.

Abstract
There is a pressing need, particularly in the field of drug discovery, for general methods that will enable direct coupling of tertiary alkyl fragments to (hetero)aryl halides. Herein a uniquely powerful and simple set of conditions for achieving this transformation with unparalleled generality and chemoselectivity is disclosed. This new protocol is placed in context with other recently reported methods, applied to simplify the routes of known bioactive building blocks molecules, and scaled up in both batch and flow. The role of pyridine additive as well as the mechanism of this reaction are interrogated through Cyclic Voltammetry studies, titration experiments, control reactions with Ni(0) and Ni(II)&#8208;complexes, and ligand optimization data. Those studies indicate that the formation of a BINAPNi(0) is minimized and the formation of an active pyridine&#8208;stabilized Ni(I) species is sustained during the reaction. Our preliminary mechanistic studies ruled out the involvement of Ni(0) species in this electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling, which is mediated by Ni(I) species via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(III)&#8208;Ni(I) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Construction of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se Bonds from Unstrained Ketone Precursors under Photoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild photocatalytic deacylative strategy employing unstrained methyl ketones as radical precursors has been developed to construct sulfides, disulfides, selenides, sulfoxides and sulfones. Combining this deacylative process with SN2 or coupling reactions provides novel and convenient modular approaches toward unsymmetrical or symmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
A mild photoredox catalyzed construction of sulfides, disulfides, selenides, sulfoxides and sulfones from unstrained ketone precursors is introduced. Combination of this deacylative process with SN2 or coupling reactions provides novel and convenient modular strategies toward unsymmetrical or symmetric disulfides. Reactivity studies favor a bromine radical that initiates a HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) from the aminal intermediate resulting in expulsion of a C&#8208;centered radical that is intercepted to make C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bonds. Gram scale reactions, broad substrate scope and tolerance towards various functional groups render this method appealing for future applications in the synthesis of organosulfur and selenium complexes.

         <title>Optical Control of Proteasomal Protein Degradation with a Photoswitchable Lipopeptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable lipids are attached to a lipidated natural product, the potent proteasome inhibitor cepafungin I. The lead&#8208;compound PhotoCep4 exhibited a 10&#8208;fold higher cellular potency in its light&#8208;induced cis&#8208;form, matching the potency and proteome&#8208;wide modulation of constitutively active cepafungin I. This approach could be applicable to many other natural products as lipid conjugation is common and often necessary for potent activity.







Abstract
Photolipids have emerged as attractive tools for the optical control of lipid functions. They often contain an azobenzene photoswitch that imparts a cis double&#8208;bond upon irradiation. Herein, we present the application of photoswitching to a lipidated natural product, the potent proteasome inhibitor cepafungin I. Several azobenzene&#8208;containing lipids were attached to the cyclopeptide core, yielding photoswitchable derivatives. Most notably, PhotoCep4 exhibited a 10&#8208;fold higher cellular potency in its light&#8208;induced cis&#8208;form, matching the potency of natural cepafungin I. The length of the photolipid tail and distal positioning of the azobenzene photoswitch with respect to the macrocycle is critical for this activity. In a proteome&#8208;wide experiment, light&#8208;triggered PhotoCep4 modulation showed high overlap with constitutively active cepafungin I. The mode of action was studied using crystallography and revealed an identical binding of the cyclopeptide in comparison to cepafungin I, suggesting that differences in their cellular activity originate from switching the tail structure. The photopharmacological approach described herein could be applicable to many other natural products as lipid conjugation is common and often necessary for potent activity. Such lipids are often introduced late in synthetic routes, enabling facile chemical modifications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Benzils Achieved by Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization</title>

Chiral supramolecular polymerization provides a novel and effective approach for developing circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, which combines inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities with intense and color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized phosphorescent signals.







Abstract
In current approaches for circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, the crystallization of chiral phosphors suffers from poor processability, while integrating them into an amorphous polymer matrix results in unsatisfactory chiroptical signals due to the absence of chirality communication. Here, we have developed an innovative strategy through chiral supramolecular polymerization of benzil phosphors facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities of non&#8208;covalent supramolecular polymers obviate the need for an external polymer matrix. The pronounced helical asymmetry of benzil phosphors resulting from chiral supramolecular polymerization leads to enhanced circularly polarized phosphorescence compared to their non&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonded counterparts. The circularly polarized phosphorescent signals can be further modulated by varying the location of stereogenic centers or introducing halogen bonding to benzils. Incorporation of platinum(II) phosphor into the benzil supramolecular polymers induces both chirality and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, leading to a change in circularly polarized phosphorescent color from yellow to red. In summary, chiral supramolecular polymerization of phosphors represents a novel and effective approach to circularly polarized phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Assembly of Metalloporphyrins and Polyelectrolytes into Hierarchical Supramolecular Nanostructures for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the assembly of bilins in phycobilisome through the assistance of protein scaffold, hierarchical supramolecular nanostructures have been constructed by the co&#8208;assembly of artificial polyelectrolyte scaffolds and metalloporphyrins in water. This supramolecular assembly system resulted in a photocatalytic H2 production rate of&gt;51700&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 and a turnover number of 1299 per molecular catalyst over 24 h.







Abstract
Polypeptides, as natural polyelectrolytes, are assembled into tailored proteins to integrate chromophores and catalytic sites for photosynthesis. Mimicking nature to create the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies from synthetic polyelectrolytes and photocatalytic molecular species for artificial photosynthesis is still rare. Here, we report the enhancement of the full&#8208;spectrum solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production within a supramolecular system built by the co&#8208;assembly of anionic metalloporphyrins with cationic polyelectrolytes in water. This supramolecular photocatalytic system achieves a H2 production rate of 793 and 685&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 24&#8197;h with a combination of Mg or Zn porphyrin as photosensitizers and Cu porphyrin as a catalyst, which is more than 23&#8197;times higher than that of free molecular controls. With a photosensitizer to catalyst ratio of 10000&#8201;:&#8201;1, the highest H2 production rate of &gt;51,700&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a turnover number (TON) of &gt;1,290 per molecular catalyst was achieved over 24&#8197;h irradiation. The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly not only enhances photostability through forming ordered stackings of the metalloporphyrins but also facilitates both energy and electron transfer from antenna molecules to catalysts, and therefore promotes the photocatalysis. This study provides structural and mechanistic insights into the self&#8208;assembly enhanced photostability and catalytic performance of supramolecular photocatalytic systems.

         <title>A Microporous Poly(Arylene Ether) Platform for Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) with versatile synthetic tunability was synthesized via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O polycondensation. These PAEs can incorporate diverse functional groups and configurational designs. A PAE with a certain amount of branched linker exhibited excellent performance in CO2/CH4 mixed&#8208;gas membrane&#8208;based separations and can be fabricated into a submicron thin film to access high flux.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based gas separations are crucial for an energy&#8208;efficient future. However, it is difficult to develop membrane materials that are high&#8208;performing, scalable, and processable. Microporous organic polymers (MOPs) combine benefits for gas sieving and solution processability. Herein, we report membrane performance for a new family of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) synthesized via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling reactions. The scaffold of these microporous polymers consists of rigid three&#8208;dimensional triptycene and stereocontorted spirobifluorene, endowing these polymers with micropore dimensions attractive for gas separations. This robust PAE synthesis method allows for the facile incorporation of functionalities and branched linkers for control of permeation and mechanical properties. A solution&#8208;processable branched polymer was formed into a submicron film and characterized for permeance and selectivity, revealing lab data that rivals property sets of commercially available membranes already optimized for much thinner configurations. Moreover, the branching motif endows these materials with outstanding plasticization resistance, and their microporous structure and stability enables benefits from competitive sorption, increasing CO2/CH4 and (H2S+CO2)/CH4 selectivity in mixture tests as predicted by the dual&#8208;mode sorption model. The structural tunability, stability, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;processing suggest that this new platform of microporous polymers provides generalizable design strategies to form MOPs at scale for demanding gas separations in industry.

         <title>The Effect of Torsional Motion on Multiexciton Formation through Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Ferrocene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene(Fc)&#8208;terminated phenylene&#8208;bridged pentacene (Pc) dimers were synthesized to examine the effect of torsional motion on quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission. The optimized dimer exhibits an efficient 5TT yield together with quantitative singlet triplet pair (1TT) generation. The torsional motion in 1TT is ascribed to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc unit.







Abstract
A series of ferrocene(Fc)&#8208;bridged pentacene(Pc)&#8208;dimers [Fc&#8722;Ph(2,n)&#8722;(Pc)2: n=number of phenylene spacers] were synthesized to examine the tortional motion effect of Fc&#8208;terminated phenylene linkers on strongly coupled quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission (ISF). Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 has a relatively small electronic coupling and large conformational flexibility according to spectroscopic and theoretical analyses. Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 exhibits a high&#8208;yield 5TT together with quantitative singlet TT (1TT) generation through ISF. This demonstrates a much more efficient ISF than those of other less flexible Pc dimers. The activation entropy in 1TT spin conversion of Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 is larger than those of the other systems due to the larger conformational flexibility associated with the torsional motion of the linkers. The torsional motion of linkers in 1TT is attributable to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc due to hybridization of the hole level of Pc to Fc in 1TT unpaired orbitals.

         <title>&#8220;Whole&#8208;Body&#8221; Fluorination for Highly Efficient and Ultra&#8208;Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

To address the serious chemical instability induced by the inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening their interior bonding architecture. The F&#8722; ions distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal impart exceedingly strong ionic interaction with the QDs, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defect.







Abstract
Inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), triggered by the weak Pb&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) bond, is recognized as the primary culprit for their serious instability. A promising way is to construct exceedingly strong ionic interaction inside the QDs and increase their crystal cohesive energy by substituting the interior X&#8722; with highly electronegative F&#8722;, however, which is challenging and hitherto remains unreported. Here, a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening the interior bonding architecture of QDs, wherein the F&#8722; are uniformly distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal encompassing both the interior lattice and surface, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defects. This approach effectively mitigates their intrinsic instability issues including light&#8208;induced phase segregation. As a result, light&#8208;emitting devices based on these QDs exhibit exceptional efficiency and remarkable stability.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;bridging Nitrogen Coordination in Carbon&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal Oxygen Reduction</title>

A unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy was proposed to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble&#8208;metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging. Herein, we propose a unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources. The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon sites with four&#8208; (Zn&#8722;N4) and five&#8208;coordination (Fe&#8722;N5) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d10 electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal-nitrogen-carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble-metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging.

         <title>Strain&#8208;modulated Ru&#8208;O Covalency in Ru&#8208;Sn Oxide Enabling Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation in Acidic Solution</title>

Tensile strain applied to RuO6 octahedron optimizes the AEM reaction pathway and prohibits the LOM reaction pathway, leading to efficient and stable water oxidation in acidic solution.







Abstract
RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8722;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8722;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 and required merely 184&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 150&#8197;h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.

         <title>Effect of Alkali&#8208; and Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Promoters on Silica&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe Alloy for Autocatalytic CO2 Fixation</title>

         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;promoted Co&#8722;Fe bimetallic catalysts on silica can convert CO2 and H2O to crucial metabolites such as formate, acetate, pyruvate as well as hydrocarbons under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. With alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth metals abundant in hydrothermal vents, our study simulates how the geochemical process can fix CO2 before biochemical CO2 fixation would come into play.







Abstract
Hydrothermal vents harbor numerous microbial communities rich in reduced carbon species such as formate, acetate, and hydrocarbons. Such essential chemicals for life are produced by H2&#8208;dependent CO2 reduction, where serpentinization provides continuous H2 and thermal energy. Here, we show that silica&#8208;supported bimetallic Co&#8722;Fe alloys, naturally occurring minerals around serpentinite, can convert CO2 and H2O to key metabolic intermediates of the acetyl coenzyme A pathway such as formate (up to 72&#8197;mM), acetate, and pyruvate under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons up to C6 including propene are also detected, just as in the Lost City hydrothermal field. The effects of promoters on structural properties and catalytic functionalities of the Co&#8722;Fe alloy are systematically investigated by incorporating a series of alkali and alkaline earth metals including Na, Mg, K, and Ca. Alkali and alkaline earth metals resulted in higher formate concentrations when dissolved in water and increased reaction pH, while alkaline earth metals also favored the formation of insoluble hydroxides and carbonates similar to the constituent minerals of the chimneys at the Lost City hydrothermal fields.

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling to Prolong Exciton Lifetime of Nonfullerene Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuteration strategy is proposed to reduce molecular vibrational frequency and inhibit exciton&#8208;vibration coupling to decrease the non&#8208;radiative decay rate for prolonged exciton lifetime (&#964;). The deuterated L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D affords an excellent &#964; of 1.35&#8197;ns (the record for organic photovoltaic materials) to realize the improved LD of 10.7&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the prolonged LD, organic solar cells based on L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D achieve an impressive PCE of 19.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
The limited exciton lifetime (&#964;, generally &lt;1&#8197;ns) leads to short exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic semiconductors, which is the bottleneck issue impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, efficient strategies to prolong intrinsic &#964; are rare and vague. Herein, we propose a facile method to efficiently reduce vibrational frequency of molecular skeleton and suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling to decrease non&#8208;radiative decay rate and thus prolong &#964; via deuterating nonfullerene acceptors. The &#964; remarkably increases from 0.90&#8197;ns (non&#8208;deuterated L8&#8208;BO) to 1.35&#8197;ns (deuterated L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D), which is the record for organic photovoltaic materials. Besides, the inhibited molecular vibration improves molecular planarity of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D for enhanced exciton diffusion coefficient. Consequently, the LD increases from 7.9&#8197;nm (L8&#8208;BO) to 10.7&#8197;nm (L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D). The prolonged LD of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D enables PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D&#8208;based bulk heterojunction OSCs to acquire higher PCEs of 18.5&#8201;% with more efficient exciton dissociation and weaker charge carrier recombination than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based counterparts. Moreover, benefiting from the prolonged LD, D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D&#8208;based pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction OSCs achieve an impressive PCE of 19.3&#8201;%, which is among the highest values. This work provides an efficient strategy to increase the &#964; and thus LD of organic semiconductors, boosting PCEs of OSCs.

     alt="Suppressing Exciton-Vibration Coupling to Prolong Exciton Lifetime of Nonfullerene Acceptors Enables High-Efficiency Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteration strategy is proposed to reduce molecular vibrational frequency and inhibit exciton-vibration coupling to decrease the non-radiative decay rate for prolonged exciton lifetime (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;). The deuterated L8-BO-D affords an excellent &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; of 1.35&#8197;ns (the record for organic photovoltaic materials) to realize the improved &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 10.7&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the prolonged &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, organic solar cells based on L8-BO-D achieve an impressive PCE of 19.3&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited exciton lifetime (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;, generally &amp;lt;1&#8197;ns) leads to short exciton diffusion length (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) of organic semiconductors, which is the bottleneck issue impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, efficient strategies to prolong intrinsic &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; are rare and vague. Herein, we propose a facile method to efficiently reduce vibrational frequency of molecular skeleton and suppress exciton-vibration coupling to decrease non-radiative decay rate and thus prolong &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; via deuterating nonfullerene acceptors. The &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt; remarkably increases from 0.90&#8197;ns (non-deuterated L8-BO) to 1.35&#8197;ns (deuterated L8-BO-D), which is the record for organic photovoltaic materials. Besides, the inhibited molecular vibration improves molecular planarity of L8-BO-D for enhanced exciton diffusion coefficient. Consequently, the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; increases from 7.9&#8197;nm (L8-BO) to 10.7&#8197;nm (L8-BO-D). The prolonged &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of L8-BO-D enables PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO-D-based bulk heterojunction OSCs to acquire higher PCEs of 18.5&#8201;% with more efficient exciton dissociation and weaker charge carrier recombination than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO-based counterparts.

The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has been established via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation with uncommon regioselectivity in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity.







Abstract
In the chemistry community, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has proven to be a significant but challenging issue owing to the importance and difficulty in constructing such frameworks. In this work, we have realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation of achiral furan&#8208;indoles with 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols with uncommon regioselectivity. By this strategy, furan&#8208;indole compounds bearing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Moreover, theoretical calculations were conducted to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway, activation mode, and the origin of the selectivity.

         <title>Competitive Coordination Structure Regulation in Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A competitive coordination structure to form a unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster for stable zinc batteries is reported. The altered coordination leads to a robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;based batteries are finding their niche in energy storage applications where cost, safety, scalability matter, yet they are plagued by rapid performance degradation due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to stabilize Zn anode. Herein, we report a competitive coordination structure to form unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster. Unraveled by experiment and calculation results, the competing component can enter initial primary coordination shell of Zn2+ ion, partially substituting Lewis basic eutectic ligands and reinforcing cation&#8208;anion interaction. The hydration&#8208;deficient complexes induced between competing eutectic as hydrogen bond donor&#8208;accepter and water also broaden the electrochemical window and confine free water activity. The altered coordination further leads to robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth. Noticeably, stable Zn plating/stripping for 8000 cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies of 99.6&#8201;% and long cycling life of 10000 cycles for Zn&#8208;organic batteries are obtained. Even under harsh conditions (small N/P ratio, low temperature), the profits brought by the competitive eutectic electrolyte are still very prominent. This design principle leveraged by eutectic electrolytes with competitive coordination offers a new approach to improve battery performance.

         <title>Towards Optical Information Recording: A Robust Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Photoswitch with the Ring&#8208;Closure Reaction Yield Exceeding 96.3&#8201;%</title>

A novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven molecular switch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, was facilely synthesized by endcapping the photochromic dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. TPAP&#8722;DTE undergoes a quasi&#8208;quantitative ring&#8208;closure reaction with a yield &gt;96.3&#8201;% upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation. It remains robust even after 100&#8197;photoswitching cycles and 1000&#8208;hour aging test, and demonstrates versatility in optical information recording.







Abstract
Diarylethene molecular photoswitches hold great fascination as optical information materials due to their unique bistability and exceptional reversible photoswitching properties. Conventional diarylethenes, however, rely on UV light for ring&#8208;closure reactions, typically with modest yields. For practical application, diarylethenes driven by visible lights are preferred but achieving high ring&#8208;closure reaction yield remains a significant challenge. Herein, we synthesized a novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, by facilely endcapping the dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. Owing to the electron&#8208;donating conjugation effect of TPAP, the open&#8208;form TPAP&#8722;DTE responds strongly to short&#8208;wavelength visible lights with considerable photocyclization quantum yields and molar absorption coefficient. Upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation, TPAP&#8722;DTE achieves a ring&#8208;closure reaction yield exceeding 96.3&#8201;% (confirmed by both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography). Its ring&#8208;opening reaction yield is 100&#8201;% upon irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength visible light. TPAP&#8722;DTE could be regarded as a bidirectional &#8220;quasi&#8221;&#8208;quantitative conversion molecular switch. Furthermore, TPAP&#8722;DTE exhibits robust fatigue resistance over 100&#8197;full photoswitching cycles and great anti&#8208;aging property under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity for at least 1000&#8197;h. Consequently, its rewritable QR&#8208;code, multilevel data storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications are successfully demonstrated exclusively using visible lights, positioning TPAP&#8722;DTE as a highly promising medium for information recording.

A post&#8208;synthetic cascade resurfacing approach is developed for uniform indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which enables removal of native oxides, complete surface passivation, and electronic coupling among CQDs. Short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors fabricated using these resurfaced CQDs as the active layer achieve the highest EQE among III&#8211;V CQD photodetectors sensitive to 1400&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. Recent progress in the synthesis of indium antimonide (InSb) CQDs with sizes smaller than the Bohr exciton radius enables quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of the band gap. However, it has been challenging to achieve uniform InSb CQDs with band gaps below 0.9&#8197;eV, as well as to control the surface chemistry of these large&#8208;diameter CQDs. This has, to date, limited the development of InSb CQD photodetectors that are sensitive to 
1400&#8197;nm light. Here we adopt solvent engineering to facilitate a diffusion&#8208;limited growth regime, leading to uniform CQDs with a band gap of 0.89&#8197;eV. We then develop a CQD surface reconstruction strategy that employs a dicarboxylic acid to selectively remove the native In/Sb oxides, and enables a carboxylate&#8208;halide co&#8208;passivation with the subsequent halide ligand exchange. We find that this strategy reduces trap density by half compared to controls, and enables electronic coupling among CQDs. Photodetectors made using the tailored CQDs achieve an external quantum efficiency of 25&#8201;% at 1400&#8197;nm, the highest among III&#8211;V CQD photodetectors in this spectral region.

         <title>Discrimination of Disaccharide Isomers of Different Glycosidic Linkages Using a Modified MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MspA nanopore was applied to discriminate between disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages. An overall identification accuracy of 99&#8201;% was achieved, suggesting its potential use in the determination of glycosidic linkage and chemical analysis.







Abstract
Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide subunits joined by a glycosidic linkage in an &#945; or &#946; configuration. Different combinations of isomeric monosaccharide subunits and different glycosidic linkages result in different isomeric disaccharide products. Thus, direct discrimination of these disaccharide isomers from a mixture is extremely difficult. In this paper, a hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) nanopore conjugated with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adapter was applied for disaccharide sensing, with which three most widely known disaccharides in nature, including sucrose, lactose and maltose, were clearly discriminated. Besides, all six isomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;fructoses, differing only in their glycosidic linkages, were also well resolved. Assisted by a custom machine learning algorithm, a 0.99 discrimination accuracy is achieved. Nanopore discrimination of disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages, which has never been previously demonstrated, is inspiring for nanopore saccharide sequencing. This sensing capacity was also applied in direct identification of isomaltulose additives in a commercial sucrose&#8208;free yogurt, from which isomaltulose, lactose and L&#8208;lactic acid were simultaneously detected.

         <title>Fast Reaction Kinetics and Commendable Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability of Zinc Batteries Enabled by Aprotic Water&#8208;Acetamide Symbiotic Solvation Sheath</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild zinc fluoroborate&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte was developed by modifying the solvation sheath of Zn2+, leading to a more stable electrode/electrolyte interface and accelerated Zn2+ transfer kinetics. Joint participation in solvation process of water&#8208;acetamide&#8208;anions (Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2) significantly decreases the freezing point to &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C, extends the electrochemical stability window to 2.1&#8197;V and facilitates ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich inorganic/organic solid electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Although rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are cost effectiveness, intrinsicly safe, and high activity, they are also known for bringing rampant hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion. While eutectic electrolytes can effectively eliminate these issues, its high viscosity severely reduces the mobility of Zn2+ ions and exhibits poor temperature adaptability. Here, we infuse acetamide molecules with Lewis base and hydrogen bond donors into a solvated shell of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ to create Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2. The viscosity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is 0.032&#8197;Pa s, significantly lower than that of 1ace&#8208;0H2O (995.6&#8197;Pa s), which improves ionic conductivity (9.56&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and shows lower freezing point of &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C, as opposed to 1ace&#8208;0H2O of 4.04&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 12&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The acidity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is &#8776;2.8, higher than 0ace&#8208;1H2O at &#8776;0.76, making side reactions less likely. Furthermore, benefiting from the ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interface, the Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Zn cells cycle more than 1300&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Cu operated over 1800 cycles with an average Coulomb efficiency of &#8776;99.8&#8201;%. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;PANI cell cycled over 8500 cycles, with a specific capacity of 99.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and operated at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity of 66.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 to Light Olefins over ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13(100) shows light olefins selectivity up to 89.4&#8201;% with CO2 conversion of 9.1&#8201;%. A higher Si/Al ratio can suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation of light olefins to alkanes and lead to hydrocarbons with lower carbon number. Intermediates species generated from ZnZrOx migrate to the SSZ&#8208;13, and can be converted to hydrocarbons immediately.







Abstract
Converting CO2 to olefins is an ideal route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins, especially single&#8208;component olefin, while reducing CH4 formation remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13 tandem catalyst for the highly selective hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins. This catalyst shows C2=&#8722;C4= and propylene selectivity up to 89.4&#8201;% and 52&#8201;%, respectively, while CH4 is suppressed down to 2&#8201;%, and there is no obvious deactivation. It is demonstrated that the isolated moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of SSZ&#8208;13 promotes the rapid conversion of intermediate species derived from ZnZrOx, thereby enhancing the kinetic coupling of the reactions and inhibit the formation of alkanes and improve the light olefins selectivity. Besides, the weaker BAS of SSZ&#8208;13 promote the conversion of intermediates into aromatics with 4&#8211;6 methyl groups, which is conducive to the aromatics cycle. Accordingly, more propene can be obtained by elevating the Si/Al ratio of SSZ&#8208;13. This provides an efficient strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins with high selectivity.

         <title>Tandem Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster/MXene Electrocatalyst</title>

Silver nanoclusters loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) displays highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3RR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) provides a competitive manner for carbon neutrality and decentralized NH3 synthesis. Atomically precise nanoclusters, as an advantageous platform for investigating the NO3RR mechanisms and actual active sites, remain largely underexplored due to the poor stability. Herein, we report a (NH4)9[Ag9(mba)9] nanoclusters (Ag9 NCs) loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) for highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis with improved stability in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3. Besides, compared with individual Ag9 NCs, Ag9/MXene has better stability with the current density performed no decay after 108&#8197;hours of reaction. This work provides a strategy for improving the catalytic activity and stability of atomically precise metal NCs, expanding the mechanism research and application of metal NCs.

         <title>Negative Lattice Expansion in an O3&#8208;Type Transition&#8208;Metal Oxide Cathode for Highly Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An O3&#8208;type Ni&#8208;based layered oxide cathode material is designed to regulate the electron density of surrounding oxygen and trigger the intergrowth phase transition P3&#8594;OP2 for negative lattice expansion. It favors to alleviate the volume change and mitigate cracks generation, and hence renders excellent cycling performance in pouch&#8208;type sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The sodium extraction/insertion in layered transition&#8208;metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials are typically accompanied by slab sliding and lattice changes, leading to microstructure destruction and capacity decay. Herein, negative lattice expansion is observed in an O3 type Ni&#8208;based layered cathode of Na0.9Ni0.32Zn0.08Fe0.1Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 upon Na+ extraction. It is attributed to the weak Zn2+&#8722;O2&#8722; orbital hybridization and increased electron density of the surrounding oxygen for reinforced interlayer O&#8722;O repulsive force. This enables gliding of TMO slabs for the intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8594;OP2 to alleviate lattice strain with moderate lattice shrinkage, which exhibits general interslab spacings and volume changes as low as 2.4&#8201;% and 1.9&#8201;%, respectively. The strong Ti&#8722;O bonds accommodate the internal distortion of TMO6 octahedra due to the flexibility of TiO6 octahedra during cycling. These endow a high specific capacity of 144.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance of pouch&#8208;type sodium&#8208;ion batteries with 93&#8201;% capacity retention after 3600&#8197;cycles.

A solid&#8208;solution strategy is proposed to eliminate the impurity in Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 materials. The as&#8208;prepared pure&#8208;phase Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 exhibits enhanced specific capacity and cycling performance up to 14000 cycles. And a two&#8208;phase transition during Na+ extraction/insertion is distinctly revealed, thus providing new insights into both synthesis strategy and ion&#8208;storage mechanism of the promising Fe&#8208;based mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group compound.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group Fe&#8208;based phosphate materials, such as Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, have emerged as promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the synthesis of pure&#8208;phase material has remained a challenge, and the phase evolution during sodium (de)intercalation is debating as well. Herein, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is proposed to partition Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 into 2NaFePO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Na2FeP2O7 from the angle of molecular composition. Via regulating the starting ratio of NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 during the synthesis process, the nonstoichiometric pure&#8208;phase material could be successfully synthesized within a narrow NaFePO4 content between 1.6 and 1.2. Furthermore, the proposed synthesis strategy demonstrates strong applicability that helps to address the impurity issue of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 and nonstoichiometric Na3.4Co2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 are evidenced to be the pure phase. The model Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 cathode (the content of NaFePO4 equals&#8197;1.4) demonstrates exceptional sodium storage performances, including ultrahigh rate capability under 100&#8197;C and ultralong cycle life over 14000 cycles. Furthermore, combined measurements of ex situ nuclear magnetic resonance, in situ synchrotron radiation diffraction and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy clearly reveal a two&#8208;phase transition during Na+ extraction/insertion, which provides a new insight into the ionic storage process for such kind of mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group Fe&#8208;based phosphate materials and pave the way for the development of high&#8208;power sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Solvation Structure and Derived Interphase Tuning for High&#8208;Voltage Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium Metal Batteries with High Safety Using Gem&#8208;Difluorinated Ionic Liquid Based Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gem&#8208;difluorinated ionic liquid based dual&#8208;salt electrolyte has been developed for high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich lithium metal batteries with ultrahigh security and excellent battery performance benefiting from unique solvation structure and derived interphase.







Abstract
Stabilizing electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is crucial yet challenging, as they need to ensure stability against both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes (above 4.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+), addressing issues like poor cycling and thermal runaway. Herein, a novel gem&#8208;difluorinated skeleton of ionic liquid (IL) is designed and synthesized, and its non&#8208;flammable electrolytes successfully overcome aforementioned challenges. By creatively using dual salts, fluorinated ionic liquid and dimethyl carbonate as a co&#8208;solvent, the solvation structure of Li+ ions is efficiently controlled through electrostatic and weak interactions that are well unveiled and illuminated via nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.

     alt="Solvation Structure and Derived Interphase Tuning for High-Voltage Ni-Rich Lithium Metal Batteries with High Safety Using Gem-Difluorinated Ionic Liquid Based Dual-Salt Electrolytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel gem-difluorinated ionic liquid based dual-salt electrolyte has been developed for high-voltage Ni-rich lithium metal batteries with ultrahigh security and excellent battery performance benefiting from unique solvation structure and derived interphase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stabilizing electrolytes for high-voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is crucial yet challenging, as they need to ensure stability against both Li anodes and high-voltage cathodes (above 4.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), addressing issues like poor cycling and thermal runaway. Herein, a novel gem-difluorinated skeleton of ionic liquid (IL) is designed and synthesized, and its non-flammable electrolytes successfully overcome aforementioned challenges. By creatively using dual salts, fluorinated ionic liquid and dimethyl carbonate as a co-solvent, the solvation structure of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is efficiently controlled through electrostatic and weak interactions that are well unveiled and illuminated via nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The as-prepared electrolytes exhibit high security avoiding thermal runaway and show excellent compatibility with high-voltage cathodes. Besides, the solvation structure derives a robust and stable F-rich interphase, resulting in high reversibility and Li-dendrite prevention. LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li LMBs (4.5&#8197;V) demonstrate excellent long-term stability with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of at least 99.99&#8201;% and a good capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% over 300 cycles, even can work at a higher voltage of 4.7&#8197;V. Furthermore, the ultrahigh Ni-rich LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li system also delivers excellent electrochemical performance, highlighting the significance of fluorinated IL-based electrolyte design and enhanced interphasial chemistry in improving battery performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polydentate Ligand Reinforced Chelating to Stabilize Buried Interface toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy is proposed to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The BTP&#8208;modified device achieves a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63&#8201;%. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;% of their initial PCE values after over 3000&#8197;h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728&#8197;h of thermal stress, respectively.







Abstract
The instability of the buried interface poses a serious challenge for commercializing perovskite photovoltaic technology. Herein, we report a polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl)phosphonate (BTP) is employed to manipulate the buried interface. The C=O, P=O and two &#8722;CF3 functional groups in BTP synergistically passivate the defects from the surface of SnO2 and the bottom surface of the perovskite layer. Moreover, The BTP modification contributes to mitigated interfacial residual tensile stress, promoted perovskite crystallization, and reduced interfacial energy barrier. The multidentate ligand modulation strategy is appropriate for different perovskite compositions. Due to much reduced nonradiative recombination and heightened interface contact, the device with BTP yields a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies ever reported for devices fabricated in the air environment. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;% of their initial PCE values after over 3000&#8197;h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728&#8197;h of thermal stress, respectively. This work provides insights into strengthening the stability of the buried interface by engineering multidentate chelating ligand molecules.

         <title>Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.







Abstract
The implementation of supported metal catalysts heavily relies on the synergistic interactions between metal nanoparticles and the material they are dispersed on. It is clear that interfacial perimeter sites have outstanding skills for turning catalytic reactions over, however, high activity and selectivity of the designed interface&#8208;induced metal distortion can also obtain catalysts for the most crucial industrial processes as evidenced in this paper. Herein, the beneficial synergy established between designed Pt nanoparticles and MnO in the course of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction resulted in a Pt/MnO catalyst having &#8776;10&#8197;times higher activity compared to the reference Pt/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst with &gt;99&#8201;% CO selectivity. Under activation, a crystal assembly through the metallic Pt (110) and MnO evolved, where the plane distance differences caused a mismatched&#8208;row structure in softer Pt nanoparticles, which was identified by microscopic and surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic characterizations combined with density functional theory simulations. The generated edge dislocations caused the Pt lattice expansion which led to the weakening of the Pt&#8722;CO bond. Even though MnO also exhibited an adverse effect on Pt by lowering the number of exposed metal sites, rapid desorption of the linearly adsorbed CO species governed the performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS.

         <title>Single Zn Atoms with Acetate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Enabled Asymmetric Coordination for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acetate&#8208;anion&#8208;directed approach is developed to create asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3O moiety on polymeric carbon nitride (CN/Zn&#8722;OAc) using zinc acetate. The asymmetric coordination modulates the electronic structure of Zn centers, thus facilitating O2 adsorption and the subsequent generation of the key intermediate *OOH. As a result, CN/Zn&#8722;OAc exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Exploring unique single&#8208;atom sites capable of efficiently reducing O2 to H2O2 while being inert to H2O2 decomposition under light conditions is significant for H2O2 photosynthesis, but it remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile design and fabrication of polymeric carbon nitride (CN) decorated with single&#8208;Zn sites that have tailorable local coordination environments, which is enabled by utilizing different Zn salt anions. Specifically, the O atom from acetate (OAc) anion participates in the coordination of single&#8208;Zn sites on CN, forming asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3O moiety on CN (denoted as CN/Zn&#8722;OAc), in contrast to the obtained Zn&#8722;N4 sites when sulfate (SO4) is adopted (CN/Zn&#8722;SO4). Both experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Zn&#8722;N3O moiety exhibits higher intrinsic activity for O2 reduction to H2O2 than the Zn&#8722;N4 moiety. This is attributed to the asymmetric N/O coordination, which promotes the adsorption of O2 and the formation of the key intermediate *OOH on Zn sites due to their modulated electronic structure. Moreover, it is inactive for H2O2 decomposition under both dark and light conditions. As a result, the optimized CN/Zn&#8722;OAc catalyst exhibits significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Polyethylene Upgrading to Liquid Fuels Boosted by Atomic Ce Promoters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a significantly&#8208;promoted low&#8208;density polyethylene upgrading process with a high selectivity of liquid fuels by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts. The Ce species in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates, thus contributing to the accelerated rate of second&#8208;round C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract

         <title>Dynamic Ultra&#8208;long Room Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled by Amorphous Molecular &#8220;Triplet Exciton Pump&#8221; for Encryption with Temporospatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal amorphous molecular host (DPOBP&#8722;Br) was designed by merging an amorphous moiety and an intersystem crossing (ISC) unit. As a &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221;, DPOBP&#8722;Br endows various commercial fluorescent dyes with colorful dynamic RTP in their amorphous host&#8211;guest films. Thus, amorphous coatings on even curved surfaces were successfully achieved, with 2D&#8208;time&#8208; and spatial&#8208; dependent RTP for advanced information encryption.







Abstract
Organic ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials in the amorphous state have attracted widespread attention due to their simple preparation and flexibility to adopt various forms in sensors, bioimaging, and encryption applications. However, the amorphous molecular host for the host&#8211;guest RTP systems is highly demanded but limited. Here, a universal molecular host (DPOBP&#8722;Br) has been designed by integration of an amorphous moiety of diphenylphosphine oxide (DPO) and an intersystem crossing (ISC) group of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;benzophenone (BP&#8722;Br). Various commercial fluorescence dyes were doped into the tight and transparent DPOBP&#8722;Br film, respectively, resulting in amorphous host&#8211;guest systems with ultra&#8208;long RTP colors from green to red. It was found that DPOBP&#8722;Br acted as a universal &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221; for promoting the generation of triplet excitons in the guest, through energy transfer processes and external heavy&#8208;atom effect based on DPOBP&#8722;Br. Interestingly, dynamic RTP was achieved by controlling residual oxygen concentration in the amorphous matrix by UV irradiation. Therefore, multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting coatings were realized even on curved surfaces, simultaneously exhibiting spatial and 2D&#8208;time dependence. This work provides a strategy to design new amorphous molecular hosts for RTP systems and demonstrates the advanced information encryption with tempo&#8208;spatial resolution based on the dynamic ultra&#8208;long RTP of an amorphous system.

In this study, a functionally alterable antioxidant molecule, DBHQ, is developed and introduced into Sn&#8722;Pb mixed perovskite films by an anti&#8208;solvent method, which can achieve simultaneous antioxidant and defect passivation.







Abstract
Inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ during the crystallization process of Sn&#8722;Pb mixed perovskite film is found to be as important as the oxidation resistance of precursor solution to achieve high efficiency, but less investigated. Considering the excellent reduction feature of hydroquinone and the hydrophobicity of tert&#8208;butyl group, an antioxidant 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ) was introduced into Sn&#8722;Pb mixed perovskite films using an anti&#8208;solvent approach to solve this problem. Interestingly, we find that DBHQ can act as function alterable additive during its utilization. On the one hand, DBHQ can restrict the oxidation of Sn2+ during the crystallization process, facilitating the fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite film; on the other hand, the generated oxidation product 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DBBQ) can functionalize as defect passivator to inhibit the charge recombination. As a result, this synergetic effect renders the Sn&#8722;Pb mixed PSC a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 23.0&#8201;%, which is significantly higher than the reference device (19.6&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated DBQH&#8208;modified PSCs exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability and thermal stability, with the devices maintaining 84.2&#8201;% and 78.9&#8201;% of the initial PCEs after aging at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C for 800&#8197;h and 120&#8197;h under N2 atmosphere, respectively. Therefore, the functional alterable strategy provides a novel cornerstone for high&#8208;performance Sn&#8722;Pb mixed PSCs.

         <title>Chaotropic Nanoelectrocatalysis: Chemically Disrupting Water Intermolecular Network at the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Catalysis to Boost Green Hydrogen Electrosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Chaotropic electrocatalyst chemically disrupts water intermolecular networks at the point&#8208;of&#8208;catalysis to release free/weakly bound water, promoting intimate catalyst&#8208;reactant interactions and proton discharge processes for efficient green hydrogen production. Our molecule&#8208;electrocatalyst design demonstrates 2&#8208;fold and 3&#8208;fold better Tafel slope and overpotential when compared to its kosmotropic counterparts and emerging electrocatalytic designs.







Abstract
Efficient green hydrogen production through electrocatalytic water splitting serves as a powerful catalyst for realizing a carbon&#8208;free hydrogen economy. However, current electrocatalytic designs face challenges such as poor hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (Tafel slope, 100&#8211;140&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) because water molecules are thermodynamically trapped within their extensive hydrogen bonding network. Herein, we drive efficient HER by manipulating the local water microenvironment near the electrocatalyst. This is achieved by functionalizing the nanoelectrocatalyst's surface with a monolayer of chaotropic molecules to chemically weaken water&#8208;water interactions directly at the point&#8208;of&#8208;catalysis. Notably, our chaotropic design demonstrates a superior Tafel slope (77&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and the lowest overpotential (0.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2ECSA), surpassing its kosmotropic counterparts (which reinforces the water molecular network) and previously reported electrocatalytic designs by up to &#8776;2&#8208;fold and &#8776;3&#8208;fold, respectively. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations highlight the critical role of chaotropic surface chemistry in disrupting the water intermolecular network, thereby releasing free/weakly bound water molecules that strongly interact with the electrocatalyst to boost HER. Our study provides a unique molecular approach that can be readily integrated with emerging electrocatalytic materials to rapidly advance the electrosynthesis of green hydrogen, holding immense promise for sustainable chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Stabilizing *CO2 Intermediates at the Acidic Interface using Molecularly Dispersed Cobalt Phthalocyanine as Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Without the assistance of metal cations, CoPc@CNT itself stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface, and thus enables CO2 conversion in pure acid, even at pH=1. As for Au/Ag, CO2 adsorption step is completely suppressed by the high coverage of H, causing only hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.







Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) operating in acidic media circumvents the problems of carbonate formation and CO2 crossover in neutral/alkaline electrolyzers. Alkali cations have been universally recognized as indispensable components for acidic CO2R, while they cause the inevitable issue of salt precipitation. It is therefore desirable to realize alkali&#8208;cation&#8208;free CO2R in pure acid. However, without alkali cations, stabilizing *CO2 intermediates by catalyst itself at the acidic interface poses as a challenge. Herein, we first demonstrate that a carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc@CNT) catalyst provides the Co single&#8208;atom active site with energetically localized d states to strengthen the adsorbate&#8208;surface interactions, which stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface (pH=1). As a result, we realize CO2 conversion to CO in pure acid with a faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% at pH=2 in flow cell. Furthermore, CO2 is successfully converted in cation exchanged membrane&#8208;based electrode assembly with a faradaic efficiency of 73&#8201;%. For CoPc@CNT, acidic conditions also promote the intrinsic activity of CO2R compared to alkaline conditions, since the potential&#8208;limiting step, *CO2 to *COOH, is pH&#8208;dependent. This work provides a new understanding for the stabilization of reaction intermediates and facilitates the designs of catalysts and devices for acidic CO2R.

     alt="Stabilizing *CO2 Intermediates at the Acidic Interface using Molecularly Dispersed Cobalt Phthalocyanine as Catalysts for CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the assistance of metal cations, CoPc@CNT itself stabilizes *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates at the acidic interface, and thus enables CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion in pure acid, even at pH=1. As for Au/Ag, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption step is completely suppressed by the high coverage of H, causing only hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) operating in acidic media circumvents the problems of carbonate formation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crossover in neutral/alkaline electrolyzers. Alkali cations have been universally recognized as indispensable components for acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, while they cause the inevitable issue of salt precipitation. It is therefore desirable to realize alkali-cation-free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R in pure acid. However, without alkali cations, stabilizing *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates by catalyst itself at the acidic interface poses as a challenge. Herein, we first demonstrate that a carbon nanotube-supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc@CNT) catalyst provides the Co single-atom active site with energetically localized &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; states to strengthen the adsorbate-surface interactions, which stabilizes *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates at the acidic interface (pH=1). As a result, we realize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to CO in pure acid with a faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% at pH=2 in flow cell. Furthermore, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is successfully converted in cation exchanged membrane-based electrode assembly with a faradaic efficiency of 73&#8201;%.

         <title>Regioselective Dearomative Amidoximation of Nonactivated Arenes Enabled by Photohomolytic Cleavage of N&#8208;nitrosamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is a novel method to realize a highly regioselective dearomative difunctionalization for the synthesis of various spirocycles. The nonredox homolysis, the reversible radical coupling, and the nitroso&#8208;oxime tautomerism promote the chemoselectivity of dearomative 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;amidoximation.







Abstract
Dearomative spirocyclization reactions represent a promising means to convert arenes into three&#8208;dimensional architectures; however, controlling the regioselectivity of radical dearomatization with nonactivated arenes to afford the spirocyclizative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization other than its kinetically preferred 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization is exceptionally challenging. Here we disclose a novel strategy for dearomative 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;amidoximation of (hetero)arenes enabled by direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis of N&#8722;NO bonds of nitrosamides, giving rise to various highly regioselective amidoximated spirocycles that previously have been inaccessible or required elaborate synthetic efforts. The mechanism and origins of the observed regioselectivities were investigated by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Hydrophobic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Si Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized poly(ionic liquid)s to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network that passivates the wide&#8208;band gap perovskite/electron transport layer interface and inhibits ion migration. The optimized devices achieve impressive efficiencies with outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. The textured perovskite/Si tandem cell also reaches a remarkable champion efficiency maintaining exceptional operational stability.







Abstract
The pursuit of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices, is a key focus in achieving the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. In this study, we initially designed poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) with varying alkyl chain lengths based on density functional theory calculations. Results pinpoint that PILs with longer alkyl chain lengths tend to exhibit more robust binding energy with the perovskite structure. Then we synthesized the PILs to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network (HHPN) that passivates the WBG perovskite/electron transport layer interface, inhibits ion migration and serves as a barrier layer against water and oxygen ingression. Accordingly, the HHPN effectively curbs nonradiative recombination losses while facilitating efficient carrier transport, resulting in substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor. As a result, the optimized single&#8208;junction WBG PSC achieves an impressive efficiency of 23.18&#8201;%, with Voc as high as 1.25&#8197;V, which is the highest reported for WBG (over 1.67&#8197;eV) PSCs. These devices also demonstrate outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. Notably, this versatile strategy can be extended to textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 28.24&#8201;% while maintaining exceptional operational stability.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Perylene Diimide Polymers with a Robust Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
Three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers were designed and synthesized such that the molecular orientation of the PDI units was regulated to create and modulate their built&#8208;in electric fields. Due to the large dipole moment and interfacial electric field, oPDI enables an extraordinary photocurrent density of 115.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 11.5 and 26.8&#8197;times that of mPDI and pPDI, respectively.







Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field of the polymer semiconductors could be regulated by the dipole moment of its building blocks, thereby promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieving efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting. Herein, three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers, namely oPDI, mPDI and pPDI, are synthesized with different phenylenediamine linkers. Notably, the energy level structure, light&#8208;harvesting efficiency, and photogenerated carrier separation and migration of polymers are regulated by the orientation of PDI unit. Among them, oPDI enables a large dipole moment and robust built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in enhanced solar&#8208;driven water splitting performance. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, oPDI exhibits the highest photocurrent of 115.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution, which is 11.5&#8197;times that of mPDI, 26.8&#8197;times that of pPDI and 104.6&#8197;times that of its counterparts PDI monomer at the same conditions. This work provides a strategy for designing polymers by regulating the orientation of structural units to construct efficient solar energy conversion systems.

         <title>How the Length of Through&#8208;Space Conjugation Influences the Clusteroluminescence of Oligo(Phenylene Methylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work quantitatively reveals the relationship between the non&#8208;conjugated chain length and strength of through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) and constructs the cornerstone of TSC&#8208;based photophysical theory.







Abstract
The length and mode of conjugation directly affect the molecular electronic structure, which has been extensively studied in through&#8208;bond conjugation (TBC) systems. Corresponding research greatly promotes the development of TBC&#8208;based luminophores. However, how the length and mode of through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC), one kind of weak interaction, influence the photophysical properties of non&#8208;conjugated luminophores remains a relatively unexplored field. Here, we unveil a non&#8208;linear relationship between TSC length and emission characteristics in non&#8208;conjugated systems, in contrast to the reported proportional correlation in TBC systems. More specifically, oligo(phenylene methylene)s (OPM[4]&#8208;OPM[7]) exhibit stronger TSC and prominent blue clusteroluminescence (CL) (&#8776;440&#8197;nm) compared to shorter counterparts (OPM[2] and OPM[3]). OPM[6] demonstrates the highest solid&#8208;state quantum yield (40&#8201;%), emphasizing the importance of balancing flexibility and rigidity. Further theoretical calculations confirmed that CL of these oligo(phenylene methylene)s was determined by stable TSC derived from the inner rigid Diphenylmethane (DPM) segments within the oligomers instead of the outer ones. This discovery challenges previous assumptions and adds a new dimension to the understanding of TSC&#8208;based luminophores in non&#8208;conjugated systems.

More specifically, oligo(phenylene methylene)s (OPM[4]-OPM[7]) exhibit stronger TSC and prominent blue clusteroluminescence (CL) (&#8776;440&#8197;nm) compared to shorter counterparts (OPM[2] and OPM[3]). OPM[6] demonstrates the highest solid-state quantum yield (40&#8201;%), emphasizing the importance of balancing flexibility and rigidity. Further theoretical calculations confirmed that CL of these oligo(phenylene methylene)s was determined by stable TSC derived from the inner rigid Diphenylmethane (DPM) segments within the oligomers instead of the outer ones. This discovery challenges previous assumptions and adds a new dimension to the understanding of TSC-based luminophores in non-conjugated systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembly and Utility of a Drawstring&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drawstring&#8208;mimetic supramolecular complex has been developed via assembly between a rigid dual&#8208;cavity macrocyclic host (molecular cord lock) and a flexible linear guest (molecular thread). In addition to structural resemblance, the complex also mimics drawstring's deformations induced by external forces, and can be used as an interlocked crosslinker in polymer samples for comprehensive enhancement of macroscopic mechanical properties.







Abstract
Inspired by the drawstring structure in daily life, here we report the development of a drawstring&#8208;mimetic supramolecular complex at the molecular scale. This complex consists of a rigid figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocyclic host molecule and a flexible linear guest molecule which could interact through three&#8208;point non&#8208;covalent binding to form a highly selective and efficient host&#8208;guest assembly. The complex not only resembles the drawstring structure, but also mimics the properties of a drawstring with regard to deformations under external forces. The supramolecular drawstring can be utilized as an interlocked crosslinker for poly(methyl acrylate), and the corresponding polymer samples exhibit comprehensive enhancement of macroscopic mechanical performance including stiffness, strength, and toughness.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Degradation of Ergothioneine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ergothioneine is a ubiquitous sulfur&#8208;containing natural product. A dioxygenase and a desulfinase were found to mediate oxidative degradation of ergothioneine in actinobacteria.







Abstract
Ergothioneine is a sulfur&#8208;containing metabolite that is produced by bacteria and fungi, and is absorbed by plants and animals as a micronutrient. Ergothioneine reacts with harmful oxidants, including singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and may therefore protect cells against oxidative stress. Herein we describe two enzymes from actinobacteria that cooperate in the specific oxidative degradation of ergothioneine. The first enzyme is an iron&#8208;dependent thiol dioxygenase that produces ergothioneine sulfinic acid. A crystal structure of ergothioneine dioxygenase from Thermocatellispora tengchongensis reveals many similarities with cysteine dioxygenases, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common mechanism. The second enzyme is a metal&#8208;dependent ergothioneine sulfinic acid desulfinase that produces N&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine and SO2. The discovery that certain actinobacteria contain the enzymatic machinery for O2&#8208;dependent biosynthesis and O2&#8208;dependent degradation of ergothioneine indicates that these organisms may actively manage their ergothioneine content.

         <title>All&#8208;Round Ionic Liquids for Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile ionic liquid, EMIM[OAc], is employed for synchronous optimization of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries. The solvation structure involving OAc&#8722; and the EMIM+&#8208;induced IHP can suppress Zn anode corrosion. And EMIM+ is effective in inhibiting iodine dissolution and capturing polyiodides, thereby significantly mitigating shuttle effects.







Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) is hindered by the rampant Zn dendrites growth, parasite corrosion, and polyiodide shuttling. In this work, ionic liquid EMIM[OAc] is employed as an all&#8208;round solution to mitigate challenges on both the Zn anode and the iodine cathode side. First, the EMIM+ embedded lean&#8208;water inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and inert solvation sheath modulated by OAc&#8722; effectively repels H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. The preferential adsorption of EMIM+ on Zn metal facilitates uniform Zn nucleation via a steric hindrance effect. Second, EMIM+ can reduce the polyiodide shuttling by hindering the iodine dissolution and forming an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; dominated phase. These effects holistically enhance the cycle life, which is manifested by both Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Zn symmetric cells and Zn&#8208;I2 full cells. ZIBs with EAc deliver a capacity decay rate of merely 0.01 &#8240; per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and lower self&#8208;discharge and better calendar life than the ZIBs without ionic liquid EAc additive.

         <title>Hydrophilic Cocrystals with Water Switched Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic donors with electron&#8208;deficient acceptors were coassembled to achieve luminescence&#8208;switching cocrystals triggered by water molecules. The obtained cocrystals show a strong water absorption ability and excellent fluorescence properties. The emission of cocrystals can be reversibly switched by heating and water. Finally, the obtained cocrystals show potential applications in temperature&#8208;humidity and acid&#8208;base responses.







Abstract
Utilizing water molecules to regulate the luminescence properties of solid materials is highly challenging. Herein, we develop a strategy to produce water&#8208;triggered luminescence&#8208;switching cocrystals by coassembling hydrophilic donors with electron&#8208;deficient acceptors, where 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was used as the electron acceptor and pyridyl benzimidazole derivatives were used as the electron donors enabling multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds. Two cocrystals, namely 2PYTC and 4PYTC were obtained and showed heat&#8208;activated emission, and such emission could be quenched or weakened by adding water molecules. The cocrystal structure exhibited the donor molecule that can form multiple hydro bonds with water and acceptor molecules due to the many nitrogen atoms of them. The analyses of the photophysical data, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and other data confirmed the reversible fluorescence &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; effects were caused by eliminating and adding water molecules in the crystal lattice. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the vibration of the O&#8208;H bond of water molecules in the cocrystal can absorb the excitation energy and suppress fluorescence. Furthermore, the obtained cocrystals also showed temperature, humidity, and H+/NH4+ responsive emission behavior, which allows their applications as thermal and humidity sensors, and multiple information encryptions. This research paves the way for preparing intelligent hydrophilic organic cocrystal luminescent materials.

         <title>Bidirectional Regulation of Intracellular Enzyme Activity Using Light&#8208;Driven Nano&#8208;Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;inhibitor (NIn) captures the target enzyme via non&#8208;covalent interactions and regulates its enzyme activity in a light&#8208;controlled manner. Specifically, the body of NIn recognizes and binds to the targeted enzyme. The arm of NIn generates a push&#8208;pull motion when irradiated with UV and Vis light, resulting in docking and undocking of the inhibitor at the enzyme active site.







Abstract
Photochemical regulation provides precise control over enzyme activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. A promising approach involves anchoring &#8220;photoswitches&#8221; at enzyme active sites to modulate substrate recognition. However, current methods often require genetic mutations and irreversible enzyme modifications for the site&#8208;specific anchoring of &#8220;photoswitches&#8221;, potentially compromising the enzyme activities. Herein, we present a pioneering reversible nano&#8208;inhibitor based on molecular imprinting technique for bidirectional regulation of intracellular enzyme activity. The nano&#8208;inhibitor employs a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticle as its body and azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors (&#8220;photoswitches&#8221;) as the arms. By using a target enzyme as the molecular template, the nano&#8208;inhibitor acquires oriented binding sites on its surface, resulting in a high affinity for the target enzyme and non&#8208;covalently firm anchoring of the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the enzyme active site. Harnessing the reversible isomerization of azobenzene units upon exposure to ultraviolet and visible light, the nano&#8208;inhibitor achieves bidirectional enzyme activity regulation by precisely docking and undocking inhibitor at the active site. Notably, this innovative approach enables the facile in situ regulation of intracellular endogenous enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Our results represent a practical and versatile tool for precise enzyme activity regulation in complex intracellular environments.

&lt;p&gt;Nano-inhibitor (NIn) captures the target enzyme via non-covalent interactions and regulates its enzyme activity in a light-controlled manner. Specifically, the body of NIn recognizes and binds to the targeted enzyme. The arm of NIn generates a push-pull motion when irradiated with UV and Vis light, resulting in docking and undocking of the inhibitor at the enzyme active site.

         <title>Wingtip&#8208;Flexible N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Unsymmetrical Connection between IMes and IPr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands that are characterized by freely&#8208;rotatable N&#8208;aromatic wingtips in the imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene architecture. The combination of a rotatable N&#8722;CH2Ar bond with the conformationally&#8208;fixed N&#8722;Ar linkage results in a highly modular ligand topology, entering the range of geometries inaccessible to IMes and IPr.







Abstract
IMes (IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and IPr (IPr=1,3&#8208; bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) represent by far the most frequently used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands in homogeneous catalysis, however, despite numerous advantages, these ligands are limited by the lack of steric flexibility of catalytic pockets. We report a new class of unique unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands that are characterized by freely&#8208;rotatable N&#8208;aromatic wingtips in the imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene architecture. The combination of rotatable N&#8722;CH2Ar bond with conformationally&#8208;fixed N&#8722;Ar linkage results in a highly modular ligand topology, entering the range of geometries inaccessible to IMes and IPr. These ligands are highly reactive in Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydroboration, an archetypal borylcupration process that has had a transformative impact on the synthesis of boron&#8208;containing compounds. The most reactive Cu(I)&#8208;NHC in this class has been commercialized in collaboration with MilliporeSigma to enable broad access of the synthetic chemistry community. The ligands gradually cover %Vbur geometries ranging from 37.3&#8201;% to 52.7&#8201;%, with the latter representing the largest %Vbur described for an IPr analogue, while retaining full flexibility of N&#8208;wingtip. Considering the modular access to novel geometrical space in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis, we anticipate that this concept will enable new opportunities in organic synthesis, drug discovery and stabilization of reactive metal centers.

         <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Achiral Molecules Leading to the Formation of Homochiral Superstructures that Exhibit Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a library of six achiral pyrene&#8208;containing molecules and two counterexamples to demonstrate the powerful strategy for spontaneous symmetry breaking. When the polarity of the crystals resulting from symmetry breaking is coupled with the intrinsic photophysical property of pyrene moieties, the three polar crystals exhibit intense mechanoluminescence.







Abstract
Chirality, with its intrinsic symmetry&#8208;breaking feature, is frequently utilized in the creation of acentric crystalline functional materials that exhibit intriguing optoelectronic properties. On the other hand, the development of chiral crystals from achiral molecules offers a solution that bypasses the need for enantiopure motifs, presenting a promising alternative and thereby expanding the possibilities of the self&#8208;assembly toolkit. Nevertheless, the rational design of achiral molecules that prefer spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization has so far been obscure. In this study, we present a series of six achiral molecules, demonstrating that when these conformationally flexible molecules adopt a cis&#8208;conformation and engage in multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions along a helical path, they collectively self&#8208;assemble into chiral superstructures consisting of single&#8208;handed supramolecular columns. When these homochiral supramolecular columns align in parallel, they form polar crystals that exhibit intense luminescence upon grinding or scraping. We therefore demonstrate our molecular design strategy could significantly increase the likelihood of symmetry breaking in achiral molecular synthons during self&#8208;assembly, offering a facile access to novel chiral crystalline materials with unique optoelectronic properties.

Abstract
The development of highly efficient catalysts to address the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a series of multi&#8208;site catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MSC&#8208;MOFs) were elaborated through multimodal molecular engineering to regulate both the reactant diffusion and catalysis processes. MSC&#8208;MOFs were crafted with nanocages featuring collaborative specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces formed by exposed mixed&#8208;valence metal sites and surrounding adsorption sites. This design facilitates internal preconcentration, a coadsorption mechanism, and continuous efficient catalytic conversion toward polysulfides concurrently. Leveraging these attributes, LSBs with an MSC&#8208;MOF&#8208;Ti catalytic interlayer demonstrated a 62&#8201;% improvement in discharge capacity and cycling stability. This resulted in achieving a high areal capacity (11.57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at a high sulfur loading (9.32&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under lean electrolyte conditions, along with a pouch cell exhibiting an ultra&#8208;high gravimetric energy density of 350.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Lastly, this work introduces a universal strategy for the development of a new class of efficient catalytic MOFs, promoting SRR and suppressing the shuttle effect at the molecular level. The findings shed light on the design of advanced porous catalytic materials for application in high&#8208;energy LSBs.

         <title>Step&#8208;growth Polymerization of Aziridines with Elemental Sulfur: Easy Access to Linear Polysulfides and Their Use as Recyclable Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear polysulfides are prepared through a highly efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization of bis(N&#8208;sulfonyl/carbonyl aziridine) with elemental sulfur in the presence of organobase. The blend of the produced polysulfides with pyridine shows exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates.







Abstract
The bulk radical polymerization of bis(aziridine) with molten elemental sulfur resulted in brittle, cross&#8208;linked polymers. However, when the bis(aziridine) was treated with elemental sulfur in the presence of an organobase, the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine with oligosulfide anions occurred, leading to the formation of linear polymers by step&#8208;growth polymerization. These newly synthesized polymers possess repeating units containing a sulfonamide or amide functional moiety and oligosulfide bonds with an average sulfur segment of about two. A small molecular model reaction confirmed the nucleophilic addition reaction of elemental sulfur to aziridine. It was verified that S&#8722;S dynamic bond exchange takes place in the presence of an organic base within the linear chains. The mixture of the synthesized polysulfides with pyridine exhibits exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates. Notably, these prepared adhesives displayed good reusability due to the dynamic S&#8722;S exchange and complete recyclability due to their solution processability. This elemental sulfur&#8208;involved polymerization approach represents an innovative method for the synthesis of advanced sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, demonstrating the potential for various applications in adhesives and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;Linear polysulfides are prepared through a highly efficient step-growth polymerization of bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl/carbonyl aziridine) with elemental sulfur in the presence of organobase. The blend of the produced polysulfides with pyridine shows exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk radical polymerization of bis(aziridine) with molten elemental sulfur resulted in brittle, cross-linked polymers. However, when the bis(aziridine) was treated with elemental sulfur in the presence of an organobase, the ring-opening reaction of aziridine with oligosulfide anions occurred, leading to the formation of linear polymers by step-growth polymerization. These newly synthesized polymers possess repeating units containing a sulfonamide or amide functional moiety and oligosulfide bonds with an average sulfur segment of about two. A small molecular model reaction confirmed the nucleophilic addition reaction of elemental sulfur to aziridine. It was verified that S&#8722;S dynamic bond exchange takes place in the presence of an organic base within the linear chains. The mixture of the synthesized polysulfides with pyridine exhibits exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates. Notably, these prepared adhesives displayed good reusability due to the dynamic S&#8722;S exchange and complete recyclability due to their solution processability. This elemental sulfur-involved polymerization approach represents an innovative method for the synthesis of advanced sulfur-containing polymers, demonstrating the potential for various applications in adhesives and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton Reaction Mediated by Atomically Dispersed Ag&#8722;Co Photocatalysts toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction by in situ generation of H2O2, with dual atoms sites for accelerating photoinduced charge separation and forming the Fenton&#8208;redox centers by the Ag and Co single atoms, respectively, generating the free radicals of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and non&#8208;radicals of singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to the complete mineralization of organics in wastewater.







Abstract
Achieving the complete mineralization of persistent pollutants in wastewater is still a big challenge. Here, we propose an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for the degradation of different pollutants using the high&#8208;density (Ag: 22&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of atomically dispersed AgCo dual sites embedded in graphic carbon nitride (AgCo&#8722;CN). Comprehensive experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag and Co dual sites in AgCo&#8722;CN play a critical role in accelerating the photoinduced charge separation and forming the self&#8208;Fenton redox centers, respectively. The bimetallic AgCo&#8722;CN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance toward the phenol even under extreme conditions due to an efficient degradation pathway and in situ generation of the hydrogen peroxide producing the main active oxygen species (&#8901;OH and 1O2) and showed long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for the purification of the phenol. Our discoveries pave the way for the design of efficient single&#8208;atoms photocatalysts&#8208;based photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for recalcitrant pollutant treatment.

         <title>Jahn&#8211;Teller Distortions Induced by in situ Li Migration in &#955;&#8208;MnO2 for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ Lithium (Li) migration strategy was proposed to suppress Li deposition and promote reconfiguration of the active site by breaking the structural integrity of MnO6 octahedron. In this scenario, the unique Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions induced by the elongated Mn&#8722;O bond optimized the spin&#8208;electron architecture of cationic disordered LiMn2O4 toward efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) completely eschews the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred in aqueous system, whereas the continuous deposition of lithium readily blocks the active sites and further reduces the reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose an innovative in situ Li migration strategy to realize that Li substitutes Mn sites in &#955;&#8208;MnO2 instead of evolving into the dead Li. Comprehensive characterizations corroborate that the intercalation of Li+ at high voltage breaks the structural integrity of MnO6 octahedron and further triggers unique Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions, which promotes the spin state regulation of Mn sites to generate the ameliorative eg orbital configuration and accelerates N&#8801;N bond cleavage via eg&#8208;&#963; and eg&#8208;&#960;* interaction. To this end, the resulted cationic disordered LiMnO4 delivers the recorded highest NH3 yield rate of 220&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) 83.80&#8201;% in organic electrolyte.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Deaminative Trifluoromethylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct deaminative trifluoromethylation of inactivated aliphatic primary amines with N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) under blue light irradiation is reported. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance and can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into organic molecules is of paramount importance in modern synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. While methods for constructing C(sp2)&#8722;CF3 bonds have been well established, the advancement of practical and comprehensive approaches for forming C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bonds remains considerably restricted. In this work, we describe an efficient and site&#8208;specific deaminative trifluoromethylation reaction of aliphatic primary amines to afford the corresponding alkyl trifluoromethyl compounds. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with readily accessible N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) under blue light. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and moderate to good yields. Remarkably, the method can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies were conducted, and a radical mechanism is proposed, wherein the dual roles of Grushin's reagent have been elucidated.

         <title>Localized Medium Concentration Electrolyte with Fast Kinetics for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;Localized Medium Concentration Electrolyte&#8221; (LMCE) by diluting a medium concentration (0.5&#8197;M&#8211;1.5&#8197;M) electrolyte. After diluting, LMCE demonstrated excellent compatibility with lithium metal and exceptional kinetics even with ultralow concentration. This LMCE design transforms the seemingly &#8220;impossible&#8221; into the &#8220;possible,&#8221; paving the way for further exploration of diverse electrolyte formulations.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte is widely acknowledged as a cutting&#8208;edge electrolyte for the lithium metal anode. However, the high fluorine content, either from high&#8208;concentration salts or from highly fluorinated diluents, results in significantly higher production costs and an increased environmental burden. Here, we have developed a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;Localized Medium&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte&#8221; (LMCE) to effectively address these issues. This LMCE is designed and produced by diluting a medium concentration (0.5&#8197;M&#8211;1.5&#8197;M) electrolyte which is incompatible with lithium metal anode before diluting. It has ultralow concentration (0.1&#8197;M) and demonstrates remarkable compatibility with lithium metal anode. Surprisingly, our LMCE, despite having an ultralow concentration (0.1&#8197;M), exhibits excellent kinetics in Li/Cu, Li/Li, LiFePO4/Li, and NCM811/Li batteries. Additionally, LMCE effectively inhibits the corrosion of the Al current collector caused by LiTFSI salt under high voltage (&gt;4&#8197;V) conditions. This groundbreaking LMCE design transforms the seemingly &#8220;incompatible&#8221; into the &#8220;compatible&#8221;, opening up new avenues for exploring various electrolyte formulations, including all liquid electrolyte&#8208;based batteries.

This groundbreaking LMCE design transforms the seemingly &#8220;incompatible&#8221; into the &#8220;compatible&#8221;, opening up new avenues for exploring various electrolyte formulations, including all liquid electrolyte-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Polymerization for Facile Aqueous&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report an ionic liquid&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization for designing highly crystalline enzyme&#8208;covalent organic framework (COF) biocatalysts. The highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; affords the hosted lipase with non&#8208;native catalytic selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. Meanwhile the high photocatalytic activity of crystalline COF enables us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled nanoreactor for pollutants degradation.







Abstract
Utilizing covalent organic framework (COF) as a hypotoxic and porous scaffold to encapsulate enzyme (enzyme@COF) has inspired numerous interests at the intersection of chemistry, materials, and biological science. In this study, we report a convenient scheme for one&#8208;step, aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis of highly crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts. This facile approach relies on an ionic liquid (2&#8197;&#956;L of imidazolium ionic liquid)&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization mechanism, which can facilitate the in situ assembly of enzyme@COF under mild conditions. This green strategy is adaptive to synthesize different biocatalysts with highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221;, as well evidenced by the low&#8208;dose cryo&#8208;EM and other characterizations. Attributing to the rigorous sieving effect of crystalline COF pore, the hosted lipase shows non&#8208;native selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. In addition, the highly crystalline linkage affords COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; with higher photocatalytic activity for in situ production of H2O2, enabling us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled reactor for pollutants degradation, with a 2.63&#8208;fold degradation rate as the poorly crystalline photo&#8208;enzyme reactor. This work showcases the great potentials of employing green and trace amounts of ionic liquid for one&#8208;step synthesis of crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts, and emphasizes the feasibility of diversifying enzyme functions by integrating the reticular chemistry of a COF.

         <title>Polymeric Metal Halides with Bright Luminescence and Versatile Processability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of polycations into metal halides as A&#8208;site cations results in a series of polymeric metal halides with bright luminescence and versatile processability. This bottom&#8208;up approach retains the excellent luminescent properties of inorganic metal&#8208;halogen units while introducing the desirable plasticity and processability of polymers.







Abstract
Most of current metal halide materials, including all inorganic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids, are crystalline materials with poor workability and plasticity that limit their application scope. Here, we develop a novel class of materials termed polymeric metal halides (PMHs) through introducing polycations into antimony&#8208;based metal halide materials as A&#8208;site cations. A series of PMHs with orange&#8208;yellow broadband emission and large Stokes shift originating from inorganic self&#8208;trapped excitons are successfully prepared, which meanwhile exhibit the excellent processability and formability of polymers. The versatility of these PMHs is manifested as the broad choices of polycations, the ready extension to manganese&#8208; and copper&#8208;based halides, and the tolerance to molar ratios between polycations and metal halides in the formation of PMHs. The merger of polymer chemistry and inorganic chemistry thus provides a novel generic platform for the development of metal halide functional materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper oxide Nd2NiO4+&#948; exhibits magnetic anisotropy and oxygen transport anisotropy. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets. The grain&#8208;oriented membrane has an oxygen flux five times higher than that of the random oriented membrane, as reported by Zhijun Zhao, Armin Feldhoff et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202312473).

The built&#8208;in electric field of polymer semiconductors determines its interfacial space charge and band bending to separate electrons and holes. In their Research Article (e202318224), Yi&#8208;Jing Chen, Zhi&#8208;Xing Wu, Jing&#8208;Xin Jian et&#8197;al. report three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers with different molecular orientations of ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylenediamine linkers. By regulating the dipole moment of PDI derivatives, a robust BIEF was created to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieve efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in most covalent systems. In their Research Article (e202315064), Rik&#8197;R. Tykwinski, Dirk&#8197;M. Guldi et&#8197;al. present a hexameric pentacene system with strong inter&#8208;pentacene couplings, capable of undergoing rapid intramolecular singlet fission while, simultaneously, achieving considerably increased yields of free triplets. These typically contradictory observations have been attributed to intramolecular cluster formation, which orchestrates a diffusive spatial separation of triplet excitons from a coupling hotspot between a pair of particularly strongly&#8208;coupled pentacenes.

         <title>Cover Picture: Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2024)</title>

A nanodesigned Pt/MnOx interface for enhanced activity in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is reported by Andr&#225;s S&#225;pi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317343). As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Connecting Biological and Synthetic Approaches for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 utilization has quickly expanded and diversified into employing a wide range of catalysts and device configurations. This mini&#8208;review seeks to highlight the significant progress and common elements in heterogeneous, small molecule and enzymatic systems to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate approaches and to provide a more holistic and unified strategy to develop the field of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has developed into a broad field, spanning fundamental studies of enzymatic &#8216;model&#8217; catalysts to synthetic molecular catalysts and heterogeneous gas diffusion electrodes producing commercially relevant quantities of product. This diversification has resulted in apparent differences and a disconnect between seemingly related approaches when using different types of catalysts. Enzymes possess discrete and well understood active sites that can perform reactions with high selectivity and activities at their thermodynamic limit. Synthetic small molecule catalysts can be designed with desired active site composition but do not yet display enzyme&#8208;like performance. These properties of the biological and small molecule catalysts contrast with heterogeneous materials, which can contain multiple, often poorly understood active sites with distinct reactivity and therefore introducing significant complexity in understanding their activities. As these systems are being better understood and the continuously improving performance of their heterogeneous active sites closes the gap with enzymatic activity, this performance difference between heterogeneous and enzymatic systems begins to close. This convergence removes the barriers between using different types of catalysts and future challenges can be addressed without multiple efforts as a unified picture for the biological&#8208;synthetic catalyst spectrum emerges.

         <title>Recent Developments with Organogermanes: their Preparation and Application in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogermanes have historically been underutilized as prospective coupling partners. Recent studies have uncovered alternative activation modes that unlocked their chemoselective and orthogonal reactivity, thereby transforming the germanium motif into the most reactive site on a given substrate. Herein are shown some of the latest advances for organogermane chemistry with respect to their application in synthetic transformations and preparation.







Abstract
Within the sphere of traditional Pd0/PdII cross coupling reactions, organogermanes have been historically outperformed both in terms of scope and reactivity by more conventional transmetalating reagents. Subsequently, this class of compounds has been largely underutilized as a coupling partner in bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most recent studies, however, have shown that alternative modes of activation of these notoriously robust building blocks transform organogermanes into the most reactive site of the molecule&#8212;capable of outcompeting other functional groups (such as boronic acids, esters and silanes) for both C&#8722;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation. As a result, over the past few years, the literature has increasingly featured methodologies that explore the potential of organogermanes as chemoselective and orthogonal coupling partners. Herein we highlight some of these recent advances in the field of organogermane chemistry both with respect to their synthesis and applications in synthetic and catalytic transformations.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional customizability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted significant interest for function&#8208;oriented materials design. Recent advances in functionalization strategies and constructing COF&#8208;based therapeutic nanoplatforms for cancer therapy are highlighted, and some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are discussed to promote the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines.







Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.

         <title>Bismuth in Radical Chemistry and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we explore the evolution of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds, tracing it back to the 19th century and delving into the key milestones that fueled its development. These discoveries paved the way for the application of bismuth&#8208;centered radical processes within the broad fields of organic synthesis and catalysis.







Abstract
Whereas indications of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds can be traced back to the 19th century, the preparation and characterization of both transient and persistent bismuth&#8208;radical species has only been established in recent decades. These advancements led to the emergence of the field of bismuth radical chemistry, mirroring the progress seen for other main&#8208;group elements. The seminal and fundamental studies in this area have ultimately paved the way for the development of catalytic methodologies involving bismuth&#8208;radical intermediates, a promising approach that remains largely untapped in the broad landscape of synthetic organic chemistry. In this review, we delve into the milestones that eventually led to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field of radical bismuth chemistry. Our focus aims at outlining the intrinsic discoveries in fundamental inorganic/organometallic chemistry and contextualizing their practical applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Lignin Upconversion by Functionalization and Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides insights into up&#8208;conversion of lignin, which is a major byproduct of paper and pulp industries and has highly polyphenolic structure. Lignin can be functionalized through chemical and enzymatic routes to develop value&#8208;added chemicals for industries. Further, cross&#8208;linking strategies lead to the development of functional materials such as polymeric resins, bioplastics, hydrogels, nanocarriers and carbon fibers.







Abstract
Lignin, a complex and abundant biopolymer derived from plant cell walls, has emerged as a promising feedstock for sustainable material development. Due to the high abundance of phenylpropanoid units, aromatic rings, and hydroxyl groups, lignin is an ideal candidate for being explored in various material applications. Therefore, the demand on lignin valorization for development of value&#8208;added products is significantly increasing. This mini&#8208;review provides an overview of lignin upconversion, focusing on its functionalization through chemical and enzymatic routes, and its application in lignin&#8208;based polymer resins, hydrogels, and nanomaterials. The functionalization of lignin molecules with various chemical groups offers tailored properties and increased compatibility with other materials, expanding its potential applications. Additionally, the formation of lignin&#8208;based networks, either through cross&#8208;linking or blending with polymers, generates novel materials with improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. However, challenges remain in optimizing functionalization techniques, preserving the innate complexity of lignin, and achieving scalability for industrial implementation. As lignin&#8216;s potential continues to be unlocked, it is poised to contribute significantly to the shift towards more eco&#8208;friendly and resource&#8208;efficient industries.

         <title>Thermolysis of Biphenylene toward Cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of arylated biphenylenes provides one&#8208;step access to [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) while avoiding linear oligomers. Solubilizing substituents allow separation of these macrocycles by recycling&#8208;GPC. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of biphenylenes at 350&#8201;&#176;C furnishes [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) in one step and in high yields. At 400&#8201;&#176;C biphenylene dimerizes into tetraphenylene, but lower reaction temperatures produce cyclooligomers. If suitably substituted, the oligomers are soluble and can be isolated and characterized. The products are exclusively cyclic. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.

         <title>Multiplying Oxygen Permeability of a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Oxide by Orientation Control via Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide Nd2NiO4+&#948; particles can be aligned in a magnetic field generated by NdFeB magnets. A textured asymmetric membrane prepared in this way exhibited oxygen flux five times higher than a conventional membrane. In contrast to perovskite oxides, the material also showed excellent CO2&#8208;stability highlighted by an O2 flux of 1.4&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#8197;h at 1223&#8197;K under pure CO2 sweeping.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;type oxides exhibit remarkable chemical stability in comparison to perovskite oxides. However, they display lower oxygen permeability. We present an approach to overcome this trade&#8208;off by leveraging the anisotropic properties of Nd2NiO4+&#948;. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field (0.81 T). A stable and high oxygen flux of 1.40&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved for at least 120&#8197;h at 1223&#8197;K by a textured asymmetric disk membrane with 1.0&#8197;mm thickness under the pure CO2 sweeping. Its excellent operational stability was also verified even at 1023&#8197;K in pure CO2. These findings highlight the significant enhancement in oxygen permeation membrane performance achievable by adjusting the grain orientation. Consequently, Nd2NiO4+&#948; emerges as a promising candidate for industrial applications in air separation, syngas production, and CO2 capture under harsh conditions.

         <title>Production of Biobased Ethylbenzene by Cascade Biocatalysis with an Engineered Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of commodity chemicals from renewable resources is vital for a sustainable society. A non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade is reported for the one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with up to 82&#8201;% conversion. The key enzyme, a photodecarboxylase, was semirationally engineered to boost productivity. The cascade was integrated with a fermentation process to yield ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol.







Abstract
Production of commodity chemicals, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), from renewable resources is key for a sustainable society. Biocatalysis enables one&#8208;pot multistep transformation of bioresources under mild conditions, yet it is often limited to biochemicals. Herein, we developed a non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade for one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene. The key rate&#8208;limiting photodecarboxylase was subjected to structure&#8208;guided semirational engineering, and a triple mutant CvFAP(Y466T/P460A/G462I) was obtained with a 6.3&#8208;fold higher productivity. With this improved photodecarboxylase, an optimized two&#8208;cell sequential process was developed to convert l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with 82&#8201;% conversion. The cascade reaction was integrated with fermentation to achieve the one&#8208;pot bioproduction of ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol, demonstrating the potential of cascade biocatalysis plus enzyme engineering for the production of biobased commodity chemicals.

         <title>Regiodivergent Arylation of Pyridines via Zincke Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylation of pyridines is possible through ring&#8208;opened Zincke imines. A Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type process is selective for the C4 position, while a metal&#8208;free arylation using an iodonium salt addresses the C5&#8208;position. Sequential triflation, arylation, and pyridine recyclization enables the process to be conducted in one pot, representing a new approach to valuable biaryl structures.







Abstract
An arylation protocol for pyridines is described, via the ring&#8208;opened Zincke intermediate. Treatment of pyridines with triflic anhydride and a secondary amine produces an azahexatriene species, which undergoes regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation at the putative C4 position. Recyclization then provides the pyridine products. Alternatively, metal&#8208;free arylation with a diaryliodonium salt is selective for the pyridine meta&#8208;position, affording a regiodivergent approach to pyridine biaryls from a common intermediate.

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Enables Direct Synthesis of Atropisomeric Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyst with chiral phosphine ligands enables the successful asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of phosphines using aryl and heteroaryl iodides, allowing for the construction of diverse and atroposelective phosphine ligands of practical significance.







Abstract
Atropisomeric phosphines hold considerable significance in asymmetric catalysis, yet their synthesis presents a formidable challenge owing to intricate multistep procedures. In this context, a groundbreaking methodology has been presented for their preparation. This innovative approach entails an atroposelective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation employing aryl and heteroaryl halides, chelated by a P(III) center. The essence of this strategy lies in its ability to directly construct chiral phosphine ligands in a single step, thereby exhibiting exceptional efficiency in terms of atom and redox economy. Illustrative examples serve to demonstrate the immense potential of in situ&#8208;formed ligands in asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic experiments have further provided invaluable insights into this transformation.

         <title>Intramolecular Carboamination of Aminodienes to N&#8208;Heterocycles via C&#8722;N Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes via C&#8722;N bond activation enabled by a unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system is described. This reaction features high atom&#8208;economy and provides rapid access to a range of pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives.







Abstract
The catalytic transformation of ubiquitous but inert C&#8722;N bonds is highly appealing in synthetic chemistry, but the efficient cleaving inert C&#8722;N bond and simultaneous incorporation of both the cleaved C&#8208;moiety and N&#8208;moiety into the desired products has been a long&#8208;standing formidable challenge so far. Here, we developed a radical&#8208;addition triggered cyclization and C&#8722;N bond cleavage process enabled by the unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system, allowing the formal insertion of diene into the inert C&#8722;N bond. This reaction features high atom economy and enables an expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes to diverse pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the reaction is initiated via the generation of a benzyl radical and the formation of quaternary ammonium salt is key for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.

         <title>Photoinduced Decarboxylative Radical Phosphinylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative radical phosphinylation of N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimides with aryl&#8208; or alkylphosphonites has been accomplished under metal&#8208;free conditions. An unprecedented mechanism involving the formation and subsequent oxidation of phosphoranyl radicals is proposed.







Abstract
Reported herein is an unprecedented protocol for C(sp3)&#8208;phosphinylation. With 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% 4CzIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, the visible light induced reaction of redox&#8208;active esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with dimethyl arylphosphonites or diethyl alkylphosphonites at room temperature provides the corresponding decarboxylative phosphinylation products in satisfactory yields. The protocol exhibits broad substrate scope and wide functional&#8208;group compatibility, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and rapid synthesis of bioactive phosphinic acids such as glutamine synthetase phosphinothricin and a kynureninase inhibitor. A radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism involving the formation and subsequent oxidation of phosphoranyl radicals followed by nucleophilic demethylation (or deethylation) is proposed.

         <title>Exploring the Fate of Copper Ions in the Synthesis of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where does the copper catalyst used for graphdiyne (GDY) synthesis finally go? It was found that these copper ions are tightly adsorbed on the atomic layer of GDY. Fortunately, they can be in situ converted into copper ultrathin nanocrystals and applied for pollutant enrichment and detection.







Abstract
Copper is a crucial catalyst in the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY). However, as catalysts, the final fate of the copper ions has hardly been concerned, which are usually treated as impurities. Here, it is observed that after simple washing with water and ethanol, GDY still contains a certain amount of copper ions, and demonstrated that the copper ions are adsorbed at the atomic layers of GDY. Furthermore, we transformed in situ the copper ions into ultrathin Cu nanocrystals, and the obtained Cu/GDY hybrids can be generally converted into a series of metal/GDY hybrid materials, such as Ag/GDY, Au/GDY, Pt/GDY, Pd/GDY, and Rh/GDY. The Cu/GDY hybrids exhibit extraordinary surface enhanced Raman scattering effect and can be applied in pollutant efficient enrichment and detection.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Synthesis of Amine&#8208;Free CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets for Stable, Pure&#8208;Blue Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first amine&#8208;free synthesis route for CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPL). The designated ligands provide steric control and prevent the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth in amine&#8208;free route. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the ligand binds more strongly on NPLs compared with ammonium ligands. The resulting NPLs&#8217; stability against severe heating is 10&#8197;times higher than the best&#8208;reported pure&#8208;blue NPLs.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) have demonstrated excellent optical properties for light&#8208;emitting applications and achieved tunable blue luminescence through thickness control. However, their translation into electronic devices has lagged behind due to poor colloidal and film stability. The main reason for this is the deprotonation of their surface&#8208;capped ammonium passivating ligands, resulting in NPL aggregation. Here we report the first facile synthesis of amine&#8208;free pure&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 NPLs with outstanding thermal and light stability. This is achieved by utilizing an amine&#8208;free phosphine oxide route with a surface capping molecule exhibiting large steric hindrance to prevent NPL aggregation. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D&#8197;NMR) spectroscopy suggests slower ligand exchange in amine&#8208;free NPLs compared to the conventional NPLs, which can be attributed to the strong binding strength of the designated ligand. Consequently, the amine&#8208;free NPLs exhibited superior stability against radiation, heat and moisture. We further demonstrate the importance of acid&#8208;base equilibrium in this amine&#8208;free synthesis route. Through solvent neutralization and passivation with various alkali carbonates, the resulting NPLs attained near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and pure blue emission.

         <title>Above&#8208;Tg Annealing Benefits in Nanoparticle&#8208;Stabilized Carbon Molecular Sieve Membrane Pyrolysis for Improved Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;particle&#8208;fillers were introduced to the core layer of the sheath&#8208;core spun composite hollow fiber membranes to suppress the membrane matrix collapse during the pyrolysis. Defect healing hybridization gave a CMS membrane with extraordinary gas separation performance: CO2/CH4 selectivity of 134.2 with 71.1&#8197;GPU CO2 permeance as well as H2/CH4 selectivity of 662.6 with 239.6&#8197;GPU H2 permeance.







Abstract
Nanoparticles can suppress asymmetric precursor support collapse during pyrolysis to create carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes. This advance allows elimination of standard sol&#8208;gel support stabilization steps. Here we report a simple but surprisingly important thermal soaking step at 400&#8201;&#176;C in the pyrolysis process to obtain high performance CMS membranes. The composite CMS membranes show CO2/CH4 (50&#8201;:&#8201;50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 134.2 and CO2 permeance of 71&#8197;GPU at 35&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, a H2/CH4 selectivity of 663 with H2 permeance of 240&#8197;GPU was achieved for promising green energy resource&#8208;H2 separation processes.

         <title>Diaryltriazolium Photoswitch: Reaching a Millisecond Cycloreversion with High Stability and NIR Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryltriazolium photoswitch (DAT+) was prepared by alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition followed by alkylation. Due to a charged heterocyclic bridge, the closed isomer of DAT+ exhibits the most bathochromically shifted absorption maximum and the shortest thermal half&#8208;life reported for any diarylethene thus far. The new photoswitch exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and is well water&#8208;soluble.







Abstract
The exceptional thermal stability of diarylethene closed isomers enabled many applications but also prevented utilization in photochromic systems that require rapid thermal reversibility. Herein, we report the diaryltriazolium (DAT+) photoswitch undergoing thermal cycloreversion within a few milliseconds and absorption of the closed form in the near&#8208;infrared region above 900&#8197;nm. Click chemistry followed by alkylation offers modular and fast access to the electron&#8208;deficient DAT+ scaffold. In addition to excellent fatigue resistance, the introduced charge increases water solubility, rendering this photoswitch an ideal candidate for exploring biological applications.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Multicomponent Fluoroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes: Concise Construction of Diverse Cyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes to produce substituted allenes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were generated efficiently and selectively. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions, particularly those entailing four or more reagents, have presented a longstanding challenge due to the inherent complexities associated with balancing reactivity, selectivity, and compatibility. In this study, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were efficiently and selectively integrated in a single chemical operation. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent. This approach also provides a valuable strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of naturally occurring molecules and concise construction of diverse cyclic compounds.

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helical Fibres from Chiral Phenylacetylene Monomers: Cation Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
P or M helical coordination polymers can be obtained by mixing a phenylacetylene (PA) derivative with an AgClO4 salt. The ability of the metal ion to coordinate the terminal alkyne, combined with the argentophilicity of the metal ion led to the formation of a helical coordination polymer, whose axial chirality is determined by the PA substituent, in this case a chiral sulfoxide group.







Abstract
Chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular fibres can be easily obtained by mixing a chloroform solution of a phenylacetylene monomer (PA) that bears a chiral sulfoxide group as pendant, with different equivalents of a methanolic solution of AgClO4. Thus, while the PA is found molecularly dissolved in chloroform, the addition of Ag+ ions induce its aggregation through the formation of an axially chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular aggregate with high thermal stable properties. In this case, the ability of the metal ion to coordinate the PA triple bond, combined with the argentophilicity of the metal ion and the planarity of the phenylacetylene drives to the formation of a helical coordination polymer, whose P or M axial chirality is determined by the chirality of the sulfoxide used as substituent of the PA. Depending on the PA/Ag+ (mol/mol) ratio, it is possible to tune the morphology of the metallo&#8208;supramolecular aggregate from chiral fibers to chiral gel.

         <title>Metallacyclobuta&#8208;(2,3)&#8208;diene: A Bidentate Ligand for Stream&#8208;line Synthesis of First Row Transition Metal Catalysts for Cyclic Polymerization of Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe in this work how simple&#8208;to&#8208;prepare complexes composed of base metals such as Ti and V can be used as catalysts for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene. These catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of the corresponding [(BDI)MCl2] with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] to form [(BDI)M{&#954;2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (BDI=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M=Ti, V), therefore circumventing the need to utilize transition metal alkylidynes as catalyst precursors.







Abstract
Described here is a direct entry to two examples of 3d transition metal catalysts that are active for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene, namely, [(BDI)M{&#954;2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (2&#8208;M) (BDI=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M=Ti, V). Catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of [(BDI)MCl2] (1&#8208;M, M=Ti, V) with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)]. Complexes 2&#8208;M have been spectroscopically and structurally characterized and the polymers that are catalytically formed from phenylacetylene were verified to have a cyclic topology based on a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) and intrinsic viscosity studies. Two&#8208;electron oxidation of 2&#8208;V with nitrous oxide (N2O) cleanly yields a [VV] alkylidene&#8208;alkynyl oxo complex [(BDI)V(=O){&#954;1&#8208;C&#8208;(=C(SiMe3)CC(SiMe3))}] (3), which lends support for how this scaffold in 2&#8208;M might be operating in the polymerization of the terminal alkyne. This work demonstrates how alkylidynes can be circumvented using 1,3&#8208;dianionic allene as a segue into M&#8722;C multiple bonds.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrrole&#8208;Sharing Fused Porphyrinoid Hybrids by Post&#8208;fabrication of Ni(II) Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel fused dyads and triads of NiII&#8208;porphyrin, PdII NC&#8208;corrole, and PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin were synthesized by post&#8208;fabrication of NiII porphyrins. In these fused oligomers, PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin is aromatic and PdII NC&#8208;corrole is moderately antiaromatic. These local electronic properties interact to influence the overall electronic networks in the hybrids.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;sharing fused hybrids of NiII porphyrin with PdII N&#8208;confused(NC)&#8208;corrole and PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin were synthesized by post&#8208;fabrication of NiII porphyrins. Specifically this consists of Friedel&#8211;Crafts type aromatic substitution reaction of meso&#8208;free NiII porphyrin with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dibromotripyrrin and Pd(OAc)2 assisted cyclization, and final heating to induce a Pd&#8722;C bond formation. NiII porphyrins fused with PdII NC&#8208;corrole and with PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrins show coplanar structures with a shared pyrrole unit. In these hybrids, the PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin is aromatic and the PdII NC&#8208;corrole is moderately antiaromatic and these local electronic properties interact to influence the whole network.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Ring with Inherent Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing efficient protocols to construct inherent chirality is highly desirable owing to its tremendous application in chiral recognition and enantioselective synthesis. Herein, we report the first enantioselective synthesis of 7&#8208;membered inherently chiral derivatives via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation. This chemistry highlights the broad substrate scope and excellent stereocontrol (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Inherent chirality is used to describe chiral cyclic molecules devoid of central, axial, planar, or helical chirality and has tremendous applications in chiral recognition and enantioselective synthesis. Catalytic and divergent syntheses of inherently chiral molecules have attracted increasing interest from chemists. Herein, we report the enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral tribenzocycloheptene derivatives via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed condensation of cyclic ketones and hydroxylamines. This chemistry paves the way to accessing the less stable derivatives of 7&#8208;membered rings with inherent chirality. A series of chiral tribenzocycloheptene oxime ethers was synthesized in good yields (up to 97&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Guest&#8208;Facilitated Heteroleptic Assembly of Helical Anionocages Enables Reversible Chirality Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest&#8208;facilitated heteroleptic assembly of helical anionocages has proved effective for chirality modulation of a supramolecular system, which was induced by effective chirality transfer from the chiral to achiral ligands. While both the endo&#8208;guest (bound in the cavity) and exo&#8208;guest (K+, bound in the crown ethers) are effective for chirality modulation, only that induced by K+ could be reversibly switched.







Abstract
We report a novel strategy for reversible modulation of the supramolecular chirality based on guest&#8208;facilitated heteroleptic assembly of helical anionocages. Two triple&#8208;stranded helical anionocages including a chiral cage 1 (A2L13) and a crown ether functionalized achiral cage 2 (A2L23) were synthesized by anion coordination of bis&#8208;monourea&#8208;based ligands and PhPO32&#8722;. Both cages exhibited favorable binding with tetraethylammonium TEA+ and cobaltocenium Cob+ (endo&#8208;guest, bound in the cavity). Additionally, cage 2 could reversibly release and recapture the guests through binding the exo&#8208;guest potassium ions (K+) in the crown ethers and subsequent removal of the K+ by [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of cage 1 was not significantly affected by guest encapsulation or mixing with the &#8220;empty&#8221; cage 2. However, in the presence of both cage 2 and an endo&#8208;guest/exo&#8208;guest, the Cotton effects were reversed at 391&#8197;nm and significantly enhanced at 310&#8197;nm. This observation was attributed to the guest&#8208;facilitated formation of heteroleptic cages that enabled effective chirality transfer from the chiral to the achiral ligands. The CD changes induced by K+ could be fully reversed by removing it with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand. Sequential addition and removal of K+ allowed reversible modulation of the chirality for at least 10&#8197;cycles without significant attenuation.

         <title>Where do the Fluorine Atoms Go in the Inorganic&#8208;oxide Fluorinations? A Fluorooxoborate Illustration under the Terahertz Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substitution of fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms/hydroxyl groups has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the physical and chemical properties of oxides/hydroxides in fluorine chemistry. However, distinguishing fluorine from oxygen/hydroxyl in the reaction products poses a significant challenge in existing characterization methods. In this study, we illustrate that terahertz (THz) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. To this end, we investigated two fluorination reactions of boric acid, utilizing MHF2 (M=Na, C(NH2)3) as fluorine reagents. Through an interplay between THz spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state density functional theory, we have conclusively demonstrated that fluorine atoms exclusively bind with the sp3&#8208;boron but not with the sp2&#8208;boron in the reaction products of Na[B(OH)3][B3O3F2(OH)2] (NaBOFH) and [C(NH2)3]2B3O3F4OH (GBF2). Based on this evidence, we have proposed a reaction pathway for the fluorinations under investigation, a process previously hindered due to structural ambiguity. This work represents a step forward in gaining a deeper understanding of the precise structures and reaction mechanisms involved in the fluorination of oxides/hydroxides, illuminated by the insights provided by THz spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Architecture for DNA&#8208;Templated Synthesis in Which Abasic Sites Protect Reactants from Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of artificial sequence&#8208;defined polymers that match and extend the functionality of proteins is an important goal in materials science. One way of achieving this is to program a sequence of chemical reactions between precursor building blocks by means of attached oligonucleotide adapters. However, hydrolysis of the reactive building blocks has so far limited the length and yield of product that can be obtained using DNA&#8208;templated reactions. Here, we report an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in which reactants are tethered at internal abasic sites on opposite strands of a DNA duplex. We show that an abasic site within a DNA duplex can protect a nearby thioester from degradation, significantly increasing the yield of a DNA&#8208;templated reaction. This protective effect has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with programmable sequence&#8208;controlled synthesis of long non&#8208;natural polymers by extending the lifetime of the reactive building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Doping Inhibits the Formation of Isomerization&#8208;Derived Structural Defects in N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has been made through in&#8208;situ oxidative polymerization and reductive doping, which exhibited exceptionally high electrical conductivities and optical transparency. The discovery of n&#8208;PBDF is considered a breakthrough in the field of organic semiconductors. In the initial report, the possibility of structural defect formation in n&#8208;PBDF was proposed, based on the observation of structural isomerization from (E)&#8208;2H,2&#8242;H&#8208;[3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuranylidene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dione (isoxindigo) to chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]chromene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione (dibenzonaphthyrone) in the dimer model reactions. In this study, we present clear evidence that structural isomerization is inhibited during polymerization. We reveal that the dimer (BFD1) and the trimer (BFD2) can be reductively doped by several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, forming charge transfer complexes (CTC) or undergoing an integer charge transfer (ICT) with reactants available during polymerization. Once the hydride adducts, the CTC, or the ICT product forms, structural isomerization can be effectively prevented even at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why isomerization&#8208;derived structural defects are absent in n&#8208;PBDF backbone. It lays a solid foundation for the future development of n&#8208;PBDF as a benchmark polymer for organic electronics and beyond.</dc:description>

In the initial report, the possibility of structural defect formation in n-PBDF was proposed, based on the observation of structural isomerization from (E)-2H,2&#8242;H-[3,3&#8242;-bibenzofuranylidene]-2,2&#8242;-dione (isoxindigo) to chromeno[4,3-c]chromene-5,11-dione (dibenzonaphthyrone) in the dimer model reactions. In this study, we present clear evidence that structural isomerization is inhibited during polymerization. We reveal that the dimer (BFD1) and the trimer (BFD2) can be reductively doped by several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, forming charge transfer complexes (CTC) or undergoing an integer charge transfer (ICT) with reactants available during polymerization. Once the hydride adducts, the CTC, or the ICT product forms, structural isomerization can be effectively prevented even at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why isomerization-derived structural defects are absent in n-PBDF backbone. It lays a solid foundation for the future development of n-PBDF as a benchmark polymer for organic electronics and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reaction with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8208;N to Se&#8208;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8208;N to Se&#8208;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is characterized by modular, predictable, high&#8208;yielding, fast kinetics (k2&#160;&#8805;&#160;14.43 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and working well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx), seleno&#8208;macrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry development, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Biomimetic Oxidative Folding of Cysteine&#8208;rich Peptides and Microproteins in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfides in peptides and proteins are essential for maintaining a properly folded structure. Their oxidative folding is invariably performed in an aqueous&#8208;buffered solution. However, this process is often slow and can lead to misfolded products. Here, we report a novel concept and strategy that is bio&#8208;inspired to mimic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) by accelerating disulfide exchange rates many thousand&#8208;fold. The proposed strategy termed organic oxidative folding is performed entirely under polar aprotic solvents to yield correctly folded microproteins instantaneously without observable misfolded or dead&#8208;end products. Compared to conventional aqueous oxidative folding strategies, enormously large rate accelerations up to 113,200&#8208;fold were observed. The feasibility and generality of the organic oxidative folding strategy was successfully demonstrated on 15 cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins of different hydrophobicity, lengths (14 to 58 residues), and numbers of disulfides (2 to 5 disulfides), producing the native products in a second and in high yield.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a series of enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were successfully synthesized via an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of carbagermatrane(Ge)&#8208;containing alkenes. Orthogonal cross&#8208;coupling selectivity under different Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions was achieved in an enantiospecific manner. Notably, the chiral secondary Ge exhibited a remarkable transmetallation ability prior to primary or secondary Bpin. The effectiveness of this Ge/B bimetallic strategy was further demonstrated through the development of new functional small molecules with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) performance. This represents the first successful example of synthesis of enantioenriched alkylgermanium reagents that permit enantiospecific cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Renewing Halogen Substitution Strategy&#160;for the Rational Design of High&#8208;Curie Temperature Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free molecular antiferroelectric (AFE) holds a promise for energy storage on account of its unique physical attributes. However, it is challenging to explore high&#8208;curie temperature (Tc)&#160;molecular AFEs, due to the lack of design strategies regarding the rise of phase transition energy barriers. By renewing the halogen substitution strategy, we&#160;have&#160;obtained a series of high&#8208;Tc&#160;molecular AFEs of the halogen&#8208;substituted phenethylammonium bromides (x&#8208;PEAB, x&#160;= H/F/Cl/Br), resembling the binary stator&#8208;rotator system. Strikingly, the p&#8208;site halogen substitution of PEA+&#160;cationic rotators raises their phase transition energy barrier&#160;and greatly enhances Tc&#160;up to ~473 K for Br&#8208;PEAB, on par with the record&#8208;high Tc&#160;values for molecular AFEs. As a typical case, the member 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide (F&#8208;PEAB) shows notable AFE properties, including high Tc&#160;(~374 K) and large electric polarization (~3.2 &#956;C/cm2). Further, F&#8208;PEAB also exhibits a high energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 83.6% even around Tc, catching up with other AFE oxides. This renewing halogen substitution strategy in the molecular AFE system provides an effective way to design high&#8208;Tc&#160;AFEs for energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Intracellular Delivery of Antibodies in Cancer Cells with Nanocarriers Sensing Endo/Lysosomal Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The differential enzymatic activity in the endo/lysosomes of particular cells could trigger targeted endosomal escape functions, enabling selective intracellular protein delivery. However, this strategy may be jeopardized due to protein degradation during endosomal trafficking. Herein, using custom made fluorescent probes to assess the endosomal activity of cathepsin B (CTSB) and protein degradation, we found that certain cancer cells with hyperacidified endosomes grant a spatiotemporal window where CTSB activity surpass protein digestion. This inspired the engineering of antibody&#8208;loaded polymeric nanocarriers having CTSB&#8208;activatable endosomal escape ability. The nanocarriers selectively escaped from the endo/lysosomes in the cells with high endosomal CTSB activity and delivered active antibodies to intracellular targets. This study provides a viable strategy for cell&#8208;specific protein delivery using stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers with controlled endosomal escape.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Hollow Nanoporous Carbon Architectures by Controlling MOF Crystalline Inhomogeneity for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) present significant utilitarian value for a wide variety of applications. Facile and efficient preparation of HNCs has long been pursued but still remains challenging. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that single&#8208;component metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals, rather than the widely reported hybrid ones which necessitate tedious operations for preparation, could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of functional HNCs. By controlling the growth kinetics, the MOFs crystals (STU&#8208;1) are readily engineered into different shapes with designated styles of crystalline inhomogeneity. A subsequent one&#8208;step pyrolysis of these MOFs with intraparticle difference can induce a simultaneous self&#8208;hollowing and carbonization process, thereby producing various functional HNCs including yolk&#8208;shell polyhedrons, hollow microspheres, mesoporous architectures, and superstructures. Superior to the existing methods, this synthetic strategy relies only on the complex nature of single&#8208;component MOFs crystals without involving any other constituents and tedious operations, making it convenient, efficient, and easy to scale up. An ultra&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion battery anode is demonstrated by the HNCs with extraordinary cyclability (93% capacity retention over 8000 cycles), highlighting a high level of functionality of the HNCs.</dc:description>

         <title>pKa as a Predictive Descriptor for Electrochemical Anion Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorption of anions onto metal surfaces is important in many applications including effective (electro)catalyst design, metal surface modification, and contaminant removal in wastewater treatment. In electrocatalysis, anions can be both reactive intermediates or site&#8208;blocking spectators, where their adsorption strength therefore dictates the rate of reaction. In this work, we have measured the adsorption energy of a series of carboxylic acids on a Pt (111) single&#8208;crystal electrode surface from aqueous solution. We find that the adsorption strength of the carboxylate anion is linearly correlated with its acid&#8208;dissociation constant (pKa) and therefore the heterolytic O&#8208;H bond dissociation strength in solution. Using density functional theory modeling, we split the anion adsorption energy into a sum of the adsorption energy and electron affinity of a neutral (carboxyl) radical. Surprisingly, the adsorption energy of the carboxyl radicals are similar and therefore the large difference in electron affinity is what dictates anion adsorption strength; the greater the cost in energy to remove the electron from the anion upon adsorption, the weaker its binding. Therefore, at least within a class of anions with similar structure and surface binding atoms, both electron affinity and acidity are predictive descriptors of adsorption strength.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Organic Chiral Crystals with Thermal and Excitation Modulation of the Emission for Information Transmission, Writing, and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic single crystals quickly emerge as dense yet light and nearly defect&#8208;free media for emissive elements. Integration of functionalities and control over the emissive properties are currently being explored for a wide range of these materials to benchmark their performance against organic emissive materials diluted in powders or films. Here, we report mechanically flexible emissive chiral organic crystals capable of an unprecedented combination of fast, reversible, and low&#8208;fatigue responses. UV&#8208;excited single crystals of both enantiomers of the material, 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(((1&#8208;phenylidene) imino) methyl) phenol, exhibit a drastic yet reversible change in the emission color from green to orange&#8208;yellow within a second and can be cycled at least 2000 cycles. The photoresponse was found to depend strongly on the excitation intensity and temperature. Combining chirality, mechanical compliance, rapid emission switching, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, this material provides a unique and versatile platform for developing organic crystal&#8208;based materials for on&#8208;demand signal transfer, information storage and cryptography.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Trifluoroborate Additive for Simultaneous Carrier Dynamics Governance and Defects Passivation to Boost Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main obstacles to promoting the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) include their record power conversion efficiency (PCE), which still remains below the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit, and poor long&#8208;term stability, attributable to crystallographic defects in perovskite films and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss in devices. In this study, potassium (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylpiperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) methyl trifluoroborate (PTFBK) was employed as a multifunctional additive to target and modulate bulk perovskite defects and carrier dynamics of PSCs. Apart from simultaneously passivating anionic and cationic defects, PTFBK could also optimize the energy&#8208;level alignment of devices and weaken&#160;the interaction between carriers and longitudinal optical phonons, resulting in a carrier lifetime of greater than 3 &#181;s. Furthermore, it inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved the crystallization capacity in the target perovskite film. Hence, the target rigid and flexible p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs yielded champion PCEs of 24.99% and 23.48%, respectively. More importantly, due to hydrogen bonding between formamidinium and fluorine, the target devices exhibited remarkable thermal, humidity, and operational tracking at maximum power point stabilities. The reduced Young's modulus and residual stress in the perovskite layer also provided excellent bending stability for flexible target devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Flavins Photochemical Activity in Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Triplet Sensitization through Ring&#8208;Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isoalloxazine heterocycle of flavin cofactors reacts with various nucleophiles to form covalent adducts with important functions in enzymes. Molecular flavin models allow for the characterization of such adducts and the study of their properties. A fascinating set of reactions occurs when flavins react with hydroxide base, which leads to imidazolonequinoxalines, ring&#8208;contracted flavins, with so far unexplored activity. We report a systematic study of the photophysical properties of this new chromophore by absorption and emission spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Excited, ring&#8208;contracted flavins are significantly stronger hydrogen atom abstractors when compared to the parent flavins, which allowed the direct trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic methine positions (bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 400.8 kJ&#8226;mol&#8208;1). In an orthogonal activity, their increased triplet energy (E(S0&#8592;T1) = 244 kJ&#8226;mol&#8208;1) made sensitized reactions possible which exceeded the power of standard flavins. Combining both properties, ring&#8208;contracted flavin catalysts enabled the one&#8208;pot, five&#8208;step transformation of &#945;&#8208;tropolone into trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentanones. We envision this new class of flavin&#8208;derived chromophores to open up new modes of reactivity that are currently impossible with unmodified flavins.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of the First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Inhibitors of Hypoxia Up&#8208;Regulated Protein 1 (HYOU1) Suppressing Pathogenic Fibroblast Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fibroblasts are key regulators of inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. Targeting their activation in these complex diseases has emerged as a novel strategy to restore tissue homeostasis. Here, we present a multidisciplinary lead discovery approach to identify and optimize small molecule inhibitors of pathogenic fibroblast activation. The study encompasses medicinal chemistry, molecular phenotyping assays, chemoproteomics, bulk RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis, target validation experiments and chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET)/Pharmacokinetic (PK)/in vivo evaluation. The parallel synthesis employed for the production of the new benzamide derivatives enabled us to a) pinpoint key structural elements of the scaffold that provide potent fibroblast&#8208;deactivating effects in cells, b) discriminate atoms or groups that favor or disfavor a desirable ADMET profile, and c) identify metabolic &#8220;hot spots&#8221;. Furthermore, we report the discovery of the first&#8208;in&#8208;class inhibitor leads for Hypoxia up&#8208;regulated protein 1 (HYOU1), a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family often associated with cellular stress responses, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Targeting HYOU1 may therefore represent a potentially novel strategy to modulate fibroblast activation and treat chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>The Photosalient Effect and Thermochromic Luminescence Based on o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Assisted &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Crystalline State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report unique multiple&#8208;stimuli responsiveness of anthracene&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We designed and synthesized anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions and numbers of the o&#8208;carborane units. Two compounds had the characteristic crystal structure involving the columnar &#960;&#8208;stacking structures of the anthracene units. From the analysis of crystalline&#8208;state structure&#8208;property relationships, it was revealed that the crystals exhibit the photosalient effect accompanied with photochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reactions and temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical dual&#8208;emission properties including excimer emission of anthracene. Those properties were considered as non&#8208;radiative and radiative deactivation pathways through the excimer formation in the excited state and formation of those species was facilitated by the &#960;&#8208;stacking structure of anthracene units. Moreover, we found unusual temperature dependency of the occurrence of the photosalient effect. According to the data from variable temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography, the strong correlation between lattice shrinkage and strain accumulation is suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fundamental Disorder Unit in (Si, P)&#8211;(O, N) Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis and characterization of oxonitridosilicate phosphates Sr3SiP3O2N7, Sr5Si2P4ON12, and Sr16Si9P9O7N33 as the first of their kind. These compounds were synthesized under high&#8208;temperature (1400&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;pressure (3&#160;GPa) conditions. A unique structural feature is their common fundamental building unit, a vierer single chain of (Si,&#160;P)(O, N)4 tetrahedra. All tetrahedra comprise substitutional disorder which is why we refer to it as the fundamental disorder unit (FDU). We classified four different FDU motifs, revealing systematic bonding patterns. Including literature known Sr5Si2P6N16, three of the four patterns were found in the presented compounds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), elemental analyses, and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were utilized for structural analysis. Additionally, low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations (LCC) provided insights into the structure of Sr16Si9P9O7N33 where NMR data were unavailable due to the lack of bulk samples. The optical properties of these compounds, when doped with Eu2+, were investigated using photoluminescence excitation (PLE), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Factors influencing the emission properties, including thermal quenching mechanisms, were discussed. This research reveals the new class of oxonitridosilicate phosphates with unique systematic structural features that offer potential for theoretical studies of luminescence and band gap tuning in insulators.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensionally Extended Metal&#8211;Organic Ladder Compound Exhibiting Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ladder systems situated in the dimensional crossover region have attracted much attention because their electronic states and physical properties depend strongly on the electronic correlations among the constituent legs. Generally, two&#8208;/three&#8208;legged transition metal&#8208;oxide ladder compounds are studied as representative ladder systems, but two&#8208;/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) extensions based on such ladder systems with a few numbers of legs are difficult because of the extreme synthesis conditions. Here, for the first time, we report the successful creation of a 3D extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound, [Pt(en)(dpye)I]2(NO3)4&#183;2H2O (en = ethylenediamine; dpye = 1,2&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane), which is obtained by simple oxidative polymerization of a small Pt macrocyclic complex using elemental I2. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of 1D mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt&#8211;I&#8211;Pt&#8211;I&#183;&#183;&#183;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering analyses and optical measurements revealed that the out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs. In addition, this compound shows an increase in proton conductivity by a factor of up to 1000, depending on humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir&#8208;Doped CuPd Single&#8208;Crystalline mesoporous Nanotetrahedrons for Ethylene Glycol Oxidation Electrocatalysis: Enhanced Selective Cleavage of C&#8212;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed a facile aqueous synthesis of Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for promoting oxidation cleavage of C&#8212;C bond in alkaline EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) electrocatalysis. The electrocatalyst synthesis relied on precise reduction/co&#8208;nucleation and epitaxial growth of Ir, Cu and Pd precursors with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra Br&#8208; as the facet&#8208;selective agent under ambient conditions. The products featured concave nanotetrahedron morphology enclosed by well&#8208;defined (111) facets, single&#8208;crystalline and mesoporous structure radiated from the center, and uniform elemental composition without any phase separation. Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs disclosed remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability as well as superior selectivity of C1 products for alkaline EGOR electrocatalysis. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrated that performance improvement came from structural and compositional synergies, which kinetically accelerated transports of electrons/reactants within active sites of penetrated mesopores and facilitated oxidation cleavage of high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier C&#8212;C bond of EG for desired C1 products. More interestingly, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed well in coupled electrocatalysis of anode EGOR and cathode nitrate reduction, highlighting its high potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst in various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of Superoxide Radical Intermediate by Polydopamine for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through artificial photosynthesis is a green and promising technology with advantages in sustainability, economy and safety. However, superoxide radical (&#183;O2&#8208;), an important intermediate in photocatalytic oxygen reduction to H2O2 production, has strong oxidizing properties that potentially destabilize the catalyst. Therefore, avoiding the accumulation of &#183;O2&#8208; for its rapid conversion to H2O2 is of paramount significance in improving catalyst stability and H2O2 yield. In this work, a strategy was developed to utilize protonated groups for the rapid depletion of converted &#183;O2&#8208;, thereby the efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 from CN was successfully enhanced by 47&#8208;fold. The experimental findings demonstrated that polydopamine not only improved carrier separation efficiency, and more importantly, provided the adsorption reduction active site for &#183;O2&#8208; for efficient H2O2 production. This work offers a versatile approach for synthesizing efficient and stable photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Precise Synthesis of Diatomic Ir1Pd1&#8208;In2O3 for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol via Angstrom&#8208;Scale&#8208;Distance Dependent Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomically dispersed metal catalysts with full atomic utilization and well&#8208;defined site structure hold great promise for various catalytic reactions. However, the single metallic site limits the comprehensive reaction performance in most reactions. Here, we demonstrated a photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition strategy for the precise synthesis of diatomic Ir1Pd1 on In2O3 applied for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The proximity synergism between diatomic sites enabled a striking promotion in both CO2 conversion (10.5%) and methanol selectivity (97%) with good stability of 100 h run. It resulted in record&#8208;breaking space&#8208;time yield to methanol (187.1 gMeOH gmetal&#8208;1 hour&#8208;1). The promotional effect mainly originated from stronger CO2 adsorption on Ir site with assistance of H&#8208;spillover from Pd site, thus leading to a lower energy barrier for *HCOO pathway. It was confirmed that this synergistic effect strongly depended on the dual&#8208;site distance in an angstrom scale, which was attributed to weaker *H spillover and less electron transfer from Pd to Ir site as the Pd&#8208;to&#8208;Ir distance increased. The average dual&#8208;site distance was evaluated by our firstly proposed photoelectric model. Thus, this study introduced a pioneering strategy to precisely synthesize homonuclear/heteronuclear diatomic catalysts for facilitating the desired reaction route via diatomic synergistic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar Aromatic Two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson Halide Perovskites for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar materials with spontaneous polarization (Ps) have emerged as highly promising photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution owing to the Ps&#8208;enhanced photogenerated carrier separation. However, traditional inorganic polar materials often suffer from limitations such as wide bandgaps and poor carrier transport, which hinders their photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency. Here, we rationally synthesized a series of isostructural two&#8208;dimensional (2D) aromatic Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites, namely (2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (2&#8208;APDPI), (3&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (3&#8208;APDPI), and (4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (4&#8208;APDPI), where 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI crystalize in polar space groups with piezoelectric constants (d33) of approximately 40 pm V&#8722;1 and 3&#8208;APDPI adopts a centrosymmetric structure. Strikingly, owing to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI. As a pioneering study, this work provides an efficient approach for exploring new polar photocatalysts and highlights their potential in promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;releasable Mediator In&#8208;situ Repair Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Residual lead iodide (PbI2) is deemed to a double&#8208;edged sword in perovskite film as small amounts of PbI2 are beneficial to the photovoltaic performance, but excessive will cause degradation of photovoltaic performance and stability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ repair strategy has been developed by introducing amine&#8208;releasable mediator (methylammonium pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic, MAPyA) to eliminate over&#8208;residual PbI2 and regulate the crystal quality of perovskite film. Notably, MAPyA can be partially decomposed into methylamine (MA) gas and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic (PyA) during high temperature annealing. The released MA can locally form liquid intermediate phase, facilitating the reconstruction of perovskite microcrystals and residual PbI2. Moreover, the leftover PyA is confirmed to effectively passivate the uncoordinated lead ions in final perovskite film. Based upon this, superior perovskite film with optimized crystal structure and holistic negligible PbI2 is acquired. The assembled device realizes outstanding efficiency of 24.06%, and exhibits a remarkable operational stability that maintaining 87% of its origin efficiency after continuous illumination for 1480 h. And the unencapsulated MAPyA&#8208;treated devices present significant uplift in humidity stability (maintaining ~ 93% of the initial efficiency over 1500 h, 50&#8208;60% relative humidity). Furthermore, the further optimization of this strategy with nanoimprint technology proves its superiority in the amplificative preparation for perovskite films.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Dimerized Giant Acceptors with Different Alkyl&#8208;Linked Sites for Stable and 19.13% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both high power conversion efficiency (PCE)&#160;and device stability is a major challenge for the practical&#160;development&#160;of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three non&#8208;fully conjugated dimerized giant acceptors (named 2Y&#8208;sites, including wing&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;wing, core&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;core, and end&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;end) are developed. They share the similar monomer precursors but have different alkyl&#8208;linked sites, offering the fine&#8208;tuned molecular absorption, packing,&#160;glass transition temperature, and carrier mobility. Among their binary active layers, D18/2Y&#8208;wing has better miscibility, leading to optimized morphology and more efficient charge transfer&#160;compared to D18/2Y&#8208;core and D18/2Y&#8208;end. Therefore, the D18/2Y&#8208;wing&#8208;based OSCs&#160;achieve a superior PCE of 17.73%, attributed to enhanced photocurrent&#160;and fill factor. Furthermore, the D18/2Y&#8208;wing&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a balance of high PCE and improved stability, distinguishing them within the 2Y&#8208;sites. Building on the success of 2Y&#8208;wing in binary systems, we extend its application to ternary OSCs by pairing it with the near&#8208;infrared absorbing D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F host. Thanks to the complementary absorption within 300&#8208;970 nm and further optimized morphology, ternary OSCs obtain a higher PCE of 19.13%, setting a new efficiency benchmark for the dimer&#8208;derived OSCs. This approach of alkyl&#8208;linked site engineering for constructing dimerized giant acceptors presents a&#160;promising pathway to improve both PCE and stability of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Ru(BINAP)(PPh3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru(BINAP)(PPh3)HCl cleanly reacts with LiCH2TMS to give Ru(BINAP)(PPh3) (1) that has been fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction (BINAP and TMS stand for (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphi&#8208;no)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl and trimethylsilyl respectively). In sharp contrast with other carbonyl&#8208;free phosphine complexes of Ru(0), 1 demonstrates a strikingly high thermal stability and no propensity for intramolecular C&#8211;H activation (cyclometalation). Yet 1 coordinates acetonitrile and readily exchanges its PPh3 ligand with alkenes and dienes, thus behaving like a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;e Ru(0) species. Electron&#8208;poor alkenes coordinate more readily than electron&#8208;rich ones, which testifies for the nucleophilic character of the Ru(0)&#8208;BINAP fragment. While being thermally stable, 1 is highly reactive and is capable of activating C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H bonds, and even of cleaving an inert N&#8211;Et bond. The combination of high reactivity and stability originates from the P,arene&#8208;chelation by the BINAP ligand, i.e., the coordinated &#960;&#8208;arene stabilizes Ru(0) to prevent cyclometalation, yet it can slide upon substrate coordination, thereby enabling a variety of inert bond activation reactions to occur under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries via Regulated Photo&#8208;Induced Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries utilize light to boost capacity but face cycling instability due to complex charge/ion transfer under illumination. This study identified photo&#8208;induced proton transfer (photo&#8208;induced PT) as a significant process in photo&#8208;(dis)charging of widely&#8208;used V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries, contributing to enhanced capacity under illumination but jeopardizing photo&#8208;stability. Photo&#8208;induced PT occurs at 100 ps after photo&#8208;excitation, inducing rapid proton extraction into V2O5 photoelectrode. This process creates a proton&#8208;deficient microenvironment on surface, leading to repetitive cathode dissolution and anode corrosion in each cycle. Enabling the intercalated protons from photo&#8208;induced PT to be reversibly employed in charge&#8208;discharge processes via the anode&#8208;alloying strategy achieves high photo&#8208;stability for the battery. Consequently, a ~54% capacity enhancement was achieved in a V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion battery under illumination, with ~90% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This extends the photo&#8208;stability record by 10 times. This study offers promising advancements in energy storage by addressing instability issues in photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Thermally Conductive Aramid Nanofiber Composite Films with Synchronous Visible/Infrared Camouflages and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;highly thermally conductive composites that combine visible light/infrared camouflage and information encryption has been endowed with great significance in facilitating the application of 5G communication technology in military fields. This work uses aramid nanofibers (ANF) as the matrix, hetero&#8208;structured silver nanowires@boron nitride nanosheets (AgNWs@BNNS) prepared by in&#8208;situ growth as fillers, which are combined to fabricate sandwich structured thermally conductive and electrically insulating (BNNS/ANF)&#8208;(AgNWs@BNNS)&#8208;(BNNS/ANF) (denoted as BAB) composite films by &#8220;filtration self&#8208;assembly, air spraying, and hot&#8208;pressing&#8221; method. When the mass ratio of AgNWs@BNNS to BNNS is 1:1 and the total mass fraction is 50 wt%, BAB composite film has the maximum in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;&#8741; of 10.36 W/(m&#183;K)), excellent electrical insulation (breakdown strength and volume resistivity of 41.5 kV/mm and 1.21&#215;1015 &#937;&#183;cm, respectively) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 170.9 MPa). 50 wt% BAB composite film could efficiently reduce the equilibrium temperature of the central processing unit (CPU) working at full power, resulting in 7.0oC lower than that of the CPU solely integrated with ANF directly. In addition, BAB composite film boasts adaptive visible light/infrared dual camouflage properties on cement roads and jungle environments, as well as the function of fast encryption of QR code information within 24 seconds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing high connectivity (&gt;8) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards new topologies and functions remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in getting high connectivity organic building blocks. This however represents the most important step towards promoting the diversity of COFs due to the still limited dynamic covalent bonds available for constructing COFs at this stage. Herein, highly connected phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) 3D COFs MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs (M = H2, Ni) were afforded from the reaction between 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine M(TAPc) (M = H2, Ni) and 5,5',5'',5''',5'''',5'''''&#8208;(triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexayl)hexa(isophthalohydrazide) (THHI) with 12 connecting sites. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis together with theoretical simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveals their crystalline nature with an unprecedented non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology. Experimental and theoretical investigations disclose the broadened visible light absorption range and narrow optical band gap of MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs. This in combination with their 3D nanochannels endows them with efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O via 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and 2e&#8722; water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 400 nm). This work provides valuable result for the development of high connectivity functional COFs towards diverse application potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching from Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Single Crystals for Low&#8208;Threshold Laser to Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence in Amorphous&#8208;Film for Highly Efficient OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires of tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (DtCzBF2) enabled thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and low&#8208;threshold microlasers. In contrast, its guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films exhibited organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) with a PLQY up to 61&#8201;%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with external quantum efficiency approaching 18.6&#8201;%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes containing Ir or Pt are work horse in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons in electroluminescence (EL) owing to strong heavy&#8208;atom effect. Recently, organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) have achieved high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in rigid crystalline state, which, however, is unsuitable for OLED fabrication, therefore leading to an EL efficiency far low behind those of metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes. Here, we reported a luminescence mechanism switch from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in single crystal microwires to ORTP in amorphous thin&#8208;films, based on a tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate derivative of DtCzBF2. Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires exhibit aggregation induced emission (AIE), enabling TADF microlasers at 473&#8197;nm with an optical gain coefficient as high as 852&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, loosely packed dimers of DtCzBF2 formed in guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films decrease the oscillator strength of fluorescence transition but stabilize triplets for ORTP with a PLQY up to 61&#8201;%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with EQE approaching 20&#8201;%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).

meso&#8211;meso, &#946;&#8211;&#946;, &#946;&#8211;&#946; Triply&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8211;norcorrole hybrids and meso&#8211;meso singly&#8208;linked hybrids were synthesized through intramolecular homocoupling of precursors, respectively. The molecular structures of porphyrin&#8211;norcorrole hybrids have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The triply&#8208;linked hybrid exhibits a warped structure and shows a significantly small electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45&#8197;eV). Furthermore, the triply&#8208;linked hybrid displays singlet diradical characteristics.







Abstract
Norcorrole Ni(II) complexes have recently received considerable attention because they are readily accessible antiaromatic molecules. Their high stability under ambient conditions and ease of synthesis have enabled the exploration of the intrinsic properties of antiaromatic molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of meso&#8211;meso singly linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrids and a triply linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrid. The singly linked and triply linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrids were fully characterized, including an X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Due to their orthogonal conformation, the singly linked hybrids maintain the individual electronic properties of their porphyrin and norcorrole subunits, while the triply linked hybrid shows a significantly smaller electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45&#8197;eV) than that of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole (1.08&#8197;eV). Furthermore, the triply linked hybrid exhibits singlet diradical characteristics, as confirmed by VT&#8197;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments.

         <title>Dopants Induce Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Triarylamine Boronate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purely organic luminescent material TBBU does not show room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state even under N2. When doped with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% DTBU, a persistent yellowish green afterglow can be observed from this binary system in N2 atmosphere. This induced phosphorescence is quite sensitive to oxygen, making the material a candidate for oxygen sensing.







Abstract
Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising candidates for oxygen sensors and information encryption owing to their cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly nature. Herein, we report a bimolecular RTP system where DTBU acts as the guest and TBBU serves as the host. In contrast to previously reported results, we find that both pure DTBU and TBBU do not exhibit RTP in the solid state even under N2 atmosphere. A DTBU/TBBU system with a low doping ratio (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) exhibits persistent yellowish&#8208;green afterglow with a lifetime of 340&#8197;ms and is highly sensitive to oxygen. A DTBU/TBBU system with a higher doping ratio (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) maintains a phosphorescence lifetime of 179&#8197;ms under air. Applications of DTBU/TBBU at varied doping ratios in both oxygen sensing and information encryption are demonstrated. We propose that the T1 state of TBBU acts as an energy transfer intermediate between Tn and T1 of DTBU, ultimately leading to the generation of persistent RTP. Overall, this work demonstrates the critical importance of material purity in the design of RTP systems, and how an understanding of host&#8211;guest doping enables their photophysical properties to be precisely tuned.

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanopiperazines as Specific Covalent Inhibitors of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme UCHL1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanopiperazines as covalent enzyme inhibitors are disclosed. Extending on cyanopyrrolidines, reported cyanamides made of 6&#8208;membered rings display context&#8208;dependent reversibility and exquisite specificity for the deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL1 among human DUBs and the protein deglycase DJ&#8208;1/PARK7. Their mechanism of specificity is rationalized by a crystal structure, highlighting how protein reactivity of electrophilic compounds can be finetuned.







Abstract
Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross&#8208;reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ&#8208;1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl,N&#8208;cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with effective target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5&#8208;membered pyrrolidines to 6&#8208;membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context&#8208;dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound&#8208;induced conformational restriction of the cross&#8208;over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.

However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross-reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ-1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose &lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with effective target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5-membered pyrrolidines to 6-membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context-dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound-induced conformational restriction of the cross-over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Potentiometric Dual&#8208;Channel Microsensor Reveals that Fluctuation of H2S is Less pH&#8208;Dependent During Spreading Depolarization in the Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the mechanism of spreading depolarization (SD) is essential for the therapy of SD associated diseases. We report a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous detection of H2S and pH, enabling the first observation of H2S fluctuation induced by SD in vivo. Our work provides the direct experimental evidence that the H2S release during SD in rat cortex is less pH&#8208;dependent, possibly by modulating enzyme&#8208;dependent pathways.







Abstract
Spreading depolarization (SD) is one of the most common neuropathologic phenomena in the nervous system, relating to numerous diseases. However, real&#8208;time monitoring the rapid chemical changes during SD to probe the molecular mechanism remains a great challenge. We develop a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous monitoring of H2S and pH featuring excellent selectivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this microsensor we first observe real time changes of H2S and pH in the rat brain induced by SD. This changes of H2S are completely suppressed when the rat pre&#8208;treats with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a blocker to inhibit the H2S&#8208;producing enzyme, indicating H2S fluctuation might be related to enzyme&#8208;dependent pathway during SD and less pH&#8208;dependent. This study provides a new perspective for studying the function of H2S and the molecular basis of SD&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Supramolecular Complexation of Metal Oxide Cluster and Non&#8208;Fluorinated Polymer for Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Proton Exchange Membranes for High&#8208;Power&#8208;Density Fuel Cells</title>

The facile and cost&#8208;effective hybridization strategy for proton exchange membranes (PEMs) design by blending 1&#8197;nm metal oxide clusters and polyvinyl butyral. The fuel cells equipped with the PEM show promising power densities and excellent durability that is on par with Nafion&#174; and surpass the previously reported non&#8208;fluorinated PEMs.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective, non&#8208;fluorinated polymer proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are highly desirable in emerging hydrogen fuel cells (FCs) technology; however, their low proton conductivities and poor chemical and dimension stabilities hinder their further development as alternatives to commercial Nafion&#174;. Here, we report the inorganic&#8208;organic hybridization strategy by facilely complexing commercial polymers, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), with inorganic molecular nanoparticles, H3PW12O40 (PW) via supramolecular interaction. The strong affinity among them endows the obtained nanocomposites amphiphilicity and further lead to phase separation for bi&#8208;continuous structures with both inter&#8208;connected proton transportation channels and robust polymer scaffold, enabling high proton conductivities, mechanical/dimension stability and barrier performance, and the H2/O2 FCs equipped with the composite PEM show promising power densities and long&#8208;term stability. Interestingly, the hybrid PEM can be fabricated continuously in large scale at challenging ~10&#8197;&#956;m thickness via typical tape casting technique originated from their facile complexing strategy and the hybrids&#8217; excellent mechanical properties. This work not only provides potential material systems for commercial PEMs, but also raises interest for the research on hybrid composites for PEMs.

         <title>Bridging of Cove Regions: A Strategy for Realizing Persistently Chiral Double Heterohelicenes with Attractive Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The racemization of chiral organic compounds is a common chemical phenomenon. However, it often poses configurational&#8208;stability issues to the application of this class of compounds. Achieving chiral organic compounds without the risk of racemization is fascinating, but it is challenging due to a lack of strategies. Here, we reveal the cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy for achieving persistently chiral multi&#8208;helicenes (incapable of racemization), based on the synthesized proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept double hetero[4]helicenes featuring macrocycle structures with a small 3D cavity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the strategy is also effective in tuning the electronic structures of multi&#8208;helicenes, resulting in a conversion from luminescence silence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for the present system. Furthermore, red circularly polarized TADF based on small double[4]helicene systems is achieved for the first time using this strategy. The disclosed cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy provides an opportunity to modulate the electronic structures and luminescent properties of multi&#8208;helicenes without concern for racemization, thus significantly enhancing the structural and property diversity of multi&#8208;helicenes for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Thiophene Based Conjugated Polymer Cathode with High Capacity for Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage materials due to their environmental friendliness and sustainable renewability. However, problems such as their high solubility in electrolytes and low intrinsic conductivity have always plagued their further application. Polymerization to form conjugated organic polymers can not only inhibit the dissolution of organic electrodes in the electrolyte, but also enhance the intrinsic conductivity of organic molecules. Herein, we synthesized a new conjugated organic polymer (COPs) COP500&#8208;CuT2TP (poly [5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl) porphyrinato] copper (II)) by electrochemical polymerization method. Due to the self&#8208;exfoliation behavior, the porphyrin cathode exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 420 mAh g&#8208;1, and a high specific energy of 900 Wh Kg&#8208;1 with a first coulombic efficiency of 96% at 100 mA g&#8208;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000 cycles without capacity loss was achieved even at a high current density of 5 A g&#8208;1. This highly conjugated structure promotes COP500&#8208;CuT2TP combined high energy density, high power density, and good cycling stability, which would open new opportunity for the designable and versatile organic electrodes for electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>One or two phenylacetylide (PA) ligand(s) were successfully removed from the IrAu12 superatomic core of [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)2]+ (dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) by reaction with controlled amounts of tetrafluoroboric acid. Optical and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations revealed the formation of open Au site(s) on the IrAu12 core of [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)1]2+ and [IrAu12(dppe)5]3+ with the remaining structure intact. Isocyanide was efficiently trapped at the open electrophilic site on [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)1]2+, whereas a dimer or trimer of the IrAu12 superatoms was formed using diisocyanide as a linker. These results open the door to designed assembly of chemically modified metal superatoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Zn&#8208;ion Electrochromic Batteries with Multiple&#8208;color Variations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochromic batteries as emerging smart energy devices are highly sought after owing to their real&#8208;time energy monitoring through visual color conversion. However, their large&#8208;scale applicability is hindered by insufficient capacity, inadequate cycling stability, and limited color variation. Herein, a flexible Zn&#8208;ion electrochromic battery (ZIEB) was assembled with sodium vanadate (VONa+) cathode, ion&#8208;redistributing hydrogel electrolyte, and Zn anode to address these challenges. The electrolyte contains anchored &#8208;SO3&#8208;&#160;and &#8208;NH3+, which facilitates ionic transportation and prevents Zn dendrite formation by promoting orientated Zn2+&#160;deposition on the Zn (002) surface. The ZIEB exhibits a continuous reversible color transition, ranging from fully charged orange to mid&#8208;charged brown and drained green. It also demonstrates a high specific capacity of 302.4 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.05 A&#183;g&#8208;1&#160;with a capacity retention of 96.3% after 500 cycles at 3 A&#183;g&#8208;1.&#160;Additionally, the ZIEB maintains stable energy output even under bending, rolling, knotting, and twisting. This work paves a new strategy for the design of smart energy devices in wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Organic Polymer as Multifunctional Interfacial Layers for Ultra&#8208;Long Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatal issues in lithium metal anodes (LMA), such as detrimental lithium dendrites growth and fragile solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the Li plating/stripping process, often hinder the practical application of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, cobalt&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer&#160;(Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP) is constructed as&#160;the protective layer for regulating the interface stability of LMA. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C&#160;linkage, C=N units,&#160;aromatic rings)&#160;and Co sites not only regulate the Li+&#160;coordination environment and rearrange Li+&#160;concentration to facilitate its transport by optimizing the electronic density,&#160;enhancing the compatibility with electrolyte interface and&#160;supplying &#8220;external magnetic driving strategy&#8221;, but also strengthens the interfacial stiffness with high Young&#8217;s modulus to better withstand the mechanical stress. These beneficial effects and relative underlying working mode and mechanism of the uniform Li plating and rapid Li+ migration on the Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP are also revealed by various in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ&#160;experimental technologies and theory calculation. The Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP&#8208;based cell delivers an extraordinary lifespan of 6600 h and ultrahigh capacity retention of 78.3% (111.9 mAh g&#8208;1) after 1000 cycles&#160;at 1 C. This demonstrated synergistic strategy in Co&#8208;coordinated organic polymer may gain new insights to regulate the uniform and non&#8208;dendritic deposition/dissolution behaviors&#160;for highly stable LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Weakly Solvating Electrolyte towards Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra&#8208;low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion&#8208;dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+&#8208;dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic&#8208;rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of &#8208;83.3&#176;C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1 at &#8208;40 and &#8208;60&#176;C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at &#8208;40&#176;C. This work sheds new lights on the ion&#8208;dipole regulation for ultra&#8208;low temperature SIBs.</dc:description>

However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3&#176;C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60&#176;C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40&#176;C.

         <title>Bidirectional neuronal actuation by uncaging with violet and green light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a photochemical protecting group that enables wavelength selective uncaging using green versus violet light. Change of the exocyclic oxygen of the laser dye coumarin&#8208;102 to sulfur, gave thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102, a new chromophore with an absorption ratio at 503/402 nm of 37. Photolysis of thio&#8208; coumarin&#8208;102 caged &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid was found to be highly selective on neurons, with normalized electrical responses &gt; 100&#8208; fold higher in the green versus violet channel. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102 caged glutamate, we could use whole cell violet and green irradiation to fire and block neuronal action potentials with complete orthogonality. Localized irradiation of different dendritic segments on the same neuron, in concert with 3&#8208;dimenional Ca2+ imaging, revealed that such inputs could function independently. Chemical signaling in living cells always involves a complex balance of multiple pathways, use of (thio)&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged compounds will enable arbitrarily timed flashes of green and violet light to interrogate two independent pathways simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst [Co2O2] Metallacycle Enables Regioselective Allene C(sp2)&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H is an ideal approach to upgrading simple allenes to synthetically useful allenes, albeit suffering from challenges associated with inert reactivity and inferior selectivity. Inspired by energy chemistry, a catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy was leveraged to selectively activate weakly acidic allene C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds in a reductive mode. An array of [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes were readily devised starting from amino acids, and they were demonstrated as robust HER catalysts, which would selectively break allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds to release hydrogen. With the newly developed HER catalyst, regioselective electrochemical functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H with alcoholic &#945; C(sp3)&#8208;H was unprecedentedly achieved. This strategy features excellent regioselectivity, unconventional chemoselectivity, good functional&#8208;group tolerance (62 examples), and mild conditions. Mechanism experiments revealed a reactive hydroxy&#8208;coordinated cobalt(II) species in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to rationalize the regioselectivity observed in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 coupling of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent was developed to afford enantioenriched trifluoromethylthiolated molecules. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
In contrast with the well&#8208;established C(sp2)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling to forge the Ar&#8722;SCF3 bond, the corresponding enantioselective coupling of readily available alkyl electrophiles to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 bond has remained largely unexplored. We herein disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 coupling of a range of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands through tuning electronic and steric effects for the simultaneous control of the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity. This strategy can successfully realize two types of asymmetric radical reactions, including enantioconvergent C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling of racemic benzyl halides and three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;carbotrifluoromethylthiolation of arylated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. It therefore provides a highly flexible platform for the rapid assembly of an array of enantioenriched SCF3&#8208;containing molecules of interest in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Ultrastrong Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Uranium&#8208;Organic Frameworks Leading to Inverse Luminescence Temperature Dependence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consistent, crystalline, and oriented uranium&#8208;based MOF thin film was devised by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique. The materials exhibited a noticeable phonon&#8208;assisted temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and presented two unusual thermal&#8208;activated emission bands (&#8220;hot&#8208;band&#8221;). A single&#8208;metal ratiometric optical thermometer was designed relying on this uranium&#8208;based MOF thin films and it exhibited exceptional thermal sensitivity.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;phonon interactions, crucial in condensed matter, are rarely seen in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Detecting these interactions typically involves analyzing luminescence in lanthanide&#8208; or actinide&#8208;based compounds. Prior studies on Ln&#8208; and Ac&#8208;based MOFs at high temperatures revealed additional peaks, but these were too faint for thorough analysis. In our research, we fabricated a high&#8208;quality, crystalline uranium&#8208;based MOF (KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1) thin film using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. Under UV light, this film showed two distinct &#8220;hot bands,&#8221; indicating a strong electron&#8208;phonon interaction. At 77&#8197;K, these bands were absent, but at 300&#8197;K, a new emission band appeared with half the intensity of the main luminescence. Surprisingly, a second hot band emerged above 320&#8197;K, deviating from previous findings in rare&#8208;earth compounds. We conducted a detailed ab&#8208;initio analysis employing time&#8208;dependent density functional theory to understand this unusual behaviour and to identify the lattice vibration responsible for the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1 film's hot&#8208;band emission was then utilized to create a highly sensitive, single&#8208;compound optical thermometer. This underscores the potential of high&#8208;quality MOF thin films in exploiting the unique luminescence of lanthanides and actinides for advanced applications.

         <title>Resolving the Origins of Superior Cycling Performance of Antimony Anode in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Comparison with Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic comparative study on the electrochemical performance and dynamic microstructural and mechanical changes of antimony anode in storing Li+/Na+ cations was carried out by combining in situ microscopic and spectroscopic analysis, density functional theory simulations, and finite&#8208;element analysis. Full stepwise crystal transition with large lattice strains has been witnessed in Li&#8208;storage system, while an unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/de&#8208;alloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as intermediates is discovered in Na&#8208;storage system, featuring enhanced resilience and less strain, contributing to high capacities and superior cyclability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02&#8197;&#197;) than Li+ (0.76&#8197;&#197;), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to the lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na&#8722;Sb alloys than Li&#8722;Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large&#8208;volume&#8208;change electrode materials.

         <title>Alkene Thianthrenation Unlocks Diverse Cation Synthons: Recent Progress and New Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of alkenes into thianthrene&#8208;derived cationic electrophiles unlocks a suite of net oxidative alkene transformations that have been elusive using conventional strategies. These linchpin intermediates can be generated selectively and undergo a diverse array of mechanistically distinct reactions with abundant nucleophiles.







Abstract
Oxidative alkene functionalization reactions are a fundamental class of complexity&#8208;building organic transformations. However, the majority of established approaches rely on electrophilic reagents that limit the diversity of groups that can be installed. Recent advances have established a new approach that instead relies on the transformation of alkenes into thianthrene&#8208;derived cationic electrophiles. These linchpin intermediates can be generated selectively and undergo a diverse array of mechanistically distinct reactions with abundant nucleophiles. Taken together, this unlocks a suite of net oxidative alkene transformations that have been elusive using conventional strategies. This Minireview describes these advances and is organized around the three distinct synthons formally accessible from alkenes via thianthrenation: 1) alkenyl cations; 2) vicinal dications; 3) allyl cations. Throughout the Minireview, we illustrate how thianthrenium salts address key limitations endemic to classic alkene&#8208;derived electrophiles and highlight the mechanistic origins of these distinctions wherever possible.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We outline the recent progress on bulk and thin&#8208;film metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in the context of their electrical properties and related electronic device configurations. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the electrical conductivity of MOFs are emphasized.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano&#8208;porous materials made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&#8722;7&#8211;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and surface&#8208;anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for MOFs&#8208;based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review highlights the pros and cons of MOFs&#8208;based electronics (MOFtronics), followed by an analysis of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and result in improved devices performance.

In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and surface-anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for MOFs-based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review highlights the pros and cons of MOFs-based electronics (MOFtronics), followed by an analysis of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and result in improved devices performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Charge Carrier Dynamics on Sb2Se3 Photocathodes for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photoelectrochemical ammonia production from NO3 reduction reaction can be achieved by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency of 88.01&#8201;% and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;VRHE. It provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is recognized as a transportable carrier for renewable energy fuels. Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) offers a sustainable solution for nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater treatment by directly converting solar energy to ammonia. In this study, we demonstrate the highly selective PEC ammonia production from NO3RR by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The constructed CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) of 88.01&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;VRHE and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;VRHE with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;VRHE. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode possesses high light absorption capacity, excellent carrier transfer capability, and high charge separation and transfer efficiencies. The photocathode can effectively adsorb the reactant NO3&#8722; and intermediate, and the CoCu co&#8208;catalyst increases the maximum Gibbs free energy difference between NO3RR and HER. Meanwhile, the Co species enhances the spin density of Cu, and increases the density of states near the Fermi level in pdos, which results in a high PEC NO3RR activity on CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3. This work provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>Synthetic Biology&#8208;based Construction of Unnatural Perylenequinones with Improved Photodynamic Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unnatural perylenequinone cercosporin A is obtained by reprogramming cercosporin assembly line in Cercospora, which displays low dark toxicity and high photostability and maintains great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it shows selective accumulation in cancer cells. Thus, this work provides a remarkable concept for preparing unnatural products with the desired functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies.







Abstract
The construction of structural complexity and diversity of natural products is crucial for drug discovery and development. To overcome high dark toxicity and poor photostability of natural photosensitizer perylenequinones (PQs) for photodynamic therapy, herein, we aim to introduce the structural complexity and diversity to biosynthesize the desired unnatural PQs in fungus Cercospora through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategy. Thus, we first elucidate the intricate biosynthetic pathways of class B PQs and reveal how the branching enzymes create their structural complexity and diversity from a common ancestor. This enables the rational reprogramming of cercosporin biosynthetic pathway in Cercospora to generate diverse unnatural PQs without chemical modification. Among them, unnatural cercosporin A displays remarkably low dark toxicity and high photostability with retention of great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it is found that, unlike cercosporin, unnatural cercosporin A could be selectively accumulated in cancer cells, providing potential targets for drug development. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for preparing unnatural products with customized functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies, thus facilitating drug discovery pipelines from nature.

         <title>Transcytosis&#8208;Based Renal Tubular Reabsorption of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a smart surface mimic strategy for exogenous ultrasmall gold nanoparticles to construct protein mimics (P&#8722;AuNPs) and demonstrated that the P&#8722;AuNPs were identical to the endogenous filterable proteins not only in appearance but also in transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption. This surface&#8208;mimicking strategy can stimulate further investigation into many other endogenous metabolic pathways for exogenous substances.







Abstract
Transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of endogenous proteins is a well&#8208;known energy&#8208;saving pathway that prevents nutrient loss. However, utilization of this well&#8208;known reabsorption pathway for the delivery of exogenous nanodrugs remains a challenge. In this study, using the surface mimic strategy of a specific PEPT1/2&#8208;targeted Gly&#8722;Sar peptide as a ligand, renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (P&#8722;AuNPs) were developed as protein mimics to investigate the transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of exogenous substances. By regulating the influential factors (H+ content in tubular lumens and PEPT1/2 transporter counts in tubular cells) of Gly&#8722;Sar&#8208;mediated transcytosis, the specific and efficient interaction between P&#8722;AuNPs and renal tubular cells was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Efficient transcellular transportation significantly guided the reabsorption of P&#8722;AuNPs back into the bloodstream, which enhanced the blood concentration and bioavailability of nanoparticles, contributing to high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging.

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic and Thermocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Propionaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reaction Scheme is demonstrated to convert CO2 to propionaldehyde. By individually optimizing and efficiently coupling the upstream and downstream processes, this hybrid system achieves a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38&#8201;%, considerably higher than the best electrochemical systems alone or other hybrid systems reported earlier.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction can convert CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, but its selectivity toward C3+ products are very limited. One possible solution is to run the reactions in hybrid processes by coupling electrocatalysis with other catalytic routes. In this contribution, we report the cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 to propionaldehyde. Using Cu(OH)2 nanowires as the precatalyst, CO2/H2O is reduced to concentrated C2H4, CO, and H2 gases in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor. The thermochemical hydroformylation reaction is separately investigated with a series of rhodium&#8208;phosphine complexes. The best candidate is identified to be the one with the 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane diphosphine ligand, which exhibits a propionaldehyde turnover number of 1148 under a mild temperature and close&#8208;to&#8208;atmospheric pressure. By coupling and optimizing the upstream CO2 electroreduction and downstream hydroformylation reaction, we achieve a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38&#8201;% and a total C3 oxygenate selectivity of 44&#8201;% based on reduced CO2. These values represent a more than seven times improvement over the best prior electrochemical system alone or over two times improvement over other hybrid systems.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar cells Enabled by Manipulating the Intermolecular Interactions through Side Chain Fluorine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine side chain functionalization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) represents an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, a knowledge gap persists regarding the relationship between structural changes induced by fluorine functionalization and the resultant impact on device performance. In this work, varying amounts of fluorine atoms were introduced into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs to construct two acceptors named BTP&#8208;F0 and BTP&#8208;F5. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that side&#8208;chain fluorination significantly increase the overall average electrostatic potential (ESP) and charge balance factor, thereby effectively improving the ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular electrostatic interaction, and thus precisely tuning the molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Therefore, the BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based OSC exhibited enhanced crystallinity, domain purity, reduced domain spacing, and optimized phase distribution in the vertical direction, facilitating exciton diffusion, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. Consequently, the promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3% and 19.2% were achieved in BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices, respectively, surpassing the PCE of 16.1% for BTP&#8208;F0&#8208;based OSCs. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and demonstrates that fluorine functionalization of the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs is a compelling strategy for achieving ideal phase separation for highly efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>sp3&#8208;Rich Heterocycle Synthesis on DNA: Application to DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA encoded library (DEL) synthesis represents a convenient means to produce, annotate and store large collections of compounds in a small volume. While DELs are well suited for drug discovery campaigns, the chemistry used in their production must be compatible with the DNA tag, which can limit compound class accessibility. As a result, most DELs are heavily populated with peptidomimetic and sp2&#8208;rich molecules. Here, we show that sp3&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be made on DNA from ketochlorohydrin aldol products through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxy pyrrolidines possess structural features that are unique among DELs and occupy a distinct region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Retrocyclization of a Mangana(II)cyclopentasilane to Form Manganese(0) Bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand&#8208;exchange reactions on a mangana(II)cyclopentasilane complex that contains two THF ligands with aryl isocyanides led to the formation of manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization. In stark contrast, ligand&#8208;exchange reactions with CNtBu, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, or pyridine&#8208;based ligands furnished manganese(II) complexes wherein the manganacyclopentasilane framework remained intact. The thermolysis of the obtained bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via the formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties. The insertion of a mesityl isocyanide into the Mn&#8211;Sib bond results in the formation of a manganese(II) complex supported by a [SiCSi]&#8208;type tridentate ligand scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Designed Ru(II) Metallacycle as a Microenvironment&#8208;Adaptive Sonosensitizer and Sonocatalyst for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Biofilms Eradication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albeit sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has achieved encouraging progress in microbial sterilization, the scarcity of guidelines for designing highly effective sonosensitizers and the intricate biofilm microenvironment (BME), substantially hamper the therapeutic efficacy against biofilm infections. To address the bottlenecks, we innovatively design a Ru(II) metallacycle&#8208;based sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst (named Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD) to enhance the potency of sonotherapy by employing molecular engineering strategies tailored to BME. Our approach involves augmenting Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD&#8217;s production of ultrasonic&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS), surpassing the performance of commercial sonosensitizers, through a straightforward but potent &#960;&#8208;expansion approach. Within the BME, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD synergistically amplifies sonotherapeutic efficacy via triple&#8208;modulated approaches: (i) effective alleviation of hypoxia, leading to increased ROS generation, (ii) disruption of the antioxidant defense system, which shields ROS from glutathione consumption, and (iii) enhanced biofilm penetration, enabling ROS production in deep sites. Notably, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD sono&#8208;catalytically oxidizes NADPH, a critical coenzyme involved in antioxidant defenses. Consequently, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD demonstrates superior biofilm eradication potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli compared to conventional clinical antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering instance of a supramolecular sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst. It provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship of sonosensitizers and paves a promising pathway for the treatment of biofilm infections.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Conjugated Electrolytes as Biomimetics of Lipid Bilayers for In Vivo Liposome Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes serve as promising and versatile vehicles for drug delivery. Tracking these nanosized vesicles, particularly in vivo, is crucial for understanding their pharmacokinetics. This study introduces the design and synthesis of three new conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecules, which emit in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), facilitating deeper tissue penetration. Additionally, these CEs, acting as biomimetics of lipid bilayers, demonstrate superior compatibility with lipid membranes compared to commonly used carbocyanine dyes like DiR. To counteract the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, CEs employ a twisted backbone, as such their fluorescence intensities can effectively enhance after a fluorophore multimerization strategy. Notably, a &#8220;passive&#8221; method was employed to integrate CEs into liposomes during the liposome formation, and membrane incorporation efficiency was significantly promoted to nearly 100%. To validate the in vivo tracking capability, the CE&#8208;containing liposomes were functionalized with cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptides, serving as tumor&#8208;targeting ligands. Clear fluorescent images visualizing tumor site in living mice were captured by collecting the NIR&#8208;II emission. Uniquely, these CEs exhibit additional emission peak in visible region, enabling in vitro subcellular analysis using routine confocal microscopy. These results underscore the potential of CEs as a new&#8208;generation of membrane&#8208;targeting probes to facilitate the liposome&#8208;based medicine research.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization&#160;and Engineering of Two Highly Paralogous Sesquiterpene Synthases Reveal a Regioselective Reprotonation Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sesquiterpene synthases (STPSs) catalyze carbocation&#8208;driven cyclization reactions that can generate structurally&#160; diverse&#160;hydrocarbons.&#160;The deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation&#160;process&#160;is widely&#160;used&#160;in STPSs to promote structural diversity, largely&#160;attributable&#160;to the&#160;distinct regio/stereoselective reprotonations.&#160;However, the molecular basis for reprotonation regioselectivity remains largely understudied.&#160;Herein,&#160;we analyzed&#160;two highly paralogous&#160;STPSs,&#160;Artabotrys hexapetalus(&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene synthase (AhCS) and ishwarane synthase (AhIS), which catalyze reactions that are distinct from the regioselective protonation of&#160;germacrene A (GA), resulting in distinct skeletons of 5/5/6 tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene and 6/6/5/3 tetracyclic ishwarane, respectively. Isotopic labeling experiments demonstrated that these protonations occur at C3 and C6 in AhCS and AhIS, respectively. The&#160;cryoelectron microscopy&#8208;derived&#160;AhCS complex structure&#160;provided the structural basis for identifying different key active site residues that may govern their functional disparity.&#160;The structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis of these residues resulted in successful functional interconversion between AhCS and AhIS, thus targeting the three active site&#160;residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458]&#160;that may act as a C3/C6 reprotonation switch for GA.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Steric Hindrance and Excited State for Anti&#8208;Quenching and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold great promise for advanced high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays. However, persistent challenges, such as severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and slow spin&#8208;flip, hinder their optimal performance. We propose a synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which is demonstrated by two blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz, bearing steric&#8208;demanding 8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IDAD) and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (TIDAD), respectively. These rigid and bulky IDAD/TIDAD moieties, with appropriate electron&#8208;donating capabilities, not only effectively mitigate ACQ, ensuring efficient luminescence across a broad range of dopant concentrations, but also induce high&#8208;lying charge transfer excited states that facilitate triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip without causing undesired emission redshift or spectral broadening. Consequently, implementation of a high doping level of IDAD&#8208;BNCz resulted in highly efficient narrowband electroluminescence, featuring a remarkable full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34 nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3% and 31.9% at maximum and 100 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. The combined steric and electronic effects arising from the steric&#8208;hindered donor introduction offer a compelling molecular design strategy to overcome critical challenges in MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Facilitates the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror&#8208;Image Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins) are useful in biomedical research for purposes such as mirror&#8208;image screening for D&#8208;peptide drug discovery, but the chemical synthesis of many D&#8208;proteins is often low yielding due to the poor solubility or aggregation of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we report a Lys&#8208;C protease cleavable solubilizing&#8208;tag and its use to synthesize difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain D&#8208;proteins. Our tag is easily installed onto multiple amino acids such as D&#8208;Lys, D&#8208;Ser, D&#8208;Thr and/or the N&#8208;terminal D&#8208;amino acid of hydrophobic peptides, is impervious to various reaction conditions, such as peptide synthesis, ligation, desulfurization, and transition metal&#8208;mediated deprotection, and yet can be completely removed by Lys&#8208;C protease under denaturing conditions to give the desired D&#8208;protein. The efficacy and practicality of the new method were exemplified in the synthesis of two challenging D&#8208;proteins: D&#8208;enantiomers of PD&#8208;1 IgV domain and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein, in high yield. This work demonstrates that the enzymatic cleavage of solubilizing tags under denaturing conditions is feasible, thus paving the way for the production of more challenging D&#8208;proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Coupling for Targeted Synthesis of CH3COOH with Nearly 100% Selectivity from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted synthesis of acetic acid (CH3COOH) from CO2 photoreduction under mild conditions mainly limits by the kinetic challenge of the C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we utilized doping engineering to build charge&#8208;asymmetrical metal pair sites for boosted C&#8722;C coupling, enhancing the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH. As a prototype, the Pd doped Co3O4 atomic layers are synthesized, where the established charge&#8208;asymmetrical cobalt pair sites are verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Theoretical calculations not only reveal the charge&#8208;asymmetrical cobalt pair sites caused by Pd atom doping, but also manifest the promoted C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates through shortening of the coupled C&#8722;C bond distance from 1.54 to 1.52 &#197; and lowering their formation energy barrier from 0.77 to 0.33 eV. Importantly, the decreased reaction energy barrier from the protonation of two*COOH into *CO intermediates for the Pd&#8208;Co3O4 atomic layer slab is 0.49 eV, higher than that of the Co3O4 atomic layer slab (0.41 eV). Therefore, the Pd&#8208;Co3O4 atomic layers exhibit the CH3COOH evolution rate of ca. 13.8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with near 100% selectivity, both of which outperform all previously reported single photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH under similar conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Crystallinity of Keto&#8208;enamine Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through an in situ Protection&#8208;Deprotection Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>b&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as highly robust materials, showing significant potential for practical applications. However, the exclusive reliance on 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (Tp aldehyde) in the design of such COFs, often results in the production of non&#8208;porous amorphous polymers when combined with certain amine building blocks. The attempts to adjust crystallinity and porosity with the modulator approach are inefficient because Tp aldehyde readily forms stable b&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked monomers/oligomers with various aromatic amines through an irreversible keto&#8208;enol tautomerization process. Our research employed a unique protection&#8208;deprotection strategy to enhance the crystallinity and porosity of b&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked squaramide&#8208;based 2D COFs. Advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies, including 1D 13C CPMAS, 1H fast MAS, 15N CPMAS, 2D 13C&#8208;1H correlation, 1H&#8208;1H DQ&#8208;SQ, and 14N&#8208;1H HMQC NMR were used to establish the atomic&#8208;level connectivity within the resultant COFs. The TpOMe&#8208;Sqm COFs synthesized utilizing this strategy have a surface area of 487 m2g&#8208;1, significantly higher than similar COFs synthesized using Tp aldehyde. Furthermore, detailed time&#8208;dependent PXRD, solid&#8208;state 13C CPMAS NMR, and theoretical DFT studies shed more light on the crystallization and linkage conversion processes in these 2D COFs. Ultimately, we applied this protection&#8208;deprotection methodology to construct novel keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked highly porous organic polymers with a surface area of 1018 m2g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Descriptor&#8208;Based Volcano Relations Predict Single Atoms for Hydroxylamine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an important feedstock in fuels, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Nanostructured electrocatalysts drive green electrosynthesis of hydroxylamine from nitrogen oxide species in water. However, current electrocatalysts still suffer from low selectivity and manpower&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error modes, leaving unclear selectivity/activity origins and a lack of catalyst design principles. Herein, we theoretically analyze key determinants of selectivity/activity and propose the adsorption energy of NHO (Gad(*NHO)) as a performance descriptor. A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior NH2OH selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict a series of SACs and discover Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. These theoretical prediction results are also confirmed by experimental results, rationalizing our Gad(*NHO) descriptor. Furthermore, Mn&#8208;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proved to enhance NH2OH formation.</dc:description>

Elucidating the solvation structure of LiPSs is the first step for rational design of electrolyte and improving Li&#8211;S battery performances. Herein, we investigate the solvation structure of LiPSs and find that Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of LiPSs and form contact ion pairs in electrolyte. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. In particular, the LiPS solvation structure modified by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide endows Li&#8211;S batteries with reduced polarization and enhanced rate performances under high sulfur areal loading and lean electrolyte volume conditions. This work updates the fundamental understanding of the solvation chemistry of LiPSs and highlights electrolyte engineering for promoting the performances of Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Coherent Modulation of the Aggregation Behavior and Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Small Molecule Probes for Sensitive and Long&#8208;term Nerve Agent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) shows promising performance in chemical sensing relying on the change of the emission behavior of the probe molecule monomers to the aggregated product. However, whether the response contrast could be further boosted by utilizing the emission property of the aggregated probe and the aggregated product remains a big challenge. Here, an exciting AIE probe regulation strategy was proposed by coherently modulating the aggregation behavior and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) property of the probes and thus an aggregated&#8208;to&#8208;aggregated colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection was achieved. The blue emissive film obtained with the optimal AIE probe has been proven to be effective to recognize the vapor of nerve agent analog DCP in air by emitting a sharp green fluorescence. In addition, a porous polymer&#8208;based wet sensing chip loaded with the probe enables the immediate response to DCP vapor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7 ppb, and it was further integrated into a wearable watch device for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP vapor up to two weeks. We expect the present probe design strategy would greatly deepen the AIE&#8208;based science and provide new insights for long&#8208;term monitoring sensors toward trace hazardous substances.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of TNA Protects DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs) are synthetic genetic polymers with improved biological stabilities and offer powerful molecular tools such as aptamers and catalysts. However, XNA application has been hindered by a very limited repertoire of tool enzymes, particularly those that enable de novo XNA synthesis. Here we report that terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) catalyzes untemplated threose nucleic acid (TNA) synthesis at the 3&#8217; terminus of DNA oligonucleotide, resulting in DNA&#8208;TNA chimera resistant to exonuclease digestion. Moreover, TdT&#8208;catalyzed TNA extension supports one&#8208;pot batch preparation of biostable chimeric oligonucleotides, which can be used directly as staples during self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). Such TNA&#8208;protected DONs show enhanced biological stability in the presence of exonuclease I, DNase I and fetal bovine serum. This work not only expands the available enzyme toolbox for XNA synthesis and manipulation, but also provides a promising approach to fabricate DONs with improved stability under the physiological condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Macrocyclization towards Crown Ethers Using Hydroamination of Bis(allenes)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crown ethers (CE) are indispensable building blocks in supramolecular chemistry, coordination chemistry, catalysis and material science. Enantiomerically enriched CEs exhibit strong asymmetric induction in phase transfer catalysis, supramolecular catalysis and molecular recognition processes. Traditional methods (using chiral substrates) have often been used to access these valuable compounds, which limit their diversity and consequently their applicability. Thus, notwithstanding the ubiquitous applications of chiral CEs, their catalytic and stereoselective synthesis has remained basically unexplored. Herein, a practical catalytic method is described for the gram scale synthesis of a class of chiral CEs (aza&#8208;crown ethers; ACEs) using rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines. This diversity oriented synthetic approach furnishes vinyl functionalized ACEs in high yields and enantioselectivity. Using this approach, a wide range of chiral crown ethers with ring sizes ranging from 12 to 36 have been successfully prepared in high yields of up to 92%, dr of up to &gt;20:1 and er of up to &gt;99:1.These vinyl substituted CEs allow for further diversification giving facile access to various CE derivatives as well as to their three&#8208;dimensional analogues using ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Some of these chiral CEs themselves display high potential for use in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Li+ Cations Activate NiFeOOH for Oxygen Evolution in Sodium and Potassium Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of green hydrogen production is reduced due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition to the optimal catalyst properties, electrocatalytic activity also depends on the interaction of the electrocatalyst with the electrolyte. Here, we show that the addition of small amounts of Li+ to Fe&#8208;free NaOH or KOH electrolytes activates NiFeOOH for the OER compared to single&#8208;cation electrolytes. Moreover, the activation was maintained when the solution was returned to pure NaOH. Importantly, we show that the origin of activation by Li+ cations is primarily non&#8208;kinetic in nature, as the OER onset for the mixed electrolyte does not change and the Tafel slope at low current density is ~30 mV/dec in both electrolytes. However, the increase of the apparent Tafel slope remains lower at increasing current densities in the presence of Li+. Based on electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and in situ X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy measurements, we show that this reduction of non&#8208;kinetic effects is due to enhanced intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide in the Li+ activated catalyst. This enhanced electrolyte penetration facilitates the OER, especially at higher current densities and for increased catalyst loading, which is important for industrial electrolyzer systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Surface Terminations for Charge Storage of Ti3C2T x  MXene Electrodes in Aqueous Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we used 2&#8208;Dimmensionnal Ti3C2 MXene as model materials to understand how the surface groups affect their electrochemical performance. By adjusting the nature of the surface terminations (Cl&#8208;, N/O&#8208;, and O&#8208;) of Ti3C2 MXene through a molten salt approach, we could change the spacing between MXene layers and the level of water confinement, resulting in significant modifications of the electrochemical performance in acidic electrolyte. Using a combination of techniques including in&#8208;operando X&#8208;ray diffraction and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we found that the presence of confined water results in a drastic transition from an almost electrochemically inactive behavior for Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to an ideally fast pseudocapacitive signature for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene. This experimental work not only demonstrates the strong connection between surface terminations and confined water but also reveals the importance of confined water on the charge storage mechanism and the reaction kinetics in MXene.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Arynes are fleeting, high&#8208;energy intermediates that undergo myriad trapping reactions by nucleophiles. Their unusual reactivity compared to other electrophiles can spur unexpected mechanistic pathways enroute to the formation of benzenoid products. Herein we explore a particularly unique case of thermally generated arynes reacting with phosphoranes to form helical dibenzothiophenes and &#8208;selenophenes. Multiple new helical polycyclic aromatic products are reported. DP4+ and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis were used in tandem to confirm the structural topologies of selected products and to demonstrate the utility of DP4+ for distinguishing between isomeric polycyclic aromatic compounds. Lastly, we discuss a plausible mechanism consistent with DFT computations that accounts for the product formation; namely, ligand coupling (i.e., reductive elimination) within a hypervalent, pentacarbon&#8208;ligated&#160;s&#8208;phosphorane furnishes the dibenzothio&#8208; or dibenzoselenophene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking the Impact of Koch&#8208;Carbonylated Organics During the Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyzed Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>

         <dc:description>
The complementary research strategy (involving catalysis, operando UV/Vis, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) bridges the mechanistic gap between Koch&#8208;type carbonylation&#8208;led direct and dual cycle mechanisms during the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process.







Abstract
A methanol&#8208;based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, the practical application of this process in a CO2&#8208;neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch&#8208;carbonylation&#8208;led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady&#8208;state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV/Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic&#8208;based investigations on the MTH process, involving co&#8208;feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch&#8208;carbonylated species), including selective isotope&#8208;labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch&#8722;)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side&#8208;chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene&#8208;toluene&#8208;xylene) primarily.

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular assembly can be designed by fusing binding domains. A precise optimization of the level of compaction of the assembly using linker of different lengths or compositions can provide a simple strategy to program their assembly properties (e.g., midpoint, dynamic range, and inhibition). The thermodynamic and mechanistic principles demonstrated herein also shine light behind the evolution of biological molecular assembly.







Abstract
Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50&#8197;years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion through Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological phase transition, mediated by oxygen vacancies, is discovered in free&#8208;standing Ni&#8208;Co oxides supported on graphene aerogel. This phase transition introduces NiCoO2/NiCo2O4 heterojunction in the surface region, thus improving the catalytic activity thanks to a strong internal electric field and gradient oxygen vacancies. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 and desorption of *CO intermediates, resulting in an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Weak adsorption of gas reactants and strong binding of intermediates present a significant challenge for most transition metal oxides, particularly in the realm of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we demonstrate that the adsorption can be fine&#8208;tuned by phase engineering of oxide catalysts. An oxygen vacancy mediated topological phase transition in Ni&#8208;Co oxide nanowires, supported on a hierarchical graphene aerogel (GA), is observed from a spinel phase to a rock&#8208;salt phase. Such in situ phase transition empowers the Ni&#8208;Co oxide catalyst with a strong internal electric field and the attainment of abundant oxygen vacancies. Among a series of catalysts, the in situ transformed spinel/rock&#8208;salt heterojunction supported on GA stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, yielding an impressive CO production rate of 12.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 96.5&#8201;%. This remarkable performance is a result of the robust interfacial coupling between two topological phases that optimizes the electronic structures through directional charge transfer across interfaces. The phase transition process induces more Co2+ in octahedral site, which can effectively enhance the Co&#8208;O covalency. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 molecules and desorption of reaction intermediates, thereby lowering the energetic barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Chemically Transformed Ag2Te Nanowires on Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane For Flexible Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible thermoelectric generator is prepared from chemically transformed Ag2Te nanowires, which are prepared from tellurium nanowires, for low power wearable and flexible electronic devices.







Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices of nanomaterials have shown a great potential for applications in wearable to remotely located electronics with desired shapes and geometries. Continuous powering up the low power flexible electronics is a major challenge. We are reporting a flexible thermoelectric module prepared from silver telluride (Ag2Te) nanowires (NWs), which are chemically transformed from uniquely synthesized and scalable tellurium (Te) NWs. Conducting Ag2Te NWs composites have shown an ultralow total thermal conductivity ~0.22&#8197;W/mK surpassing the bulk melt&#8208;grown Ag2Te ~1.23&#8197;W/mK at ~300&#8197;K, which is attributed to the nanostructuring of the material. Flexible thermoelectric device consisting of 4 legs (n&#8208;type) of Ag2Te NWs on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane displays a significant output voltage (Voc) ~2.3&#8197;mV upon human touch and Voc ~18&#8197;mV at temperature gradient, &#916;T ~50&#8197;K, which shows the importance of NWs based flexible thermoelectric devices to power up the low power wearable electronics.

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core&#8208;Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;expanded [10]annulene analog was synthesized and oxidized to its cationic states. These compounds exhibit notable structural flexibility, allowing for topological twisting. The dication displays a simultaneous presence of singly twisted and planar isomers within the crystal structure, distinguished by M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively. The tetracation shows H&#252;ckel aromaticity and open shell diradical nature.







Abstract
The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity.

     alt="Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core-Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core-expanded [10]annulene analog was synthesized and oxidized to its cationic states. These compounds exhibit notable structural flexibility, allowing for topological twisting. The dication displays a simultaneous presence of singly twisted and planar isomers within the crystal structure, distinguished by M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively. The tetracation shows H&#252;ckel aromaticity and open shell diradical nature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo-&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylmethine derivative (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and its tetracation (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Modifying the Oxidative Potentials of Imines in a Dye Loaded Capsule for Photocatalytic Cyclization with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the confinement effect of the host&#8208;dye photocatalytic system to shift the redox potentials of substrate, the isomerization and thermodynamic activation of substrate were achieved, which were followed by a multiphoton excitation enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Modifying redox potential of substrates and intermediates to balance pairs of redox steps are important stages for multistep photosynthesis but faced marked challenges. Through co&#8208;clathration of iridium photosensitizer and imine substrate within one packet of a metal&#8208;organic capsule to shift the redox potentials of substrate, herein, we reported a multiphoton enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings. The cage facilitated a pre&#8208;equilibrium substrate&#8208;involving clathrate that cathodic shifts the oxidation potential of the substrate&#8208;dye&#8208;host ternary complex and configuration inversion of substrate via spatial constraints in the confined space. The new two photon excitation strategy enabled the precise control of the multistep electron transfer between each pair (photosensitizer, substrate and the capsule), endowing the catalytic system proceeding smoothly with an enzymatic fashion. Three kinds of 2&#8208;subsituted (&#8722;OH, &#8722;NH2, and &#8722;SH) imines and N&#8208;aryl enamines all give the corresponding cyclization products efficiently under visible light irradiation, demonstrating the promising of the microenvironment driven thermodynamic activation in the host&#8208;dye&#8208;substrate ternary for synergistic combination of multistep photocatalytic transformations.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Pyrazine: A Structurally Simple and Easily Accessible Electron&#8208;Deficient Building Block for n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two simple structure and highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks (CNPz and DCNPz) were synthesized and incorporated into polymer backbone. P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show unipolar electron mobilities of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in OTFTs, respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, these two polymers exhibit electrical conductivities and power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is essential to accelerate the application of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). To achieve this objective, it is critical to design strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthesis, which are essential for the development of n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Herein, we synthesized two cyano&#8208;functionalized highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 3,6&#8208;dibromopyrazine&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitrile (CNPz) and 3,6&#8208;Dibromopyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile (DCNPz), which feature simple structures and facile synthesis. CNPz and DCNPz can be obtained via only one&#8208;step reaction and three&#8208;step reactions from cheap raw materials, respectively. Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) polymers, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is obtained for P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz), respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show high n&#8208;type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, respectively. Hence, the cyano&#8208;functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low&#8208;cost and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient building block for constructing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Asymmetric Anion Zinc Salt Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel zinc salt (Zn(DFTFSI)2) with an asymmetric structure anion group DFTFSI&#8722;, to enable a high ionic conductivity and engender in situ formation of a robust layer&#8208;structured SEI layer via easy decomposition of the asymmetric DFTFSI&#8722;. This robust SEI layer can quickly transfer Zn2+ ions, restrain dendrite growth, and suppress over 90&#8201;% hydrogen production, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.







Abstract
Organic additives with high&#8208;reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low&#8208;concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&#8208;)&#8208;based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&#8722; in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer&#8208;structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn
Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &gt;2500&#8197;h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a novel zinc salt (Zn(DFTFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with an asymmetric structure anion group DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, to enable a high ionic conductivity and engender in situ formation of a robust layer-structured SEI layer via easy decomposition of the asymmetric DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This robust SEI layer can quickly transfer Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, restrain dendrite growth, and suppress over 90&#8201;% hydrogen production, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic additives with high-reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low-concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)-based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite-free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer-structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn
Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &amp;gt;2500&#8197;h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn
Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200&#8197;cycles at ~99.8&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high-areal-capacity Zn
Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery (~5.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;), cycling over 320&#8197;cycles with 95.3&#8201;% initial capacity retained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Chemiluminophore for High&#8208;Contrast Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mMB, as a novel self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecule enabling photon sensitization, chemical defect formation, and afterglow generation, possessed a NIR afterglow chemiluminescence with a higher brightness and a NIR fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic signal. By introducing a responsive unit on the phenothiazine ring, it was tailored for ultrasensitive imaging of biomarkers with a superior activation ratio, enabling in vivo versatile imaging with high SBRs.







Abstract
Afterglow imaging holds great promise for ultrasensitive bioimaging due to its elimination of autofluorescence. Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs), which enable all&#8208;in&#8208;one photon sensitization, chemical defect formation and afterglow generation, possess a simplified, reproducible, and efficient superiority over commonly used multi&#8208;component systems. However, there is a lack of SAMs, particularly those with much brighter near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and structural flexibility for building high&#8208;contrast activatable imaging probes. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports a methylene blue derivative&#8208;based self&#8208;sustaining afterglow agent (SAN&#8208;M) with brighter NIR afterglow chemiluminescence peaking at 710&#8197;nm. By leveraging the structural flexibility and tunability, an activatable nanoprobe (SAN&#8208;MO) is customized for simultaneously activatable fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic and afterglow imaging of peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;), notably with a superior activation ratio of 4523 in the afterglow mode, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than other reported activatable afterglow systems. By virtue of the elimination of autofluorescence and ultrahigh activation contrast, SAN&#8208;MO enables early monitoring of the LPS&#8208;induced acute inflammatory response within 30&#8197;min upon LPS stimulation and precise image&#8208;guided resection of tiny metastatic tumors, which is unattainable for fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Identification of Direct Anchoring Sites for Monoatomic Dispersion of Precious Metals (Pt, Pd, Ag) on CeO2 Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface of the reducible support (CeO2), rather than the defects on the surface, are the direct anchoring sites of active metals. Therefore, active metals (Ag, Pt and Pd, etc.) can be single&#8208;atom dispersed on the terminal hydroxyl&#8208;rich CeO2&#8722;NC support (CeO2 (100) surfaces).







Abstract
Monoatomic dispersion of precious metals on the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals is a highly practical approach for dramatically reducing the usage of precious metals while exploiting the unique properties of single&#8208;atom catalysts. However, the specific atomic sites for anchoring precious metal atoms on the CeO2 support and underlying chemical mechanism remain partially unknown. Herein, we show that the terminal hydroxyls on the (100) surface are the most stable sites for anchoring Ag atoms on CeO2, indicating that CeO2 nanocubes are the most efficient substrates to achieve monoatomic dispersion of Ag. Importantly, the newly identified chemical mechanism for single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom dispersion on CeO2 nanocubes appears to be generic and can thus be extended to other precious metals (Pt and Pd). In fact, our experiments also show that atomically dispersed Pt/Pd species exhibit morphology&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent CO selectivity in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nonbenzenoid Heteroacene Crystals Synthesized via In&#8208;Situ Embedding of Ladder Bipyrazinylenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals are synthesized via the in&#8208;situ embedding of ladder bipyrazinylenes (LBPys) on Au(111). Through the intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and give rise to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Precisely introducing topological defects is an important strategy in nanographene crystal engineering because defects can tune &#960;&#8208;electronic structures and control molecular assemblies. The synergistic control of the synthesis and assembly of nanographenes by embedding the topological defects to afford two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals on surfaces is still a great challenge. By in&#8208;situ embedding ladder bipyrazinylene (LBPy) into acene, the narrowest nanographene with zigzag edges, we have achieved the precise preparation of 2D nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals on Au(111). Through intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and lead to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds. Using bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we determined the atomic structures of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene product and diverse organometallic intermediates. The tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed the electronic structure of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed distinct organometallic intermediates during progression annealing combined with DFT calculations demonstrated that LBPy formation proceeds via electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides, trapping of heteroarynes by Au adatoms, and stepwise elimination of Au adatoms.

         <title>Enabling Highly Robust Full&#8208;Color Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Stable White Organic Afterglow from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials have been developed by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into a melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer by solution polymerization. Their afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively. Moreover, the resulting polymer films showed a color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow and outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances.







Abstract
In this work, full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively, under ambient conditions. For the coronene&#8208;doped sample, its afterglow color could be linearly tuned between yellow and blue by adjusting the temperature, and it could still emit an intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68&#8197;s at 440&#8197;K. Moreover, the films showed a bright and stable white afterglow at 370&#8197;K with a lifetime of 2.80&#8197;s and maintained an excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150&#8197;days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting was also demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Formation of Pd&#8208;DNA Hybrids Using Tailored Palladium&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Towards Heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA Systems</title>

The selective creation of Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structures using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208; hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) highlights its enhanced affinity for cytosine compared to the previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] (Cheld=chelidamic acid). The resulting assembly mimics a natural DNA double helix, with the [Pd(Aqa)(Cytosine)] units acting as metal&#8208;mediated base pairs and offers the potential for heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids.@CanalUGR/@Galindo_Lab







Abstract
The formation of highly organized metal&#8208;DNA structures has significant implications in bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology and material science due to their unique properties and potential applications. In this study, we report on the conversion of single&#8208;stranded polydeoxycytidine (dC15) into a Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structure using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) through a self&#8208;assembly process. The resulting Pd&#8208;DNA assembly closely resembles a natural double helix, with continuous [Pd(Aqa)(C)] (C=cytosine) units serving as palladium&#8208;mediated base pairs, forming interbase hydrogen bonds and intrastrand stacking interactions. Notably, the design of the [Pd(Aqa)] complex favours the interaction with cytosine, distinguishing it from our previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] complex (Cheld=chelidamic acid). This finding opens possibilities for creating heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids where different complexes specifically bind to nucleobases. We confirmed the Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structural assembly and selective binding of the complexes using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Meltable Aluminum Molecular Rings with Fluorescence and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of meltable aluminum molecular rings with precise lattice doping of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) shows that the abundant, complex and strong hydrogen bonds between the clusters and the DESs components is responsible for the melting behavior. The hot&#8208;press method is used to prepare transparent bubble&#8208;free cluster&#8208;based glass films under autogenous pressure and study their fluorescence and nonlinear optical properties.







Abstract
Crystal&#8211;liquid&#8211;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk&#8208;shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble&#8208;free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot&#8208;press method. These cluster&#8208;based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics. It not only breaks the limitations of crystalline glass on metal and ligand types but also acts as a general guide for extending the range of meltable crystalline materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;lifespan Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitors Enabled by Anodes Integrated with Interconnected Mesoporous Chitosan Membranes through Electrophoresis&#8208;driven Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes are fabricated through electrophoresis. Reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation, endowing zinc ion capacitors with ultra&#8208;high stability.







Abstract
The advancement of highly secure and inexpensive aqueous zinc ion energy storage devices is impeded by issues, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and corrosion of zinc anodes. It is essential to modify the interface of zinc anodes that homogenizes ion flux and facilitates highly reversible zinc planarized deposition and stripping. Herein, by coupling zinc ion coordination with acid&#8208;base neutralization under the driving of electrophoresis, manageable mesoscopic phase separation for constructing chitosan frameworks was achieved, thereby fabricating interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes. The framework is constructed by twisted chitosan nanofiber bundles, forming a three&#8208;dimensional continuous spindle&#8208;shaped pore structure. With this framework, the electrolyte provides exceptional ion conductivity of 25.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with a puncture resistance strength of 2.3&#8197;GPa. In addition, the amino groups of chitosan molecule can make the surface of the framework positively charged. Thus, reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation. As a result, as&#8208;assembled zinc ion capacitor has an excellent cycle life and sustains the capacity by over 95&#8201;% after 20000&#8197;cycles at a current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This research presents a constructive strategy for stable electrolytes&#8208;integrated zinc anodes.
