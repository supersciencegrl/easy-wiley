      <title>Tailoring Component Interaction for Air&#8208;Processed Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaic</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskites with potential stability improvement is promising candidate for optoelectronic applications. However, fundamental questions remain over the component interaction in the perovskite precursor solution due to the limitation of the most commonly used solvents of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Here, we report a simple and very effective interaction tailoring strategy for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskites by involving ionic liquid solvent methylammonium acetate (MAAc). We found that C=O has strong interaction with lead (Pb2+) and the N&#8208;H&#8230;I hydrogen bonds formation are observed. The interaction enables the stable perovskite precursor solution and allows the high&#8208;quality production of pinhole&#8208;free, large grain size, and flat all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films by retarding the crystallization. With a one&#8208;step, without the necessity for antisolvent treatment, air&#8208;processing approach regardless of humidity, the corresponding photovoltaic cell exhibits a high efficiency of 17.10% along with long operation stability over 1500 h under continuous light illumination.</dc:description>

      <title>Predicting Regioselectivity in Radical C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycles through Machine Learning</title>
      <dc:description>Radical C&#8722;H bond functionalization provides a versatile approach for elaborating heterocyclic compounds. The synthetic design of this transformation relies heavily on the knowledge of regioselectivity, while a quantified and efficient regioselectivity prediction approach is still elusive. Herein we report the feasibility of using machine learning model to predict the transition state barrier from the computed properties of isolated reactants. This enables rapid and reliable regioselectivity prediction for the radical C&#8722;H bond functionalization of heterocycles. The Random Forest model with physical organic features achieved a 94.2% site accuracy and an 89.9% selectivity accuracy in the out&#8208;of&#8208;sample test set. The prediction performance was further validated by comparing the machine learning results with additional substituents, heteroarene scaffolds and experimental observations.

      <title>Structure and Unprecedented Reactivity of&#160;a Mononuclear&#160;Nonheme Cobalt(III)&#8208;Iodosylbenzene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>A mononuclear nonheme cobalt(III)&#8208;iodosylbenzene complex, [Co(III)(TQA)(OH)(OIPh)]2+&#160;(1), is synthesized and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. While 1 is a sluggish oxidant in oxidation reactions, it becomes a competent oxidant in oxygen atom transfer reactions, such as olefin epoxidation, in the presence of a small amount of proton. More interestingly, 1 shows a nucleophilic reactivity in aldehyde deformylation reaction, demonstrating that 1 possesses an amphoteric reactivity. Another interesting observation is that 1 can be used as an oxygen atom donor in the generation of high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo complexes. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports the first crystal structure of a Co(III)&#8208;iodosylbenzene complex and the unprecedented reactivities of metal&#8208;iodosylarene complexes, such as the nucleophilic reactivity in the deformylation of aldehydes and the use of a metal&#8208;iodosylbenzene complex as an oxygen atom donor in the synthesis of a metal&#8208;oxo complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing Selectivity and Creating Structural Diversity Through Hybrid Polyketide Synthases</title>
      <dc:description>Engineering polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways that efficiently produce new metabolites requires an understanding of substrate selectivity, flexibility, and sites of failure during chain elongation, processing and termination. Growing evidence indicates that the thioesterase (TE) domain is a significant bottleneck within engineered modular PKS systems. Accordingly, we created a series of hybrid PKS modules bearing exchanged TE domains from heterologous pathways, and challenged them in vitro with both native and non&#8208;native full&#8208;length synthetic polyketide substrates. Reactions pairing wildtype PKS modules with non&#8208;native substrates predominantly resulted in poor conversions to anticipated macrolactones. Likewise, product formation with native substrates and hybrid PKS modules bearing non&#8208;cognate TE domains was severely reduced or undetectable. In contrast, non&#8208;native substrates were accepted, processed and cyclized by most hybrid modules if the engineered PKS contained a substrate compatible TE, directly implicating this domain as the major catalytic gatekeeper. Additionally, the TE domains preferentially cyclized polyketides that bore the expected oxidation state at the C&#8208;3 position, effectively bypassing non&#8208;cognate module directed reduction and altering the predicted catalytic sequence. Extending these findings led to formation of a novel metabolite containing a pyran ring instead of the predicted macrolactone. Collectively, these data provide new insights regarding the PKS TE as an important target for protein engineering to optimize polyketide analog assembly in engineered PKS pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Electric&#8208;field assisted in&#8208;situ hydrolysis of metal&#8208;organic framework bulk into ultrathin metal oxyhydroxide nanosheets for efficient oxygen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Facile preparation of low cost electro&#8208;catalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a big challenge. Herein, a novel strategy for ultrafast (20 s) transformation of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) bulk into ultrathin metal oxyhydroxide nanosheets for efficient OER has been developed. For two isomeric MOFs (  FJI&#8208;H25Fe  and  FJI&#8208;H25FeCo  ), only the metastable  FJI&#8208;H25FeCo  bulk can immediately transform into FeCo oxyhydroxides nanosheets through electric&#8208;field assisted hydrolysis. The potential evolution process from MOF bulk to FeCo oxyhydroxides nanosheets has been investigated in detail. The as&#8208;made nanosheets exhibit excellent OER performances, showing an extremely low overpotential of 231 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , a relatively small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec  &#8208;1  , and at least long&#8208;term durability of 30 h. This work not only provides a novel strategy for facile preparation of low&#8208;cost and efficient OER electro&#8208;catalysts, but also represents a new way for preparation of metal oxyhydroxides nanosheets with good crystallinity and morphology and a fresh method for mild synthesis of nano&#8208;sized derivatives from MOF materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
One for all: A high&#8208;affinity amyloid&#8208;suppressing interaction between the human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory polypeptide cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 and the key type 2 diabetes (T2D) amyloid polypeptide IAPP was identified.

Abstract
Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is linked to pancreatic inflammation, &#946;&#8208;cell degeneration, and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The multifunctional host&#8208;defence peptides (HDPs) cathelicidins play crucial roles in inflammation. Here, we show that the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory polypeptide human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 binds IAPP with nanomolar affinity and effectively suppresses its amyloid self&#8208;assembly and related pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell damage in&#8197;vitro. In addition, we identify key LL&#8208;37 segments that mediate its interaction with IAPP. Our results suggest a possible protective role for LL&#8208;37 in T2D pathogenesis and offer a molecular basis for the design of LL&#8208;37&#8208;derived peptides that combine antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and T2D&#8208;related anti&#8208;amyloid functions as promising candidates for multifunctional drugs.

      <title>Catalytic Disproportionation of Formic Acid to Methanol using Recyclable Silylformates</title>
      <dc:description>A novel strategy to prepare methanol from formic acid without external reductant is presented. The overall process described herein consists in the disproportionation of silyl formates to methoxysilanes catalyzed by ruthenium complexes and the production of methanol thereof by simple hydrolysis. Aqueous solutions of MeOH (&gt; 1&#160;mL, &gt; 70&#160;% yield) were prepared in this manner. The sustainability of the reaction has been established by the recycling of the silicon&#8208;containing byproducts with cheap and readily available reagents.
These results show how shutting down the dehydrogenation of formic acid can provide a high yielding disproportionation route to methanol. While hydrosilylation chemistry is hampered by the generation of siloxane wastes, they also demonstrate for the first time that reductive chemistry with silicon&#8208;based reductants can be amenable to renewability.</dc:description>

      <title>Active Intermediates in Copper Nitrite Reductase Reactions Probed by a Cryotrapping&#8208;Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Approach.</title>
      <dc:description>Redox active metalloenzymes catalyse a range of biochemical processes essential for life. However, due to their complex reaction mechanisms, and often, their poor optical signals, detailed mechanistic understandings of them are limited. Here, we develop a cryoreduction approach coupled to electron paramagnetic resonance measurements to study electron transfer between the copper centers in the copper nitrite reductase (CuNiR) family of enzymes. Unlike alternative methods used to study electron transfer reactions, the cryoreduction approach presented here allows observation of the redox state of both metal centers, a direct read&#8208;out of electron transfer, determines the presence of the substrate/product in the active site and shows the importance of protein motion in inter&#8208;copper electron transfer catalyzed by CuNiRs. Cryoreduction&#8208;EPR is broadly applicable for the study of electron transfer in other redox enzymes and paves the way to explore transient states in multiple redox&#8208;centre containing proteins (homo and hetero metal ions).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Current bacterial RNA switches suffer from lack of versatile inputs and are difficult to engineer. Here we present versatile and modular RNA switches that are  trans  &#8208;encoded and based on tRNA mimicking structures (TMSs). These switches provide a high degree of freedom for reengineering and can thus be designed to accept a wide range of inputs including RNA, small molecules and proteins. This powerful approach allows controlling translation of protein expression from plasmid and genome DNA.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Current bacterial RNA switches suffer from lack of versatile inputs and are difficult to engineer. Here we present versatile and modular RNA switches that are  trans  &#8208;encoded and based on tRNA mimicking structures (TMSs). These switches provide a high degree of freedom for reengineering and can thus be designed to accept a wide range of inputs including RNA, small molecules and proteins. This powerful approach allows controlling translation of protein expression from plasmid and genome DNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reversible Ligand&#8208;Gated Ion Channel via the Interconversion between Hollow Single Helix and Intertwined Double Helix</title>
      <dc:description>Ligand responsiveness is one of the typical mechanisms in biological organizations to trigger the sophisticated channel switch. Here, we reported a new type of helical trimer which could undergo the transition between hollow single helix and intertwined double helix with no cavity via the complexation and decomplexation with Cu ions.

      <title>Reply to the Comment on &#8220;Realization of Lewis Basic Sodium Anion in the NaBH3&#8722; Cluster&#8221;</title>
      <dc:description>
In this reply to the preceding comment, the Na&#8722;B interaction in the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is still considered as a dative bond: it fulfills all existing definitions about the dative bond. This conclusion is additionally supported by the energetic pathways and NBO charges calculated at UCCSD and CASMP2(4,4) levels of theory.







Abstract
We reply to the comment by S. Pan and G. Frenking who challenged our interpretation of the Na&#8722;:&#8594;BH3 dative bond in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster. Our conclusion remains the same as that in our original paper (https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201907089 and https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.201907089). This conclusion is additionally supported by the energetic pathways and NBO charges calculated at UCCSD and CASMP2(4,4) levels of theory. We also discussed the suitability of the Laplacian of electron density (QTAIM) and Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning (AdNDP) method for bond type assignment. It seems that AdNDP yields more sensible results. This discussion reveals that the complex realm of bonding is full of semantic inconsistencies, and we invite experimentalists and theoreticians to elaborate this topic and find solutions incorporating different views on the dative bond.

      <title>Water Catalysis of the Reaction of Methanol with OH Radical in the Atmosphere is Negligible</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;level prediction of the rate of the atmospheric reaction CH3OH + OH catalyzed by a water molecule at 200&#8211;400&#8197;K is reported. We find no significant catalytic effect of water vapor on the CH3OH and OH reaction.







Abstract
Faced with the contradictory results of two recent experimental studies [Jara&#8208;Toro et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, 56, 2166 and Chao et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 5013] of the possible catalytic effect of water vapor on CH3OH + OH reaction, we report calculations that corroborate the conclusion made by Chao et&#8197;al. and extend the rate constant evaluation down to 200&#8197;K. The rate constants of the CH3OH + OH reaction catalyzed by a water molecule are computed as functions of temperature and relative humidity using high&#8208;level electronic structure and kinetics calculations. The Wuhan&#8211;Minnesota Scaling (WMS) method is used to provide accurate energetics to benchmark a density functional for direct dynamics. Both high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;frequency anharmonicities are included. Variational and tunneling effects are treated by canonical variational transition state theory with multidimensional small&#8208;curvature tunneling. And, most significantly, we include multistructural effects in the rate constant calculations. Our calculations show that the catalytic effect of water vapor is not observable at 200&#8211;400&#8197;K.

      <title>Hybrid Palladium Catalyst Assembled from Chiral Phosphoric Acid and Thioamide for Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8210;H Arylation</title>
      <dc:description>A hybrid plladium catalyst assembled from chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) and thioamide shows a high capacity for enabling a highly efficient and enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8210;H functionalization of thioamides (up to 99% yield, 97% e.e.). The regioselectivity is switched from the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen to the acyl side of the thioamide by introducing bulky N&#8208;substituents. A kinetic resolution of unsymmetrical thioamides via intermolecular C(sp  3  )&#8210;H arylation can be achieved in high&#8208;levels of s&#8208;factor. ESI&#8208;MS studies indicate that the chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) is able to facilitate the C&#8210;H activation to generate the palladation intermediates. Two thioamides coordinate to the palladium in the C&#8210;H activation step, one undergoing &#946;&#8208;C&#8210;H activation and the other acting as a ligand. DFT calculations suggest that stereocontrol is achieved by embedding the substrate in a robust chiral cavity defined by the bulky CPA with a neutral thioamide.</dc:description>

      <title>On&#8208;surface synthesis of cumulene&#8208;like&#160;polymers via two&#8208;step dehalogenative homocoupling of dibromomethylenes</title>
      <dc:description>Cumulene compounds are notoriously difficult to prepare and study due to dramatically increasing reactivity with increasing number of consecutive double bonds. In this respect, the emerging field of on&#8208;surface synthesis provides exceptional opportunities because it relies on reactions on clean metal substrates under well&#8208;controlled ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Here we report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of a polymer linked by cumulene&#8208;like bonds on a Au(111) surface via sequential thermally activated dehalogenative C&#8208;C coupling of a tribenzo&#8208;azulene precursor equipped with two dibromomethylenes. The structure and electronic properties of the resulting polymer with cumulene&#8208;like pentagon&#8208;pentagon and heptagon&#8208;heptagon connections have been investigated by means of scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy methods and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by density functional theory calculations. Our results provide perspectives for the on&#8208;surface synthesis of compounds containing cumulene&#8208;like bonds, as well as protocols relevant to the stepwise fabrication of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds on surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Conversion of Light to Chemical Energy: Directional, Chiral Photoswitches with Very High Quantum Yields</title>
      <dc:description>Photochromic systems have been used to achieve a number of engineering functions such as light energy conversion, molecular motors, pumps, actuators, and sensors. Key to p  rac  tical applications is a high efficiency in conversion of light to chemical energy, a rigid structure for the  trans  mission of force to the environment and directed motion during isomerization. We present a novel type of photochromic system (diindane diazocines), that converts visible light with an efficiency of 18% to chemical energy. Quantum yields are exceptionally high with &gt;70% for the  cis&#8208;trans  isomerization and 90% for the back&#8208;reaction and thus higher than the biochemical system rhodopsin (64%). Two diastereomers (  meso  and  rac  emate) were obtained in only two steps in high yields. Both isomers are directional switches with high conversion rates (76&#8208;99%). No fatigue was observed after several thousands of switching cycles in both systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Anomalous light induced spin state switching for Fe$^\mathrm{II}$ spin&#8208;crossover molecules in direct contact with metal surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>The light&#8208;induced spin state switching is one of the most attractive properties of the spin&#8208;crossover materials. In bulk, low spin (LS) to high spin (HS) conversion via the light&#8208;induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) effect may be achieved with a visible light while the HS&#8208;to&#8208;LS one (reverse&#8208;LIESST) requires an excitation in the near infrared range. Here, we show that those phenomena are strongly modified at the interface with a metal. Indeed, we report an anomalous spin conversion from HS state to LS state under blue light illumination for Fe$^\mathrm{II}$ spin&#8208;crossover molecules that are in direct contact with metallic (111) single crystal surfaces (copper, silver and gold). Moreover, we observe a usual LS to HS switching with soft X&#8208;rays, allowing some reversible switching between HS and LS states by the subsequent use of blue light and X&#8208;rays. To interpret this anomalous spin state switching and the different yields measured on the three samples, we propose a new mechanism for the spin transition, based on the light absorption by the substrate, that would generate low energy valence photo&#8208;electrons promoting molecular vibrational excitations and subsequent spin state switching at the molecule&#8208;metal interface.</dc:description>

      <title>Experimental Determination of Magnetic Anisotropy in Exchange&#8208;Bias Dysprosium Metallocene Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
      <dc:description>Uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is an essential property that governs the performance of dysprosium metallocene single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Determining this property using experimental methods is necessary and important as it provides direct information vital to the understanding of the magneto&#8208;structural correlation and a valuable reference for theoretical analysis, but has been proved extremely challenging.

For the first time, the magnetic easy axes of dysprosium metallocene SMMs are experimentally determined, confirming that the orientation of them are perpendicular to the equatorial plane. While the orientation of magnetic easy axis for  1  deviates from the normal direction (10.3&#176;), due to the stronger equatorial interactions between Dy  III  and methyl groups. Moreover, its magnetic axes&#160;show&#160;a temperature&#8208;dependent shifting, which is caused by the competition between the exchange interactions and Zeeman interactions. The fluorescence, specific heat studies and  ab initi  o  calculations reveal the significant influences of the bridging ligands on their low&#8208;lying exchange&#8208;based levels and consequently low&#8208;temperature magnetic properties. This work proves the role of equatorial interactions on the magnetic anisotropy and provides insights to design high&#8208;performance dysprosium metallocene SMMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Pay attention to the biological nanoparticles when studying the protein corona on nanomedicines</title>
      <dc:description>The protein corona of nanoparticles has in recent years received considerable attention, and even been postulated to be the missing link in the translation of nanomedicines from benchtop to bedside. Here, we highlight the different types of biological nanoparticles present in blood that need to be considered in the protein corona research field. We map their size, density and plasma concentrations and use this information to stress potential challenges related to the isolation of nanomedicines, with particular focus on liposomes, when using the traditional isolation methods that separate according to size and density.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;Fluorochromanes via I(I)/I(III) Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The chromane nucleus is common to a plenum of bioactive small molecules where it is frequently oxidized at position 3. Motivated by the importance of this position in conferring efficacy, and the prominence of bioisosterism in drug discovery, an I(I)/I(III) catalysis strategy to access enantioenriched 3&#8208;fluorochromanes is disclosed (up to 7:93  e.r.  ).  In situ  generation of ArIF  2  enables the direct fluorocyclization of allyl phenyl ethers to generate novel scaffolds that manifest the stereoelectronic  gauche  effect. Mechanistic interrogation using deuterated probes confirms a stereospecific process consistent with a type II  inv  pathway.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Multiple Anchoring and Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides by Amorphous MoS3 Nanoboxes for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The practical implementation of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is obstructed by the poor conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics, notorious shuttle effect, large volume variation, and low areal loading of sulfur electrodes. Herein, to conquer these main bottlenecks of sulfur electrodes, we have meticulously designed amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon/MoS  3  (NC/MoS  3  ) nanoboxes with hollow&#8208;porous architectures as an advanced sulfur host. Benefiting from the enhanced conductivity by the N&#8208;doped carbon, reduced shuttle effect by the strong chemical interaction between unsaturated Mo and lithium polysulfides, improved redox reaction kinetics by the catalytic effect of MoS  3  , great tolerance of volume variation and high sulfur loading arising from flexible amorphous materials with hollow&#8208;porous structures, the amorphous NC/MoS  3  nanoboxes enabled sulfur electrodes to deliver a high areal capacity with superior rate capacity and decent cycling stability. Moreover, the proposed synthetic strategy can be generalized to fabricate other amorphous metal sulfides nanoboxes, which are expected to show promising applications in the field of energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Expansion for Constructing Porous Organic Polymers with High Surface Areas and Well&#8208;Defined Nanopores</title>
      <dc:description>Construction of porous organic polymers (POPs) with high surface areas, well&#8208;defined nanopores and excellent stability remains extremely challenging due to unmanageable reaction process. Until now, only a few reported POPs have Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas (  S  BET  ) exceeding 3000 m  2  g  &#8211;1  . Herein, we demonstrate a molecular expansion strategy to integrate high surface areas, large nanopore sizes and outstanding stability into POPs. A series of hyper&#8208;crosslinked conjugated polymers (  HCCPs  ) with exceptional porosity are successfully synthesized through this strategy. Specially,  HCCP&#8208;6  and  HCCP&#8208;11  exhibit the highest surface areas (  S  BET  &gt; 3000 m  2  g  &#8211;1  ) and excellent total pore volumes (up to 3.98 cm  3  g  &#8211; 1  ) among these  HCCPs  . They present decent total CH  4  storage capacities of 491 and 421 mg g  &#8211;1  at 80 bar and 298 K, respectively. Meanwhile, they are highly stable in hostile environments. The facile and general molecular expansion strategy would lead to an unprecedented revolution in improving synthetic routes of POPs for desired functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in Fe&#8211;Ni Layered Double Hydroxide Arrays Coupled to Carbon Nanofibers: The Role of Phosphorus Doping</title>
      <dc:description>The key to bringing the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation from conception to application lies in the development of high&#8208;efficiency, cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcites, are promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to multiple metal centers and large surface areas. However, their activities in the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation are unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a simple and effective way of phosphorus doping to regulate the charge distribution in LDHs, thus promoting the nitrogen adsorption and activation. The P&#8208;doped LDHs are further coupled to a self&#8208;supported, conductive matrix, i.e., a carbon nanofibrous membrane, which prevents their aggregation as well as ensures rapid charge transfer at the interface. By this strategy, decent ammonia yield (1.72&#215;10&#8211;10 mol s&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2) and Faradaic efficiency (23%) are delivered at &#8211;0.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1M Na2SO4, which offers a new opportunity of tapping the unknown potentials of the well&#8208;known hydrotalcites (LDHs) in the field of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

      <title>Formation of Hierarchical FeCoS2&#8208;CoS2 Double&#8208;Shelled Nanotubes with Enhanced Performance for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Hierarchical FeCoS  2  &#8208;CoS  2  double&#8208;shelled nanotubes have been rationally designed and constructed for efficient photocatalytic CO  2  reduction under visible light. The synthetic strategy, engaging the two&#8208;step cation&#8208;exchange reactions, precisely integrates two metal sulfides into a double&#8208;shelled tubular heterostructure with both of the shells assembled from ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets. Benefiting from the distinctive structure and composition, the FeCoS  2  &#8208;CoS  2  hybrid can reduce bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface diffusion length of photoexcited charge carriers to facilitate their separation. Furthermore, this hybrid structure can expose abundant active sites for enhancing CO  2  adsorption and surface&#8208;dependent redox reactions, and harvest incident solar irradiation more efficiently by light scattering in the complex interior. As a result, these hierarchical FeCoS  2  &#8208;CoS  2  double&#8208;shelled nanotubes exhibit superior activity and high stability for photosensitized deoxygenative CO  2  reduction, affording a high CO&#8208;generating rate of 28.1 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  (per 0.5 mg of catalyst).</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of All&#8208;carbon Disubstituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes by Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Kumada Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are important motifs in drug design as surrogates for p&#8208;substituted arenes and alkynes. Access to all&#8208;carbon disubstituted BCPs via cross coupling has to date been limited to use of the BCP as the organometallic component, which restricts scope due to the harsh conditions typically required for the synthesis of metallated BCPs. Here we report a general method to access 1,3&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted BCPs from 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (iodo&#8208;BCPs) by direct iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents. This chemistry represents the first general use of iodo&#8208;BCPs as electrophiles in cross&#8208;coupling, and the first Kumada coupling of tertiary iodides. Benefiting from short reaction times, mild conditions, and broad scope of the coupling partners, it enables the synthesis of a wide range of 1,3&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted BCPs including various drug analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Isopeptide&#8208;N&#8208;ethylated deubiquitylase&#8208;resistant ubiquitin probes made through an E1&#8208;catalyzed chemoenzymatic strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Triazole&#8208;based deubiquitylase (DUB)&#8208;resistant ubiquitin (Ub) probes have recently emerged as effective tools for the discovery of Ub&#8208;chain specific interactors in proteomic studies, but their structural diversity is limited. Herein, we report a new family of DUB&#8208;resistant Ub probes based on isopeptide&#8208;N&#8208;ethylated dimeric or polymeric Ub chains, which can be efficiently prepared through a one&#8208;pot, E1&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction of recombinant Ub percursors to give various homotypic and even branched Ub probes at multi&#8208;milligram scale. Proteomic studies using label&#8208;free quantitative mass spectrometry indicated that the isopeptide&#8208;N&#8208;ethylated Ub probes may complement the triazole&#8208;based probes in the study of Ub interactome. Our study highlights the utility of modern protein synthetic chemistry to develop structurally new families of tool molecules needed for proteomic studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of the zwitterionic intermediate in 1,1&#8208;carboboration of alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of a Lewis acidic borane with an alkyne is a key step in a diverse range of main group transformations. Alkyne 1,1&#8208;carboboration, the Wrackmeyer reaction, is an archetypal transformation of this kind. 1,1&#8208;Carboboration has been proposed to proceed through a zwitterionic intermediate. We report the isolation and spectroscopic, structural and computational characterization of the zwitterionic intermediates generated by reaction of B(C6F5)3 with alkynes. The stepwise reactivity of the zwitterion provides new mechanistic insight for 1,1&#8208;carboboration and wider B(C6F5)3 catalysis.

      <title>Discovery of a Dual Function Cytochrome P450 that Catalyzes Enyne Formation in Cyclohexanoid Terpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Enynes are an important functionality in organic chemistry. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety is commonly found in cyclohexanoid natural products produced by endophytic and plant pathogenic fungi. Asperpentyn (  1  ) is a 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;containing cyclohexanoid terpenoid isolated from  Aspergillus  and  Pestalotiopsis  . The genetic basis and biochemical mechanism of 1,3&#8208;enyne biosynthesis in  1, and other natural products containing this motif, has remained enigmatic despite their potential ecological roles. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster and characterize two crucial enzymes in the biosynthesis of  1. We discovered a P450 monooxygenase that has a dual function to first catalyze dehydrogenation of the prenyl chain to generate a  cis&#8208;diene intermediate and then shows acetylenase activity to yield an alkyne moiety, giving the 1,3&#8208;enyne. We also characterized a UbiA prenyltransferase, which is unusual in that it favors transferring a five&#8208;carbon prenyl chain, rather than a polyprenyl chain, to a  p  &#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid acceptor.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic Photoresponsive Ion Channel and Photodriven Ion Pump with Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
      <dc:description>Biological ion channels and ion pumps with sub&#8208;nanometer sizes modulate ion transport in response to external stimuli. Realizing such functions with sub&#8208;nanometer solid&#8208;state nanopores have been an important topic with wide practical applications.

We show that the molecular&#8208;size pores enable precise and robust optoelectronic ion transport modulation in a broad range of concentrations, unparalleled with conventional solid&#8208;state nanopores. Upon decoration with platinum nanoparticles to form a Schottky barrier photodiode, photovoltage across the membrane is generated with uphill ion transport from low concentration to high concentration. These results may spark applications in energy conversion, ion sieving, and artificial synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Gating of Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels with Confined Light&#8208;Responsive Azobenzene Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanochannels modified with responsive molecules have been fabricated to replicate gating functionalities of biological ion channels. But gating effects of the small&#8208;molecular&#8208;modified nanochannels are usually weak mainly because small molecular gates could not efficiently block the large channels at the close states. Herein we report three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) sub&#8208;nanochannels (SNCs) confined with azobenzene (AZO) molecules to achieve efficient light&#8208;gating functionalities. The 3D MOFSNCs consisting of ~9&#8208;12&#8208;&#197;&#8208;sized cavities connected by ~6&#8208;&#197;&#8208;sized triangular windows work as angstrom&#8208;scale ion channels, while confined AZO within the MOF cavities function as light&#8208;driven molecular gates to efficiently regulate the ion flux. The AZO&#8208;MOFSNCs show a good cyclic gating performance and high on&#8208;off ratios up to ~17.8, which is one order of magnitude higher than ratios of ~1.3&#8208;1.5 observed in conventional 1D AZO&#8208;modified nanochannels. This work provides a new and feasible strategy to develop highly&#8208;efficient switchable ion channels based on 3D porous MOFs and small responsive molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Acetalization via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution for Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Alkoxybutenolide by Thiourea&#8211;Quaternary Ammonium Salt Catalysts: Its Application to Strigolactones</title>

As explained by K. Murata, D. Suzuki, et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003493), styrene monomers recognize molecular&#8208;scale differences in polarity within the microgels during emulsion polymerization. This discovery enabled the synthesis of multilayer nanocomposite microgels in one step by free radical seed emulsion polymerization.

      <title>Total Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A scalable route to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amanitin: The bicyclic octapeptide is built up by solid&#8208;phase assembly of a linear octamer followed by two consecutive cyclization steps in solution. The key non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine, are accessible via multistep synthesis on a multigram scale. Amatoxins are important for the development of new payload linkers for antibody&#8211;drug conjugates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amanitin and related amatoxins have been studied for more than six decades mostly by isolation from death cap mushrooms. The total synthesis, however, remained challenging due to unique structural features. &#945;&#8208;Amanitin is a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Interrupting the basic transcription processes of eukaryotes leads to apoptosis of the cell. This unique mechanism makes the toxin an ideal payload for antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). Only microgram quantities of toxins, when delivered selectively to tumor sites through conjugation to antibodies, are sufficient to eliminate malignant tumor cells of almost every origin. By solving the stereoselective access to dihydroxyisoleucine, a photochemical synthesis of the tryptathion precursor, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, and macrolactamization we obtained a scalable synthetic route towards synthetic &#945;&#8208;amanitin. This makes &#945;&#8208;amanitin and derivatives now accessible for the development of new ADCs.

&lt;p&gt;&#945;&#8208;Amanitin and related amatoxins have been studied for more than six decades mostly by isolation from death cap mushrooms. The total synthesis, however, remained challenging due to unique structural features. &#945;&#8208;Amanitin is a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Interrupting the basic transcription processes of eukaryotes leads to apoptosis of the cell. This unique mechanism makes the toxin an ideal payload for antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). Only microgram quantities of toxins, when delivered selectively to tumor sites through conjugation to antibodies, are sufficient to eliminate malignant tumor cells of almost every origin. By solving the stereoselective access to dihydroxyisoleucine, a photochemical synthesis of the tryptathion precursor, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, and macrolactamization we obtained a scalable synthetic route towards synthetic &#945;&#8208;amanitin. This makes &#945;&#8208;amanitin and derivatives now accessible for the development of new ADCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organoboron&#8208;Functionalization Enables the Hierarchical Assembly of Giant Polyoxometalate Nanocapsules</title>
      <dc:description>
Giant nanocapsules with dimensions of up to 4&#8197;nm and a molecular weight of 57&#8197;kDa were obtained from Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates functionalized with aromatic boronic acids, as reported by Z. Zheng, C. Streb, X. Chen, et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003550). A &#8220;lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; organofunctionalization route was used for the regiospecific attachment of the boronic acids to pre&#8208;functionalized sites within the Dawson anions. This results in the aggregation of closed capsules rather than infinite networks.

      <title>Squalenyl Hydrogen Sulfate Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Delivery of Tobramycin and Alkylquinolone Quorum Sensing Inhibitor to Eradicate P. aeruginosa Biofilm Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Simultaneous delivery of tobramycin and alkylquinolone inhibitors by a self&#8208;assembling nanoparticle system based on squalenyl hydrogen sulfate (SqNPs) is an optimal therapeutic against&#160;P. aeruginosa&#160;biofilm infections. As described by C.&#8208;M. Lehr et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202001407), the drug&#8208;loaded SqNPs show improved biofilm penetration and enhanced efficacy in relevant biological barriers (mucin/human tracheal mucus, biofilm), leading to complete eradication of&#160;P. aeruginosa&#160;biofilms at 16&#8208;fold lower tobramycin concentration than tobramycin alone.

      <title>Structural Elucidation of Selective Solvatochromism in a Responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal Cyclometalated Platinum(II) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Platinum is king! A responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal platinum(II) emitter undergoes supramolecular and redox transformations on demand, as demonstrated by M.&#8197;J. MacLachlan et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002646). PtII selectively oxidizes into PtIII or PtIV, thus diversifying the structural and photophysical properties of the emitter. Delicate modulation of Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions by solvent molecules results in strong vapo/solvatochromic effects.

      <title>Powering artificial enzymatic cascades with electrical energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrical energy powers an artificial enzymatic cascade in a continuous flow reactor. As reported in their Communiation (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202001302), L. Lauterbach et&#8197;al. combined electrolysis in a scalable platform with a H2&#8208; and O2&#8208;dependent enzymatic cascade and separated both systems with a gas&#8208;permeable membrane. The synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles from diamines is demonstrated with up to 99&#8201;% product formation along with excellent regioselective labeling with stable isotopes.

Illuminating bacterial pathogens by a specific lanthanide luminescent turn&#8208;on probe is demonstrated by H.&#8208;Y. Hu, M. Nazar&#233; et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002391). A non&#8208;fluorescent caged precursor is intracellularly activated by bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) forming a sensitizing, light&#8208;harvesting antenna. Entrapment of the probe inside bacterial cells allows for precise localization of live bacteria by fluorescence lifetime imaging.

Time&#8208;resolved impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, which is an ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman technique, facilitates capturing vibrational snapshots of the excited state molecules with high sensitivity and time resolution. By using this technique, D. Kim et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Research Artible (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002733) that structural symmetry breaking is an important prerequisite for a charge separation reaction in a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor perylene bisimide.

      <title>Luminescence amplification at BiVO4 photoanodes by photoinduced electrochemiluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) combines semiconductor (SC) photoelectrochemistry with electrochemiluminescence (ECL). In PECL, the incident light is converted to a different wavelength by an electrochemical reaction at a SC photoelectrode and allows to trigger ECL at unprecedented low potentials. This concept has been employed so far to design up&#8208;conversion systems using Si or III&#8208;V SCs. Nevertheless, PECL strongly suffers from the photoelectrochemical instability of these low bandgap SCs. Here, we report for the first time an original light conversion strategy based on PECL of a luminol derivative (L&#8208;012) at BiVO  4  photoanodes in water. An incident light photo&#8208;excites simultaneously the L&#8208;012 fluorescence and the photoanode. However, the resulting fluorescence signal is surpassed by the PECL emission. In addition, we show that, with this system, PECL can be induced at a potential as low as &#8208;0.4 V for several hours and that it can be employed to finely tune L&#8208;012 luminescence. This remarkable light enhancement and the record low applied potential are promising for the design of new analytical strategies and light&#8208;addressable systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Cysteine/Penicillamine ligation independent of terminal steric demands for protein chemical synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The chemical ligation of two unprotected peptides to generate a natural peptidic linkage specifically at the  C  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;termini is a challenging but desirable platform for protein chemical synthesis, as it demands high reactivity and selectivities (chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity). Here, we report an operationally simple and highly effective chemical peptide ligation involving peptides with  C  &#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde esters to ligate peptides with  N  &#8208;terminal cyste&#8208;ine/penicillamine. The notable features of this method include its tolerance of steric hinderance from the side groups on either ligating terminus, allowing the flexible disconnection at sites that are otherwise difficult to functionalize. In addition, this method can be expanded to selective desulfurization and one&#8208;pot ligation&#8208;desulfurization reactions. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by synthesis of VISTA (216&#8208;311), PD&#8208;1 (192&#8208;288) and Eglin C.</dc:description>

      <title>A bioorthogonal click chemistry toolbox for targeted synthesis of branched and well&#8208;defined protein&#8208;protein conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry holds great potential to generate difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access protein&#8208;protein conjugate architectures. Current applications are hampered by challenging protein expression systems, slow conjugation chemistry, use of undesirable catalysts, or often do not result in quantitative product formation. Here we present a highly efficient technology for protein functionalization with commonly used bioorthogonal motifs for Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition with inverse electron demand (DA  inv  ). With the aim of precisely generating branched protein chimeras, we systematically assessed the reactivity, stability and side product formation of various bioorthogonal chemistries directly at the protein level. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our conjugation platform using different functional proteins and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab. This technology enables fast and routine access to tailored and hitherto inaccessible protein chimeras useful for a variety of scientific disciplines. We expect our work to substantially enhance antibody applications such as immunodetection and protein toxin&#8208;based targeted cancer therapies.</dc:description>

Temperature&#8208;induced structure reconstruction of support can firmly anchor single&#8208;atom Pt species to adapt high temperature environment.

Experiments reveal that high valence Pt 4+  with more covalent bonds on Mn 2  O 3  are essential for anchoring isolated Pt atoms by strong interaction. Optimized catalyst by moderate H 2  O 2  etching exhibits the best catalytic performance and the excellent thermal stability of single&#8208;atom Pt in high&#8208;temperature CH 4  oxidation on account of more exposed Pt atoms and strong Pt&#8208;Mn 2  O 3  interaction.</dc:description>

Nanocatalosomes are a new type of plasmonic bilayer&#8208;vesicular nanoreactors with few&#8208;nm intershell nanospace, as demonstrated by I.&#8197;S. Lee et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202001531). They possess numerous interlayer&#8208;confined catalytically active cavities harnessing synergistic plasmonic&#8211;catalytic effects and performing highly efficient solar light&#8208;induced organic reactions.

      <title>Chiral Reticular Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral AIEgen into Optically Pure MOFs with Dual Mechano&#8208;Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is attractive in understanding the excited&#8208;state chirality and developing advanced materials. Herein, we propose a chiral reticular self&#8208;assembly strategy to unite achiral AIEgen, chirality donor and metal ion to fabricate optically pure AIEgen MOFs as efficient CPL materials. We have found that CPL activity of the single&#8208;crystal AIEgen MOF was generated by the framework enabled strong emission from AIEgens and through&#8208;space chirality transfer from chirality donors to achiral AIEgens via metal&#8208;ion bridges. For the first time, a dual mechano&#8208;switched blue and red&#8208;shifted CPL activity was achieved via ultrasonication and grinding, respectively, which enabled the rotation or stacking change of AIEgen rotors with the survived homochiral framework.

      <title>Super&#8208; and Ferro&#8208;elastic Organic Semiconductors for Ultraflexible Single Crystal Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>Like silicon, single crystals of organic semiconductors are pursued to attain intrinsic charge transport properties. However, they are intolerant to mechanical deformation, impeding their applicability in flexible electronic devices. Such contradictory properties, namely exceptional molecular ordering and mechanical flexibility are unified in this work.

      <title>High&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by Ni single atom catalysts with tetradentate N2O2 coordination in a three&#8208;phase flow cell</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H 2  O 2  ) is widely used in today&#8217;s chemical industry as an oxidant and bleaching agent, whilst also finding medical utilization as a mild antiseptic. Over the past few years, researchers have targeted the discovery of low cost electrocatalysts which can selectively reduce dioxygen (O 2  ) to H 2  O 2  , with modest success to date. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of carbon&#8208;supported Ni(II) single atom catalysts possessing a tetradentate Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  coordination via a simple &#8220;Schiff base ligand&#8208;mediated&#8221; pyrolysis strategy. Briefly, a Ni(II) complex of the Schiff base ligand (R,R)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;N,N'&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (Jacobsen&#8217;s ligand) was adsorbed onto a carbon black support, followed by pyrolysis of the modified carbon material at 300 o  C in Ar. The obtained Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  /C catalyst showed excellent performance for the electrocatalytic reduction of O 2  to H 2  O 2  through a two&#8208;electron transfer process in alkaline conditions, with a H 2  O 2  selectivity of 96% realized in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode tests. At a current density of 70 mA cm &#8208;2  , a H 2  O 2  production rate of 5.9 mol g catalyst  &#8208;1  h &#8208;1  was achieved using a three &#8208;  phase flow cell, with good catalyst stability maintained over 8 h of testing. In addition, the Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  /C catalyst could electrocatalytically reduce O 2  in air to H 2  O 2  at a high current density, still affording a high H 2  O 2  selectivity (&gt; 90%). A precise Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  coordination was key to this impressive performance, guiding the future development of metal single atom catalysts for selective O 2  reduction to H 2  O 2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Photochromic Free MOF&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Optical Switch</title>
      <dc:description>We demonstrate herein an all&#8208;optical switch based on stimuli&#8208;responsive and photochromic&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic framework (HKUST&#8208;1). Ultrafast near&#8208;infrared laser pulses stimulate a reversible 0.4 eV blue shift of the absorption band with up to 200 s  &#8208;1  rate due to dehydration and concomitant shrinking of the structure&#8208;forming [Cu  2  C  4  O  8  ] cages of HKUST&#8208;1. Such light&#8208;induced switching enables the remote modulation of intensities of photoluminescence of single crystals of HKUST&#8208;1 as well visible radiation passing through the crystal by 2 order of magnitude. This opens up the possibility of utilyzing stimuli&#8208;responsive MOFs for all&#8208;optical data processing devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Transient DNA&#8208;based nanostructures controlled by redox inputs</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic DNA has emerged as a powerful self&#8208;assembled material for the engineering of nanoscale supramolecular devices and materials. Initial examples were focused on thermodynamically driven self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;based structures with exquisite near&#8208;angstrom control of their geometry. More recently dissipative self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;based supramolecular structures has emerged as a novel approach providing access to a new class of kinetically&#8208;controlled DNA materials with unprecedented life&#8208;like properties. In the examples reported so far, dissipative control has been achieved using DNA&#8208;recognizing enzymes as energy dissipating units. Although highly efficient, enzymes pose limits in terms of long term stability and inhibition of enzyme activity by waste products. Here we provide the first example of kinetically controlled DNA nanostructures in which energy dissipation is achieved through a non&#8208;enzymatic chemical reaction. More specifically, inspired by the redox signalling employed by cells to control cellular processes, we employ redox cycles of disulfide&#8208;bond formation/breakage to kinetically control the assembly and disassembly of DNA tubular nanostructures in a highly controllable and reversible fashion. To this purpose, we have rationally designed disulfide DNA strands acting as regulators for the assembly or disassembly of the DNA&#8208;based structures. Upon reduction these strands loose their regulatory function which causes the system to return to the basal non&#8208;assembled resting state. The exploitation of redox chemistry as a new control mechanism will facilitate the implementation of fuelled&#8208;DNA self&#8208;assembly processes in a synthetic context without the limitations linked to the use of enzymatic reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Prospect of Sulfurized Pyrolyzed Poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention S@pPAN: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.

      <title>Molecular Springs: Integration of Complex Dynamic Architectures into Functional Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Spring fever: Supramolecular springs are defined as helical molecules or assemblies thereof in which the pitch can be modulated by external stimuli to achieve full control over the extension&#8211;contraction motion. In this Minireview, the structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and spring&#8208;like materials triggered by external stimuli are highlighted for potential future applications in responsive macroscopic devices.







Abstract
Molecular/supramolecular springs are artificial nanoscale objects possessing well&#8208;defined structures and tunable physicochemical properties. Like a macroscopic spring, supramolecular springs are capable of switching their nanoscale conformation as a response to external stimuli by undergoing mechanical spring&#8208;like motions. This dynamic action offers intriguing opportunities for engineering molecular nanomachines by translating the stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoscopic motions into macroscopic work. These nanoscopic objects are reversible dynamic multifunctional architectures which can express a variety of novel properties and behave as adaptive nanoscopic systems. In this Minireview, we focus on the design and structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and their (self&#8208;)assembly as a prerequisite towards the generation of novel dynamic materials featuring controlled movements to be readily integrated into macroscopic devices for applications in sensing, robotics, and the internet of things.

      <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Nonheme Iron Oxidation Catalysis: Involvement of Oxoiron(V) Oxidants in Cleaving Strong C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of bio&#8208;inspired catalytic nonheme iron systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. This Review highlights recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the pathways that can be accessed by these systems to form high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.

Nonheme iron enzymes generate powerful and versatile oxidants that perform a wide range of oxidation reactions, including the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds, which is a major challenge for chemists. The oxidative abilities of these enzymes have inspired bioinorganic chemists to design synthetic models to mimic their ability to perform some of the most difficult oxidation reactions and study the mechanisms of such transformations. Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of these bio&#8208;inspired catalytic systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. In this Review, we highlight the recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the various pathways that can be accessed by bio&#8208;inspired nonheme iron systems to form the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.
