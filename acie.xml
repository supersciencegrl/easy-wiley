      <title>Development of High&#8208;Performance Pyrimidine Nucleoside and Oligonucleotide Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>Nucleosidic and oligonucleotidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes with high application potential. However, their further development is hampered by the poor understanding of how the chemical structure modulates the photochromic properties. Here we synthesized 26 systematically varied deoxyuridine&#8208; and deoxycytidine&#8208;derived DAEs and analyzed reaction quantum yields, composition of the photostationary states, thermal and photo&#173;chemical stability, and reversibility. This analysis identified two high&#8208;performance photoswitches with near&#8208;quantitative, fully reversible back&#8208;and&#8208;forth switching and no detectable thermal or photochemical deterioration. When incorporated into an oligonucleotide with the sequence of a promotor, the nucleotides maintained their photochromism and allowed the modulation of the transcription activity of T7 RNA polymerase with an up to 2.4&#8208;fold turn&#8208;off factor, demonstrating the potential for optochemical control of biological processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Interplay Between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a novel rotaxane/foldaxane hybrid architecture is reported. The winding of an aromatic oligoamide helix host around a dumbbell&#8208;shaped thread&#8208;like guest, or axle, already surrounded by a macrocycle was evidenced by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The process proved to depend on the position of the macrocycle along the axle and to the associated steric hindrance. The macrocycle thus behaves as a switchable shield that modulates the affinity of the helix for the axle. Reciprocally, the foldamer helix acts as a supramolecular auxiliary that compartmentalizes the axle. In some cases, the macrocycle is forced to move along the axle to allow the foldamer to reach its best recognition site.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction mechanism of CO  2  photoreduction into methane was elucidated by the time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under  13  CO  2  , H  2  , and UV&#8211;visible light,  13  CH  4  was formed at a rate of 0.98 mmol h  &#8722;1  g  cat  &#8722;1  using Ni (10 wt%)&#8211;ZrO  2  that was effective at 96 kPa. Under UV&#8211;visible light irradiation, the  13  CO  2  exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO  2  , followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni  0  sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni  0  , which was reversibly heated to 394 K owing to the heat converted from light. Using D  2  O and H  2  , H/D ratio in the formed methane was in agreement with H/D ratio in reactant. This study paves the way for using first row transition metals for solar fuel generation and on&#8208;site fuel supply on planets using only UV&#8211;visible light.</dc:description>

Fluorobenzene was cleanly defluorinated by photoactivated [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ], leading to biphenyl and [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}  2  ].

Irradiating benzene solutions of [{(  Ar  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ] (  Ar  Nacnac = [HC(MeCNAr)  2  ]  &#8208;  ; Ar = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dip) or 2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylphenyl (TCHP)) with blue or UV light, leads to double reduction of benzene and formation of the &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; cyclohexadienediyl bridged compounds, [{(  Ar  Nacnac)Mg}  2  (&#956;&#8208;C  6  H  6  )]. Irradiation of [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ] in toluene, and each of the three isomers of xylene, promoted completely regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective C&#8211;H bond activations, and formation of [(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg(Ar&#8217;)] (Ar&#8217; =  meta  &#8208;tolyl; 2,3&#8208;, 3,5&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl), and [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}  2  ]. Fluorobenzene was cleanly defluorinated by photoactivated [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ], leading to biphenyl and [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}  2  ]. Computational studies suggest all reactions proceed  via  photochemically generated magnesium(I) radicals, which reduce the arene substrate, before C&#8211;H or C&#8211;F bond activation processes occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Intramolecular Electric Field Construction in Metal Phthalocyanine as Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Material for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;21% Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTs realizes a record value of 21.23% (certified 21.03%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Converting CO  2  and H  2  O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#65293;Ni&#8208;doped CoS  2  nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS  2  ). The evolution rate of CH  4  over Ni&#8208;CoS  2  is up to 101.8 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS  2  with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH  4  &#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS  2  could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH  4  . This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>The formation/decomposition equilibrium of LiH and its contribution on anode failure in practical lithium metal batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Discovering the underlying reason for Li anode failure is a critical step towards applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, we conduct deuterium&#8208;oxide (D2O) titration experiments in a novel on&#8208;line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO2/Li LMBs. The practical cell is comprised of ultrathin Li anode (50 &#956;m), high loading LiCoO2 (17 mg cm&#8208;2, 2.805 mAh cm&#8208;2) and different formulated electrolytes. Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2H2 &#8652; LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode. We believe that the unusual understanding provided by this study will draw forth more insightful efforts to realize efficient Li protection and the ultimate applications of &#8220;holy grail&#8221; LMBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
      <dc:description>We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor&#8208;binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA&#8208;approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitamin D); retinoids (some known to be active  in vitro  , and vitamin A); and vitamin K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.</dc:description>

      <title>Cryptic sulfur incorporation in thioangucycline biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur&#8208;containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of&#160;  in vitro  &#160;and&#160;  in vivo  &#160;experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non&#8208;enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide.

      <title>Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO2 utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO2 reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO2 molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The insights will be corroborated with the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive potential strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of possible products.

     alt="Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The insights will be corroborated with the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive potential strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of possible products.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Activation Mechanism for Denitrogenative Rearrangement Over C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination</title>
      <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative rearrangement of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazole is developed over the competitive C(sp  3  )&#8211;H amination. This catalytic rearrangement reaction follows an unprecedented metalloradical activation mechanism. Employing the developed method, a wide number of complex&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic product classes have been accessed. The synthetic utility of this radical activation method is showcased with the short synthesis of a bioactive molecule. Collectively, this discovery underlines the progress of radical activation strategy that should find wide application in the perspective of medicinal chemistry, drug discovery and natural product synthesis research.</dc:description>

      <title>Vapochromic Behaviors of A Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Polymer Based on Exo&#8208;Wall Complexation of Perethylated Pillar[5]arene with 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene</title>
      <dc:description>The research for the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymers with specific functions accelerates the development of supramolecular and materials sciences. Here, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (  EtP5  ) with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (  TCNB  ) in various solvents. Driven by charge&#8208;transfer interaction,  TCNB  is enclosed in the cavity of  EtP5  in CHCl  3  , while  TCNB  complexes with  EtP5  at the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  in CH  2  Cl  2  . This is because the size of CH  2  Cl  2  matches the cavity of  EtP5  , forcing  TCNB  to complex with the exo&#8208;wall of  EtP5  . Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo&#8208;wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of  EtP5  based on C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge&#8208;transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor&#8208;capture in the solid&#8208;state supramolecular polymer.</dc:description>

      <title>Orthogonal Regulation of Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Couplings between Indazoles and Isoprene</title>
      <dc:description>Depending on the reactant property and reaction mechanism, one major regioisomer can be favored in a reaction that involves multiple active sites. Herein, an orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the regiodivergent hydroamination of isoprene with indazoles is demonstrated. Under Pd&#8208;hydride catalysis, the 1,2&#8208; or 4,3&#8208;insertion pathway with respect to the electrophilic sites on isoprene could be controlled by the choice of ligands. In terms of the nucleophilic sites on indazoles, the reaction occurs at either the  N1&#8208; or  N2&#8208;position of indazoles is governed by the acid co&#8208;catalysts. Preliminary experimental studies have been performed to rationalize the mechanism and regioselectivity. This study not only contributes a practical tool for selective functionalization of isoprene, but also provides a guide to manipulate the regioselectivity for the  N&#8208;functionalization of indazoles.</dc:description>

      <title>Hexagonal RuSe2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials have emerged as promising alternatives to platinum (Pt) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the family of layered TMDs is mainly limited to Group IV&#8208;VII transition metals, while the synthesis of other group metals based layered TMDs still remains a challenge. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate by atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy that hexagonal RuSe2 (h&#8208;RuSe2) nanosheets with the mixture of 2H and 1T phases, a new member of layered TMDs family, can be obtained by a facile bottom&#8208;up colloidal synthetic approach. The obtained h&#8208;RuSe2, which can be transferred into the thermodynamically favorable phase of cubic RuSe2 (c&#8208;RuSe2) only after annealing at 600 &#176;C, exhibits Pt&#8208;like HER performance, with a 5&#8208;fold turnover frequency enhancement compared to the c&#8208;RuSe2 under alkaline media. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced adsorption free energies of H2O (&#916;GH2O*), optimized adsorption free energies of H (&#916;GH*) and increased conductivity of h&#8208;RuSe2 contribute to its superior HER activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an &#160; enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#160;  porphyrin  &#160;  1  as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex&#160;  1  , which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole&#8208;free analogue&#160;  2  , with an anodic shift of ORR half&#8208;wave potential by 160 mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150 mV to get the benchmark current density at 10 mA/cm  2  . Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal Fe  V  =O form the O&#8722;O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of&#160;  trans  &#160;HO&#8722;Fe  V  =O, which is less effective to form O&#8722;O bond with hydroxide.

      <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
      <dc:description>Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8208;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using  in situ  IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO  2  formation rates than Pd alone.</dc:description>

      <title>A large starphene comprising pentacene branches</title>
      <dc:description>Starphenes are attractive compounds due to their characteristic physicochemical properties that are inherited from acenes, making them interesting compounds for organic electronics and optics. However, the instability and low solubility of larger starphene homologs make their synthesis extremely challenging. Herein, we present a new strategy leading to pristine [16]starphene in preparative scale. Our approach is based on a synthesis of a carbonyl&#8208;protected starphene precursor that is thermally converted in a solid&#8208;state form to the neat [16]starphene, which is then characterised with a variety of analytical methods, such as  13  C CP&#8208;MAS NMR, TGA, MS MALDI, UV&#8208;Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;resolution STM experiments unambiguously confirm its expected structure and reveal a moderate electronic delocalisation between the pentacene arms. Nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts NICS(1) are also calculated to survey its aromatic character.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of a platinum&#8208;catalyzed desaturation of cyclic ketones to their conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated counterparts is reported in this full article. A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation. The reaction operates under mild conditions without using strong bases or acids. Good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds. A wide range of functional groups, including those sensitive to acids, bases/nucleophiles or palladium species, are tolerated, which represents a distinct feature from other known desaturation methods. Mechanistically, this platinum catalysis exhibits a fast and reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by a rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination process, which is different from the prior Pd&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method.

      <title>Imaging and analysis of isomeric unsaturated lipids through online photochemical derivatization of C=C bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer&#8208;level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments, which reveal the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. In spite of their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an  N  &#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.</dc:description>

      <title>Minimization of Back&#8208;Electron Transfer Enables the Elusive sp3 C&#8211;H Functionalization of Secondary Anilines</title>
      <dc:description>Anilines are some of the most used class of substrates for application in photoinduced electron transfer.  N  ,  N  &#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;derivatives enable radical generation a to the  N  &#8208;atom by oxidation followed by deprotonation. This approach is however elusive to monosubstituted anilines owing to fast back&#8208;electron transfer (BET). Here we demonstrate that BET can be effectively minimised by using photoredox catalysis in the presence of an exogenous alkylamine. This approach synergistically aids aniline SET oxidation and then accelerates the following deprotonation. In this way, the generation of a&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals is now possible and these species can be used in a general sense to achieve divergent sp  3  C&#8211;H functionalization.</dc:description>

A collection of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) wireframe structures are presented to showcase the simple and versatile design scheme. Our development reveals more of the ever&#8208;expanding design space of structural DNA nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enhanced light&#8208;driven hydrogen production by self&#8208;photosensitized biohybrid systems</title>
      <dc:description>Storage of solar energy as hydrogen provides a platform towards decarbonizing our economy. One emerging strategy for solar fuels production is to use photocatalytic biohybrid systems combining the high catalytic activity of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms with the high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency of metal semiconductor nanoparticles. However, few such systems have been tested for H  2  production. We investigated light&#8208;driven H  2  production by three novel organisms,  Desulfovibrio desulfuricans  ,  Citrobacter freundii,  and  Shewanella oneidensis  , self&#8208;photosensitized with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, and compared their performance to  Escherichia coli  . All biohybrid systems produced H  2  from light, with  D. desulfuricans  &#8208;CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H  2  was continuously produced for more than 10 days with a specific rate of 36 &#181;mol.g  dcw  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  . High apparent quantum yields of 23% and 4% were obtained, with and without methyl viologen, respectively, exceeding values previously reported.</dc:description>

In this report, we established a photophysics&#8208;electronics correlation for actinide&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (An&#8208;MOFs) as a function of excitation wavelength, for the first time. A stepwise approach for dynamically modulating electronic properties was applied for the first time towards actinide&#8208;based heterometallic MOFs through integration of photochromic linkers.

Furthermore, the first photochromic MOF&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, in which the field&#8208;effect response could be changed through light exposure was constructed.

      <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. While applying RAFT photopolymerization to additive manufacturing has been explored in some early works, these systems are unable to produce commercially viable build speeds and are only printable if high concentrations of a select few divinyl crosslinking monomers are used. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation (&#955;max = 405 nm). The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1 cm/h, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object. The rapidly curing photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT 3D printing process reported herein paves the way for a new generation of previously unprintable RAFT functionalized materials to be printed with high resolution and at commercially competitive build speeds.</dc:description>

      <title>Construct Sturdy Packing of Self&#8208;Assembling Iridium Complex via Endocytic Trafficking for Long&#8208;Term Lysosome Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>Live cell imaging of lysosome positioning and motility is critical to the study of lysosome status and function for pharmacological interventions. To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we design and synthesize an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies transform from nanoparticles to sturdy packed networks stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescent intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.</dc:description>

To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we design and synthesize an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies transform from nanoparticles to sturdy packed networks stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescent intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The design of a GLP&#8208;1/PYY dual acting agonist</title>
      <dc:description>The two gut hormones GLP&#8208;1 and PYY  3&#8208;36  , which are both secreted from the L&#8208;cells upon food stimuli, have a stronger inhibitory effect on food intake when they are combined, compared to their individual effects as single agonists. Although they are not homologous and share no sequence similarity, we show that a GLP&#8208;1 analogue can be designed to exhibit potent activity on both the Y  2  and GLP&#8208;1 receptors. Dual acting hybrid analogues were realized by designing truncated and potent Y  2  receptor PYY analogues, followed by integrating the critical residues into GLP&#8208;1. In this study, we show that one of these dual acting agonists acutely reduces food intake significantly more than the respective mono&#8208;agonist counterparts.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable De Novo Synthesis of Aldgarose and Total Synthesis of Aldgamycin N</title>
      <dc:description>Since the accompanying study had shown that the introduction of the eponymous aldgarose sugar to the C5&#8208;OH group of the macrocyclic aglycone of aldgamycin N is most difficult, if not even impossible, the synthesis route was revised and the critical glycosidation performed at an earlier stage. To mitigate the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this precious branched octose was developed. The actual glycoside formation required exceptionally mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the many polar peripheral groups in the resulting product did not impede the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: specifically, the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed  trans  &#8208;hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling.

      <title>Strong Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two&#8208;dimensional Na&#8208;In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
      <dc:description>Soft lattice and strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently, therefore LDP represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emitters for applications in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Cs  2  NaInCl  6  , we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)  4  NaInCl  8  : Sb (PEA = phenethylamine) and (PEA)  2  CsNaInCl  7  : Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb&#8208;doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7% (mono&#8208;) and 29.3% (bi&#8208;), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  octahedron. Our results provide important insights for designing LDPs with broadband emissions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A series of rigid nonconjugated polyimide (PI)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers were reported for the first time, based on a &#8220;&#8208;TADF&#8208;Linker&#8208;Host&#8208;&#8221;strategy. Among of which, the TADF unit contains a typical TADF luminous core structure, the host unit exhibits effective conjugation length that endows polyimide with high triplet energy, and the linker unit has an aliphatic ring structure to improve solubility and inhibit intramolecular charge transfer effect, thus making the polymers exhibit the TADF property of the TADF unit. All the TADF polyimides exhibit high thermal stability (  T  g  &gt; 308  o  C) and refractive index (1.76&#8208;1.79). Remarkably, highly&#8208;efficient polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on the polymers are successfully realized, leading to a maximal external quantum efficiency of 21.0% along with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Such an outstanding efficiency is amongst the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of nonconjugated PLEDs, confirming the effectiveness of our structural design strategy, providing helpful and valuable guidance on the development of highly&#8208;efficient fluorescent polymer materials and PLEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Triggered Chain Reactions for the Conversion of Furan Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>We report an electrochemical method for coupling biomass&#8208;derived C5/C6 compounds to value&#8208;added fuel precursors.&#160; Using only 2% of equivalent charges, 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF) was oxidized to yield a cation radical, which readily reacted with 3&#8208;hexene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, a derivate of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran, to produce 3&#8208;(5&#8208;methylfuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)hexane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione.&#160; The product was converted to 4&#8208;ethylnonane (a component of biodiesel/jet fuel) in a single step in excellent yield. Importantly, the reaction was not sensitive to oxygen, and a trace amount of water was found to promote the reaction. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed the proposed reaction pathways.&#160; Key to the mechanism is the radical generation that is enabled by electrochemistry. The radical is regenerated at the end of a reaction cycle to ensure chain propagation for an average of ca. 47 times, resulting in an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4,700%.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Functionalized Aldimines as 1,4&#8208;Dipoles</title>
      <dc:description>The use of functionalized aldimines has been demonstrated as newly structural 1,4&#8208;dipole precursors under carbene catalysis. More importantly, enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed using carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles with quaternary carbon centers. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and good enantiomeric ratio. DFT calculation results indicated that hydrogen bond C&#8208;H&#8230;F interactions between the catalyst and substrate are the key factors for controlling and even switching the enantioselectivity. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Metal Ion Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Zn/MnO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The co&#8208;insertion of dual ions can often offer enhanced electrochemical performance for the aqueous zinc batteries. Although the insertion of non&#8208;metallic ions has been achieved in aqueous zinc batteries, the co&#8208;insertion chemistry of non&#8208;metallic cations is still a challenge. Here, a reversible H  +  /NH  4  +  co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism was developed in an aqueous Zn/MnO  2  battery system. The synergistic effect between the dual cations endows the aqueous batteries with the fast kinetics of ion diffusion and the reversible structure evolution of MnO  2  . As a result, the Zn/MnO  2  battery displays excellent rate capability and cycling performance. This work will pave the way toward the design of aqueous rechargeable batteries with non&#8208;metallic ions.</dc:description>
