      <title>The Sphingosine and Acyl Chains of Ceramide [NS] Show Very Different Structure and Dynamics Challenging Our Understanding of the Skin Barrier</title>
      <dc:description>The lipid phase of the uppermost human skin layer is thought to comprise highly rigid lipids in an orthorhombic phase state to protect the body against the environment. By synthesizing sphin&#173;gosine&#8208;  d  28  deuterated  N&#8208;  lignoceroyl&#8208;D&#8208;  erythro&#8208;  sphingosine (cerami&#173;de [NS]), we compare the structure and dynamics of both chains of that lipid in biologically relevant mixtures using X&#8208;ray diffraction,  2  H NMR and infrared spectroscopy. Our results reveal a substantial fraction of sphingosine chains in a fluid and dynamic phase state at physiological temperature. These findings prompt revision of our cur&#173;rent understanding of the skin lipid barrier, where an extended cera&#173;mide [NS] conformation is preferred and a possible domain structure is proposed. Mobile lipid chains may be crucial for skin elasticity and the translocation of physiologically important molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Computational Investigation of Bright Orange&#8208;emitting Benzothiadiazole [10]Cycloparaphenylene</title>

      <dc:description>Emerged as a cost&#8208;effective and robust enzyme mimic, nanozymes have drawn increasing attention with broad applications ranging from cancer therapy to biosensing. Developing nanozymes with both accelerated and inhibited biocatalytic properties in a biological context is intriguing to peruse more advanced functions of natural enzymes, but remains challenging, because most nanozymes are lack of enzyme&#8208;like molecular structures.

      <title>Quantum defects as a toolbox for covalent carbon nanotube functionalization with peptides and proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are a 1D nanomaterial that shows fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR, &gt;&#160;800&#160;nm). In the past, covalent chemistry was less explored to functionalize SWCNTs as it impairs NIR emission. However, certain sp  3  &#160;defects (quantum defects) in the carbon lattice have emerged that preserve NIR fluorescence and even introduce a new, red&#8208;shifted emission peak. Here, we report on quantum defects, introduced using light&#8208;driven diazonium chemistry, that serve as anchor points for peptides and proteins. We show that maleimide anchors allow conjugation of cysteine&#8208;containing proteins such as a GFP&#8208;binding nanobody. In addition, a Fmoc protected phenylalanine defect serves as a starting point for conjugation of visible fluorophores to create multicolor SWCNTs and in situ peptide synthesis directly on the nanotube. Therefore, these quantum defects are a versatile platform to tailor both the nanotube&#8217;s photophysical properties as well as their surface chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Induced&#8208;Fitting and Polarization of Bromine Molecule in an Electrophilic Inorganic Molecular Cavity and Its Bromination Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Dodecavanadate, [V  12  O  32  ]  4&#8722;  (  V12  ), possesses a 4.4 &#197; cavity entrance, and the cavity shows unique electrophilicity. Due to the high polarizability, Br  2  was inserted into  V12  , inducing the inversion of one of the VO  5  square pyramids to form [V  12  O  32  (Br  2  )]  4&#8722;  (  V12(Br2)  ). The inserted Br  2  molecule was polarized and showed a peak at 185 cm  &#8722;1  in the IR spectrum. The reaction of  V12(Br2)  and toluene yielded bromination of toluene at the ring, showing the electrophilicity of the inserted Br  2  molecule. Compound  V12(Br2)  also reacted with propane,  n  &#8208;butane, and  n  &#8208;pentane to give brominated alkanes. Bromination with  V12(Br2)  showed high selectivity for 3&#8208;bromopentane (64%) among the monobromopentane products and preferred  threo  isomer among 2&#8208;,3&#8208;dibromobutane and 2,3&#8208;dibromopenane. The unique inorganic cavity traps Br  2  leading the polarization of the diatomic molecule. Due to its new reaction field, the trapped Br  2  shows selective functionalization of alkanes.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dodecavanadate, [V  12  O  32  ]  4&#8722;  (  V12  ), possesses a 4.4 &#197; cavity entrance, and the cavity shows unique electrophilicity. Due to the high polarizability, Br  2  was inserted into  V12  , inducing the inversion of one of the VO  5  square pyramids to form [V  12  O  32  (Br  2  )]  4&#8722;  (  V12(Br2)  ). The inserted Br  2  molecule was polarized and showed a peak at 185 cm  &#8722;1  in the IR spectrum. The reaction of  V12(Br2)  and toluene yielded bromination of toluene at the ring, showing the electrophilicity of the inserted Br  2  molecule. Compound  V12(Br2)  also reacted with propane,  n  &#8208;butane, and  n  &#8208;pentane to give brominated alkanes. Bromination with  V12(Br2)  showed high selectivity for 3&#8208;bromopentane (64%) among the monobromopentane products and preferred  threo  isomer among 2&#8208;,3&#8208;dibromobutane and 2,3&#8208;dibromopenane. The unique inorganic cavity traps Br  2  leading the polarization of the diatomic molecule. Due to its new reaction field, the trapped Br  2  shows selective functionalization of alkanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis and Post&#8208;Synthesis Transformation of Germanosilicate Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are one of the most important heterogeneous catalysts, with a high number of large&#8208;scale industrial applications. While the synthesis of new zeolites remain rather limited, introduction of germanium has substantially increased our ability to not only direct the synthesis of zeolites but also to convert them into new materials post&#8208;synthetically. The smaller Ge&#8208;O&#8208;Ge angles (vs. Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si) and lability of Ge&#8208;O bonds in aqueous solutions account for this behaviour.

      <title>Mutant&#8208;Selective Allosteric EGFR Degraders are Effective Against a Broad Range of Drug&#8208;Resistant Mutations</title>
      <dc:description>Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through an allosteric mechanism provides a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome drug&#8208;resistant EGFR mutations that emerge within the ATP binding site. Here, we develop an allosteric EGFR degrader, DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163, which can selectively inhibit the proliferation of L858R/T790 (L/T) mutant Ba/F3 cells while leaving wildtype EGFR Ba/F3 cells unaffected. DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 is also effective against osimertinib&#8208;resistant cells with L/T/C797S and L/T/L718Q EGFR mutations. When combined with an ATP&#8208;site EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, the anti&#8208;proliferative activity of DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 against L858R/T790M EGFR&#8208;Ba/F3 cells is enhanced. Collectively, DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 is a promising allosteric EGFR degrader with selective activity against various clinically relevant EGFR mutants as a single agent and when combined with an ATP&#8208;site inhibitor. Our data suggests that targeted protein degradation is a promising drug development approach for mutant EGFR.</dc:description>

      <title>The Mechanism of the Magnetodielectric Response in a Molecule&#8208;Based Trinuclear Iron Cluster Material</title>
      <dc:description>Magnetodielectric response mechanisms are critical for the rational design and synthesis of molecule&#8208;based magnetodielectric materials. Herein, the magnetodielectric response was investigated in the molecule&#8208;based material [Fe  3  O(CH  3  COO)  6  (py)  3  ](py) (  1  ). Its magnetodielectric coefficient (MD) is &#8208;2.8% for phase transition III and &#8208;4.1% for phase transition I. Study of the mechanism of the magnetodielectric response in  1  reveals that its magnetodielectric response at phase transition I is induced by the charge&#8208;frustration of the trinuclear iron cluster, while that at phase transition III is attributed to the spin&#8208;frustration of the trinuclear iron cluster, providing a new route for the design of magnetodielectric materials.</dc:description>

Specifically, dinickelaferrocene 2, a type of dimetallametallocene, is efficiently synthesized from the reaction of dilithionickelole 1 with FeBr2 or FeCl2 presumably via a redox process, and is subjected to detailed experimental (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, ICP&#8208;OES, magnetometry, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, XPS) and theoretical (MOs, CDA, NICS, ICSS, and AICD) characterizations. Unlike ferrocene and its Cp ligands, it is found that the aromaticity of dinickelaferrocene and its nickelole ligands is accomplished by electron back donation from the Fe 3d orbitals to the &#960;* orbitals of nickelole. Taken together, this work describes a new class of metallaferrocene sandwich complexes and provides a novel approach to effect aromaticity that will contribute to further development of metallocene chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Single Molecule Redox&#8208;targeting Reactions for a pH&#8208;neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have recently received considerable attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Among them, quinone derivatives such as 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonate (2,7&#8208;AQDS), have been explored intensively due to its potentially low cost and swift reaction kinetics. However, the low solubility in pH&#8208;neutral electrolytes restricts their application to corrosive acidic or caustic systems. Herein, we report the single molecule redox&#8208;targeting reactions of 2,7&#8208;AQDS anolyte to circumvent its solubility limit in pH&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Polyimide was employed as a low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity solid material to boost the capacity of 2,7&#8208;AQDS electrolyte to 97 Ah/L. Through  in&#8208;situ  FTIR spectroscopic study, a hydrogen&#8208;bonding mediated reaction mechanism was disclosed. In conjunction with NaI as catholyte and nickel hexacyanoferrate as the catholyte capacity booster, a single molecule redox&#8208;targeting reaction&#8208;based full cell with energy density up to 39 Wh/L was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Excimer and Exciplex Formation in Gold(I) Complexes Preconditioned by Aurophilic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Bond formation through excitation: Linear, two&#8208;coordinate gold(I) complexes are known to aggregate side&#8208;on through aurophilic interactions. The resulting weak Au&#8211;Au contacts are strengthened upon UV irradiation as evidenced by a shortening of the intermetallic distance and the vibrational and electronic absorption and emission characteristics of the resulting excimers. The changes in the redox potentials make [AuI&#8722;AuI]* excimers useful intermediates in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Excimers and exciplexes are defined as assemblies of atoms or molecules A/A&#8242; where interatomic/intermolecular bonding appears only in excited states such as [A2]* (for excimers) and [AA&#8242;]* (for exciplexes). Their formation has become widely known because of their role in gas&#8208;phase laser technologies, but their significance in general chemistry terms has been given little attention. Recent investigations in gold chemistry have opened up a new field of excimer and exciplex chemistry that relies largely on the preorganization of gold(I) compounds (electronic configuration AuI(5d10)) through aurophilic contacts. In the corresponding excimers, a new type of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au bonding arises, with bond energies and lengths approaching those of ground&#8208;state Au&#8722;Au bonds between metal atoms in the Au0(5d106s1) and AuII(5d9) configurations. Excimer formation gives rise to a broad range of photophysical effects, for which some of the relaxation dynamics have recently been clarified. Excimers have also been shown to play an important role in photoredox binuclear gold catalysis.

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;I: Progress</title>
      <dc:description>
The contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences is discussed in this two&#8208;part Review. This first part describes how discoveries of physical matter, processes, and models are unified as search problems; what to consider when assessing the extent of autonomy in a discovery; and many examples of discoveries in synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this first part, we describe a classification for discoveries of physical matter (molecules, materials, devices), processes, and models and how they are unified as search problems. We then introduce a set of questions and considerations relevant to assessing the extent of autonomy. Finally, we describe many case studies of discoveries accelerated by or resulting from computer assistance and automation from the domains of synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science. These illustrate how rapid advancements in hardware automation and machine learning continue to transform the nature of experimentation and modeling. Part two reflects on these case studies and identifies a set of open challenges for the field.

      <title>Maximization of Spatial Charge Density: An Approach to Ultrahigh Energy Density of Capacitive Charge Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Capacitive energy storage possesses the advantages of high power density, long lifespan, and good security, but is severely restricted by its low energy density. Inspired by the charge storage mechanism of batteries, we develop a spatial charge density (SCD) maximization strategy to compensate this shortage by densely and neatly packing the ionic charges in capacitive materials. Accordingly, a record high SCD of ~550 C cm&#8722;3  was achieved by balancing the valance and size of charge&#8208;carrier ions and matching the ion sizes with the pore structure of electrode materials, which is nearly five times higher than those of conventional ones (~120 C cm&#8722;3  ). The maximization of SCD was confirmed by Monte Carlo calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy. As a result, a full&#8208;cell supercapacitor was constructed and it delivers an ultrahigh energy density of 165 W h L&#8722;1  at the power density of 150 W L&#8722;1  , and retains 120 W h L&#8722;1  even at 36 kW L&#8722;1  , opening a pathway towards high energy density capacitive energy storages.</dc:description>

      <title>Mixed Anionic and Cationic Redox Chemistry in a Tetrathiomolybdate Amorphous Coordination Framework</title>
      <dc:description>We report the electrochemistry of a hitherto unexplored Na2MoS4  phase as conversion electrode material for Na&#8208; and Li&#8208;cation reversible storage. The material adopts an amorphous coordination polymer structure, with mixed Mo and S valences. Ex&#8208;situ XPS and in&#8208;situ XRD analysis reveal a complex interplay between Mo and S redox, while excluding the formation of free sulfur, lithium sulfide or other crystalline phases. Na2MoS4  behaves as a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor, with electronic conductivity of 6.1 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  , that allowed the use of this material without any conductive carbon in an electrochemical cell. A reversible capacity of 500 mAh g  &#8208;1  is attained corresponding to 5&#8208;electron redox exchange, with the end&#8208;member reaching from Na&lt;1MoS4  to Na&gt;5MoS4  .

      <dc:description>We report core@satellite Janus mesoporous silica&#8211;Pt@Au (JMPA) nanomotors that are capable of pH&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;phoretic propulsion. The JMPA nanomotors first undergo self&#8208;diffusiophoretic propulsion in 3.0% H2O2 due to the isolated status between Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and PtNPs layer. Then the weak acidity of H2O2 can trigger the disassembly and reassembly of AuNPs, resulting in the Janus distribution of large AuNPs aggregates. Such reconstruction of JMPA leads to the contact between PtNPs and AuNPs aggregates, thus tailoring the propulsion mechanism to self&#8208;electrophoresis. The asymmetric and aggregated AuNPs also enable the generation of thermal gradient under laser irradiation, which propels the JMPA nanomotors by self&#8208;thermophoresis. Such multi&#8208;phoretic propulsion offers considerable promise for developing advanced nanomachines with a stimuli&#8208;responsive switch of propulsion modes in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrochromic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrochromic materials that can reversibly change color upon water treatment have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in diverse fields. Here, for the first time, we report that space&#8208;confined CsPbBr  3  &#160;nanocrystals (NCs) are hydrochromic. When CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs are loaded into a porous matrix, reversible transition between luminescent CsPbBr  3  &#160;and non&#8208;luminescent CsPb  2  Br  5  &#160;can be achieved upon the exposure/removal of water. The potential applications of hydrochromic CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs in anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated by using CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs@mesoporous silica nanospheres (around 100 nm) as the starting material. Due to the small particle size and negatively charged surface, the as&#8208;prepared particles can be laser&#8208;jet printed with high precision and high speed. We demonstrate the excellent stability over repeated transformation cycles without color fade. This new discovery may not only deepen the understanding of CsPbX  3  , but also open a new way to design CsPbX  3  &#160;materials for new applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent Organic Framework for Improving Near&#8208;Infrared Light Induced Fluorescence Imaging through Two&#8208;Photon Induction</title>
      <dc:description>
A new image: A benzothiadiazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework is reported to promote two&#8208;photon induction and to overcome the aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of the chromophores. The design improves upon current near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence imaging techniques.







Abstract
Fluorescent materials exhibiting two&#8208;photon induction (TPI) are used for nonlinear optics, bioimaging, and phototherapy. Polymerizations of molecular chromophores to form &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures were hindered by the lack of long&#8208;range ordering in the structure and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the chromophores. Reported here is the rational design of a benzothiadiazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) for promoting TPI and obtaining efficient two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence emissions. Characterization and spectroscopic data revealed that the enhancement in TPI performance is attributed to the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor configuration and regular intervals of the chromophores, the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation domain, and the long&#8208;range order of COF crystals. The crystalline structure of TPI&#8208;COF attenuates the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the layers, and overcomes aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of the chromophores for improving near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence imaging.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent materials exhibiting two&#8208;photon induction (TPI) are used for nonlinear optics, bioimaging, and phototherapy. Polymerizations of molecular chromophores to form &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures were hindered by the lack of long&#8208;range ordering in the structure and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the chromophores. Reported here is the rational design of a benzothiadiazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) for promoting TPI and obtaining efficient two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence emissions. Characterization and spectroscopic data revealed that the enhancement in TPI performance is attributed to the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor configuration and regular intervals of the chromophores, the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation domain, and the long&#8208;range order of COF crystals. The crystalline structure of TPI&#8208;COF attenuates the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the layers, and overcomes aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of the chromophores for improving near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Free Patterning of Cooperative&#8208;Thermoresponse Images by the Synergy of the AIEgen with the Liquid Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperation without talking: An AIEgen/liquid crystal (LC) system with unique synergistic interactions was designed to pattern noninterference images (holographic and fluorescent) with unprecedented cooperative thermoresponse. The AIEgen's fluorescence intensity is controlled by the LC, while the LC's phase transition is in turn promoted by the AIEgen.







Abstract
Patterning multiple images within a single element without crosstalk can significantly increase the information capacity and security, but it is challenging to enable the response capability in each image. Now, the patterning of crosstalk&#8208;free yet cooperative&#8208;thermoresponse images (holographic and fluorescent images) is successfully achieved by designing a liquid crystal (LC)/AIEgen system with a unique synergy. The AIEgen's fluorescence intensity is controlled by the LC, while the LC's phase transition is in turn promoted by the AIEgen. The fluorescent image contrast is significantly boosted by efficient energy transfer (&#934;ET: 96&#8201;%) from the LC to the AIEgen. The AIEgen's photocyclization for fluorescent patterning occurs in a zero&#8208;order kinetic manner and can be completed within several minutes when assisted by the LC. The photocyclization conversion is quantitatively dependent on the aggregation size: &#945;&#8764;exp(&#8208;d), and able to reach as high as 98&#8201;%.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Highly Stable Zirconium(IV) Coordination Cages with Aggregation Induced Emission Molecular Rotors for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly stable coordination cages with trinuclear zirconium vertices and flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers were formed by self&#8208;assembly.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of highly stable zirconium(IV)&#8208;based coordination cages with aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecular rotors for in&#8197;vitro bio&#8208;imaging is reported. The two coordination cages, NUS&#8208;100 and NUS&#8208;101, are assembled from the highly stable trinuclear zirconium vertices and two flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers. Extensive experimental and theoretical results show that the emissive intensity of the coordination cages can be controlled by restricting the dynamics of AIE&#8208;active molecular rotors though multiple external stimuli. Because the two coordination cages have excellent chemical stability in aqueous solutions (pH stability: 2&#8211;10) and impressive AIE characteristics contributed by the molecular rotors, they can be employed as novel biological fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vitro live&#8208;cell imaging.

      <title>A Supramolecular Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Two&#8208;Step Sequential Energy Transfer for Photochemical Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
It takes two to FRET: An artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a two&#8208;step sequential energy&#8208;transfer process in a relay mode was fabricated using a supramolecular strategy. It can be used as a nanoreactor for efficient photochemical catalysis. Moreover, bright white light emission can be successfully achieved with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.33).







Abstract
An artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy&#8208;transfer process was fabricated based on a supramolecular strategy. Self&#8208;assembled from the host&#8211;guest complex formed by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), a bola&#8208;type tetraphenylethylene&#8208;functionalized dialkyl ammonium derivative (TPEDA), and two fluorescent dyes, Eosin Y (ESY) and Nile Red (NiR), the supramolecular vesicles achieve efficient energy transfer from the AIE guest TPEDA to ESY. ESY can function as a relay to further transfer the energy to the second acceptor NiR and realize a two&#8208;step sequential energy&#8208;transfer process with good efficiency. By tuning the donor/acceptor ratio, bright white light emission can be successfully achieved with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.33). To better mimic natural photosynthesis and make full use of the harvested energy, the WP5&#8835;TPEDA&#8208;ESY&#8208;NiR system can be utilized as a nanoreactor: photocatalyzed dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone was realized with 96&#8201;% yield in aqueous medium.

      <title>Crystallization&#8208;Induced Reversal from Dark to Bright Excited States for Construction of Solid&#8208;Emission&#8208;Tunable Squaraines</title>
      <dc:description>
A unique squaraine, CIEE&#8208;SQ, exhibits strong emission in the crystal, undergoing crystallization&#8208;induced reversal from dark 1(n+&#963;,&#960;*) to bright 1(&#960;,&#960;*) excited states. Such an excited state can be tuned by an unexpected temperature&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reversible transformation. Co&#8208;crystallization between CIEE&#8208;SQ and chloroform largely boosts the fluorescence.







Abstract
Squaraines (SQs) with tunable emission in the solid state is of great importance for various demands; however a remaining challenge is emission quenching upon aggregation. Herein, a unique SQ, named as CIEE&#8208;SQ, is designed to exhibit strong emission in crystal, undergoing crystallization&#8208;induced reverse from dark 1(n+&#963;,&#960;*) to bright 1(&#960;,&#960;*) excited states. Such an excited state of CIEE&#8208;SQ can be subtly tuned by molecular conformation changes during the unexpected temperature&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reversible transformation. Furthermore, co&#8208;crystallization between CIEE&#8208;SQ and chloroform largely stabilize the 1(&#960;,&#960;*) state, enhancing the transition dipole moment and decreasing the reorganization energy to boost the fluorescence, which is promising in data encryption and decryption.

      <title>AIE Triggers the Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Atomically Precise Enantiomeric Copper(I) Alkynyl Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically precise chiral CuI alkynyl nanoclusters R/S&#8208;Cu14 with inherent chirality were synthesized for the first time. Crystallization&#8208; and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (CIE and AIE, respectively) trigger circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an unprecedented luminescence anisotropy factor (glum).







Abstract
Atomically precise enantiomeric metal clusters are scarce, and copper(I) alkynyl clusters with intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses have not been reported. A pair of chiral alkynyl ligands, (R/S)&#8208;2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxylmethylpyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;propyne (abbreviated as R/S&#8208;DPM) we successfully prepared and single crystals were characterized of optically pure enantiomeric pair of atomically&#8208;precise copper(I) clusters, [Cu14(R/S&#8208;DPM)8](PF6)6 (denoted as R/S&#8208;Cu14), which feature bright red luminescence and CPL with a high luminescence anisotropy factor (glum). A dilute solution containing R/S&#8208;Cu14 was nonluminescent and CPL inactive at room temperature. Crystallization&#8208; and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (CIE and AIE, respectively) contribute to the triggering of the CPL of R/S&#8208;Cu14 in the crystalline and aggregated states. Their AIE behavior and good biocompatibility indicated applications of these copper(I) clusters in cell imaging in HeLa and NG108&#8208;15 cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Atomically precise &lt;/b&gt; chiral Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; alkynyl nanoclusters &lt;b&gt;R/S&#8208;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/b&gt; with inherent chirality were synthesized for the first time. Crystallization&#8208; and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (CIE and AIE, respectively) trigger circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an unprecedented luminescence anisotropy factor (&lt;i&gt;g &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise enantiomeric metal clusters are scarce, and copper(I) alkynyl clusters with intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses have not been reported. A pair of chiral alkynyl ligands, (R/S)&#8208;2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxylmethylpyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;propyne (abbreviated as &lt;b&gt;R/S&#8208;DPM &lt;/b&gt;) we successfully prepared and single crystals were characterized of optically pure enantiomeric pair of atomically&#8208;precise copper(I) clusters, [Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(R/S&#8208;DPM)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as &lt;b&gt;R/S&#8208;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/b&gt;), which feature bright red luminescence and CPL with a high luminescence anisotropy factor (&lt;i&gt;g &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;). A dilute solution containing &lt;b&gt;R/S&#8208;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/b&gt; was nonluminescent and CPL inactive at room temperature. Crystallization&#8208; and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (CIE and AIE, respectively) contribute to the triggering of the CPL of &lt;b&gt;R/S&#8208;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/b&gt; in the crystalline and aggregated states. Their AIE behavior and good biocompatibility indicated applications of these copper(I) clusters in cell imaging in HeLa and NG108&#8208;15 cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hydration&#8208;Facilitated Fine&#8208;Tuning of the AIE Amphiphile Color and Application as Erasable Materials with Hot/Cold Dual Writing Modes</title>
      <dc:description>
Just add water: Hydration water on metal ions can be utilized to reversibly fine&#8208;tune the emission color of organic luminescent groups for aggregation induced emission. The hydration water can be removed by heating or mechanical grinding and re&#8208;gained by solvent fuming.







Abstract
Hydration water greatly impacts the color of inorganic crystals, but it is still unknown whether hydration water can be utilized to systematically manipulate the emission color of organic luminescent groups. Now, metal ions with different hydration ability allow fine&#8208;tuning the emission color of a fluorescent group displaying aggregation induced emission (AIE). Because the hydration water can be removed easily by gentle heating or mechanical grinding and re&#8208;gained by solvent fuming, rewritable materials can be fabricated both in the hot&#8208;writing and cold&#8208;writing modes. This hydration&#8208;facilitated strategy will open up a new vista in fine&#8208;tuning the emission color of AIE molecules based on one synthesis and in the design of smart luminescent devices.

      <title>BowtieArene: A Dual Macrocycle Exhibiting Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Colorful bowtie: The novel fluorescent dual macrocycle BowtieArene features a central tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived fluorophore, double pillar&#8208;like cavities, and solvent&#8208;, vapor&#8208;, and mechano&#8208;induced fluorochromism. The switchable fluorescence is closely related to changes in the molecular packing mode.







Abstract
Although highly useful in supramolecular chemistry, pillararenes lack a fluorophore in their skeleton. Here we present BowtieArene, a novel fluorescent dual macrocycle, featuring a central tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived fluorophore and two pillar&#8208;like, pentagon&#8208;shaped cavities which are comparable to pillar[5]arene. This concisely prepared, figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecule exhibits vapor absorption and host&#8211;guest capabilities, as well as intriguing switchable fluorescence. The fluorochromism of BowtieArene can be triggered by multiple external stimuli including solvent, vapor, and mechanical force, with excellent reversibility and stability. Experimental and theoretical evidence indicate that the fluorochromism should be closely related to molecular packing.

Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a three&#8208;dimensional tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic cage that shows host&#8211;guest recognition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. coronene) in organic media and water&#8208;soluble dyes (e.g. sulforhodamine&#8197;101) in aqueous media through CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960;, and/or electrostatic interactions. The cage&#8835;coronene exhibits a cuboid internal cavity with a size of approximately 17.2&#215;11.0&#215;6.96&#8197;&#197;3 and a &#8220;hamburger&#8221;&#8208;type host&#8211;guest complex, which is hierarchically stacked into 1D nanotubes and a 3D supramolecular framework. The free cage possesses a similar cavity in the crystalline state. Furthermore, a host&#8211;guest complex formed between the octacationic cage and sulforhodamine&#8197;101 had a higher absolute quantum yield (&#934;F=28.5&#8201;%), larger excitation&#8211;emission gap (&#916;&#955;ex&#8208;em=211&#8197;nm), and longer emission lifetime (&#964;=7.0&#8197;ns) as compared to the guest (&#934;F=10.5&#8201;%; &#916;&#955;ex&#8208;em=11&#8197;nm; &#964;=4.9&#8197;ns), and purer emission (&#916;&#955;FWHM=38&#8197;nm) as compared to the host (&#916;&#955;FWHM=111&#8197;nm).

      <title>Quantitative Design of Bright Fluorophores and AIEgens by the Accurate Prediction of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT)</title>
      <dc:description>
A generalizable and reliable computational approach is formulated for modeling the twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Applying this approach in combination with experimental validations, azetidinyl&#8208;substituted PRODAN and BODIPY derivatives were designed for bioimaging and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) applications with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Inhibition of TICT can significantly increase the brightness of fluorescent materials. Accurate prediction of TICT is thus critical for the quantitative design of high&#8208;performance fluorophores and AIEgens. TICT of 14 types of popular organic fluorophores were modeled with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). A reliable and generalizable computational approach for modeling TICT formations was established. To demonstrate the prediction power of our approach, we quantitatively designed a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based AIEgen which exhibits (almost) barrierless TICT rotations in monomers. Subsequent experiments validated our molecular design and showed that the aggregation of this compound turns on bright emissions with ca. 27&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement, as TICT formation is inhibited in molecular aggregates.

      <title>Strategy for the Construction of Diverse Poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;Derived Assemblies and Their Photoinduced Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>
Silver links: Tetrakis(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) salts H4&#8208;L(PF6)4, featuring different N4&#8197;substituents, react with Ag2O to give, depending on the length of the N4&#8197;alkyl substituent, tetranuclear metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies of type [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4 or octanuclear assemblies of type [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8. Both types of assemblies, upon irradiation, undergo oxidative photocyclization of the central tetrakisarylethylene unit to yield the complexes with a 9,10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted phenanthrene bridge.







Abstract
A series of supramolecular assemblies of types [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8 and [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4, obtained from the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bridged tetrakis(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) salts H4&#8208;L(PF6)4 and AgI ions, is described. The assembly type obtained dependends on the N&#8208;wingtip substituents of H4&#8208;L(PF6)4. Changes in the lengths of the N4&#8208;wingtip substituents enables controlled formation of assemblies with either [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4 or [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8 stoichiometry. The molecular structures of selected [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8 and [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4 assemblies were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. While H4&#8208;L(PF6)4 does not exhibit fluorescence in solution, their tetra&#8208;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) assemblies do upon NHC&#8211;metal coordination. Upon irradiation, all assemblies undergo a light&#8208;induced, supramolecule&#8208;to&#8208;supramolecule structural transformation by an oxidative photocyclization involving phenyl groups of the TPE core, resulting in a significant change of the luminescence properties.

      <title>Nanoaggregate Probe for Breast Cancer Metastasis through Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography and Aggregation&#8208;Induced NIR&#8208;I/II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable nanoprobe with AIE has been developed as a dual&#8208;mode probe for monitoring breast cancer metastasis optoacoustically and fluorescently. The focus of orthotopic breast tumors can be located through 3D multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging, and the sequential metastases of primary tumors to lymph nodes and the lung can be mapped spatiotemporally.







Abstract
An activatable nanoprobe for imaging breast cancer metastases through near infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I)/NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging was designed. With a dihydroxanthene moiety serving as the electron donor, quinolinium as the electron acceptor and nitrobenzyloxydiphenylamino as the recognition element, the probe can specifically respond to nitroreductase and transform into an activated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure with a NIR emission band extending beyond 900&#8197;nm. The activated nanoprobe exhibits NIR emission enhanced by aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and produces strong optoacoustic signal. The nanoprobe was used to detect and image metastases from the orthotopic breast tumors to lymph nodes and then to lung in two breast cancer mouse models. Moreover, the nanoprobe can monitor the treatment efficacy during chemotherapeutic course through fluorescence and MSOT imaging.

      <title>Photoactivated Fluorescence Enhancement in F,N&#8208;Doped Carbon Dots with Piezochromic Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in F and N co&#8208;doped carbon dots is presented. The F,N&#8208;doped CDs exhibit fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV and reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0&#8197;atm to 9.98&#8197;GPa), with pressure&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission in the range 1.0&#8197;atm&#8211;0.65&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Photoactivation in CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) on UV/Vis light exposure improves photoluminescence (PL) and photostability. However, it was not observed in fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CDs). Now, photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon dots (F,N&#8208;doped CDs) is presented. At 1.0&#8197;atm, the fluorescence intensity of F,N&#8208;doped CDs increases with UV light irradiation (5&#8197;s&#8211;30&#8197;min), accompanied with a blue&#8208;shift of the fluorescence emission from 586&#8197;nm to 550&#8197;nm. F,N&#8208;doped CDs exhibit photoactivated fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV under high pressure (0.1&#8197;GPa). F,N&#8208;doped CDs show reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0&#8197;atm to 9.98&#8197;GPa), showing a pressure&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission in the range 1.0&#8197;atm&#8211;0.65&#8197;GPa. The photoactivated CDs with piezochromic fluorescence enhancement broadens the versatility of CDs from ambient to high&#8208;pressure conditions and enhances their anti&#8208;photobleaching.

Now, photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon dots (F,N&#8208;doped CDs) is presented. At 1.0&#8197;atm, the fluorescence intensity of F,N&#8208;doped CDs increases with UV light irradiation (5&#8197;s&#8211;30&#8197;min), accompanied with a blue&#8208;shift of the fluorescence emission from 586&#8197;nm to 550&#8197;nm. F,N&#8208;doped CDs exhibit photoactivated fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV under high pressure (0.1&#8197;GPa). F,N&#8208;doped CDs show reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0&#8197;atm to 9.98&#8197;GPa), showing a pressure&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission in the range 1.0&#8197;atm&#8211;0.65&#8197;GPa. The photoactivated CDs with piezochromic fluorescence enhancement broadens the versatility of CDs from ambient to high&#8208;pressure conditions and enhances their anti&#8208;photobleaching.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>9,9&#8208;Dimethylxanthene Derivatives with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: Substituent Effects and Emissive Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A lifetime: Substituent effects are highlighted in 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene derivatives for the modulation of intermolecular interactions and molecular configurations, resulting in increased room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) lifetimes ranging from 52 to 601&#8197;ms. This molecular design of persistent RTP materials provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the relationship among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and RTP properties.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters with ultralong lifetimes are emerging as attractive targets because of their potential applications in bioimaging, security, and other areas. But their development is limited by ambiguous mechanisms and poor understanding of the correlation of the molecular structure and RTP properties. Herein, different substituents on the 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene core (XCO) result in compounds with RTP lifetimes ranging from 52 to 601&#8197;ms, which are tunable by intermolecular interactions and molecular configurations. XCO&#8208;PiCl shows the most persistent RTP because of its reduced steric bulk and multiple sites of the 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl (PiCl) moiety for forming intermolecular interactions in the aggregated state. The substituent effects reported provide an efficient molecular design of organic RTP materials and establishes relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and RTP properties.

      <title>Unraveling the Impact of Gold(I)&#8211;Thiolate Motifs on the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning gold: The aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of Au nanoclusters (NCs) is adjustable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared II region by controlling the length of the AuI&#8211;thiolate motifs on the NC surface. Decreasing the length of AuI&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au0&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides an efficient strategy to synthesize highly luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs), however, rational control of emission energy and intensity of metal NCs is still challenging. This communication reveals the impact of surface AuI&#8208;thiolate motifs on the AIE properties of Au NCs, by employing a series of water&#8208;soluble glutathione (GSH)&#8208;coordinated Au complexes and NCs as a model ([Au10SR10], [Au15SR13], [Au18SR14], and [Au25SR18]&#8722;, SR=thiolate ligand). Spectroscopic investigations show that the emission wavelength of Au NCs is adjustable from visible to the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) region by controlling the length of the AuI&#8208;SR motifs on the NC surface. Decreasing the length of AuI&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au0&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence. This effect becomes more prominent when the degree of aggregation of Au NCs increases in solution.

      <title>Calixarene&#8208;Based Supramolecular AIE Dots with Highly Inhibited Nonradiative Decay and Intersystem Crossing for Ultrasensitive Fluorescence Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>
      <dc:description>
Calix[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular AIE nanodots were synthesized with high quantum yields in water by virtue of the host&#8211;guest complexation. The absorbed excitation energy was mostly focused on fluorescence emission, leading to an ultrahigh signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in fluorescence&#8208;image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.







Abstract
Host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[5]arene and aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) can significantly turn off both the energy dissipation pathways of intersystem crossing and thermal deactivation, enabling the absorbed excitation energy to mostly focus on fluorescence emission. The co&#8208;assembly of calix[5]arene amphiphiles and AIEgens affords highly emissive supramolecular AIE nanodots thanks to their interaction severely restricting the intramolecular motion of AIEgens, which also show negligible generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. In&#8197;vivo studies with a peritoneal carcinomatosis&#8208;bearing mouse model indicate that such supramolecular AIE dots have rather low in&#8197;vivo side toxicity and can serve as a superior fluorescent bioprobe for ultrasensitive fluorescence image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.

      <title>5,6,12,13&#8208;Tetraazaperopyrenes as Unique Photonic and Mechanochromic Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>
Regioselective N&#8208;doping of peropyrenes for fluorescent tailored microcrystals was achieved. 5,6,12,13&#8208;Tetraazaperopyrene derivatives were synthesized, the crystals of which showed excellent optical waveguide properties and exceptional mechanochromic fluorescence.







Abstract
5,6,12,13&#8208;Tetraazaperopyrenes with different number of tert&#8208;butyl groups (c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;T, c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;H) were synthesized, via four&#8208;fold Bischler&#8211;Napieralski cyclization as the key step. As deduced from the single&#8208;crystal structures and optical properties, N&#8208;doping and substitution type allow for a precise control of intermolecular interactions. Compared to the reported 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraazaperopyrenes, significantly different packing modes were found in 5,6,12,13&#8208;tetraazaperopyrenes. Going from c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;T to c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;H, two additional tert&#8208;butyl groups lead to different preferential growth directions, affording 1D and 2D microcrystals, respectively. Most importantly, both microcrystals exhibit excellent optical waveguide properties with extraordinarily low loss coefficients and unique polarization features. Although c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;H possesses a rigid and planar core, its crystals display an exceptional mechanochromic fluorescence, which, again, depends on the mode of molecular packing.

      <title>Crystal Engineering of Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Organic Solids</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid state packing in a series of azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) derivatives controls their luminescence properties. Co&#8208;alignment of transition dipoles in&#960;&#8208;stacks leads to efficient room temperature phosphorescence while their 60&#176; rotation caused by sterically hindering tert&#8208;butyl groups results in an almost pure fluorescence. A phosphorescence quantum yield of 42&#8201;% is achieved for pure HTANGO crystals without heavy atoms.







Abstract
We report a series of highly emissive azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) solids in which the luminescent properties are controlled by engineering the molecular packing by adjusting the steric size of substituents. The co&#8208;alignment of &#8220;phosphorogenic&#8221; carbonyl groups within the &#960;&#8208;stacks results in an almost pure triplet emission in HTANGO, TCTANGO, TBTANGO and TITANGO, while their rotation by &#8776;60&#176; in the sterically hindered tBuTANGO leads to an almost pure singlet emission.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solid state packing &lt;/b&gt; in a series of azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) derivatives controls their luminescence properties. Co&#8208;alignment of transition dipoles in&#960;&#8208;stacks leads to efficient room temperature phosphorescence while their 60&#176; rotation caused by sterically hindering &lt;i&gt;tert &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl groups results in an almost pure fluorescence. A phosphorescence quantum yield of 42&#8201;% is achieved for pure HTANGO crystals without heavy atoms.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a series of highly emissive azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) solids in which the luminescent properties are controlled by engineering the molecular packing by adjusting the steric size of substituents. The co&#8208;alignment of &#8220;phosphorogenic&#8221; carbonyl groups within the &#960;&#8208;stacks results in an almost pure triplet emission in HTANGO, TCTANGO, TBTANGO and TITANGO, while their rotation by &#8776;60&#176; in the sterically hindered &lt;i&gt;t &lt;/i&gt;BuTANGO leads to an almost pure singlet emission. Despite strong &#960;&#8208;interactions, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation are avoided in HTANGO and TCTANGO which display efficient phosphorescence in the solid state.

      <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Long&#8208;Life Luminescent Polymeric Systems under Ambient Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Lucky blue&#8208;red clovers: A strategy for achieving excitation&#8208;dependent long&#8208;life luminescent polymer systems under ambient conditions by tuning the aggregation state of phosphors in polyvinyl alcohol films is developed. The developed polymers show promise in multicolor patterning for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Organic room temperature luminescent materials present a unique phosphorescence emission with a long lifetime. However, many of these materials only emit single blue or green color in spite of external stimulation, and their color tunability is limited. Herein, we report a rational design to extend the emission color range from blue to red by controlling the doping of simple pyrene derivatives into a robust polymer matrix. The integration of these pyrene molecules into the polymer films enhances the intersystem crossing pathway, decreases the first triplet level of the system, and ensures the films show a sensitive response to excitation energy, finally yielding excitation&#8208;dependent long&#8208;life luminescent polymeric systems under ambient conditions. These materials were used to construct anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns with multicolor interconversion, presenting a promising application potential in the field of information security.

      <title>In Vitro Light&#8208;Up Visualization of a Subunit&#8208;Specific Enzyme by an AIE Probe via Restriction of Single Molecular Motion</title>
      <dc:description>
The fluorescent probe TPEMA with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is presented. It is used for in&#8197;vitro specific discrimination of the B subunit of cytosolic creatine kinase isoenzyme in live cells by restriction of single molecular motion.







Abstract
Enzymes contain several subunits to maintain different biological functions. However, it remains a great challenge for specific discrimination of one subunit over another. Toward this end, the fluorescent probe TPEMA is now presented for highly specific detection of the B subunit of cytosolic creatine (CK) kinase isoenzyme (CK&#8208;B). Owing to its aggregation&#8208;induced emission property, TPEMA shows highly boosted emission toward CK&#8208;B with a fast response time and very low interference from other analytes, including the M subunit of CK (CK&#8208;M). With the aid of a Job plot assay, ITC assay and molecular dynamics simulation, it was directly confirmed that the remarkably enhanced fluorescence of TPEMA in the presence of CK&#8208;B results from the restriction of single molecular motion in the cavity. Selective wash&#8208;free fluorescence imaging of CK&#8208;B in macrophages under different treatments was successfully demonstrated.

      <title>An AIE&#8208;Based Probe for Rapid and Ultrasensitive Imaging of Plasma Membranes in Biosystems</title>
      <dc:description>
Insane in the membrane: A plasma membrane (PM)&#8208;specific probe with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics for wash&#8208;free PM imaging is presented. This is the first time that erythrocytes have been visualized in the brain through a fluorescence&#8208;based method. Moreover, a partial view of the eyeball structure of live zebrafish was obtained through the in&#8197;situ labelling of the epidermal PM.







Abstract
The abnormality of the plasma membrane (PM) is an important biomarker for cell status and many diseases. Hence, visualizing the PM, especially in complex systems, is an emerging field in the life sciences, especially in low&#8208;resource settings. Herein, we developed a water&#8208;soluble PM&#8208;specific probe utilizing electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction strategies with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as the signal output. The probe could image the PM with many advanced features (wash&#8208;free, ultrafast staining process, excellent PM specificity, and good biocompatibility), which were demonstrated by the PM imaging of neurons. The probe allowed for the first time the imaging of erythrocytes in the complex brain environment through a fluorescence&#8208;based method. Moreover, the PM of the epidermal and partial view of the eyeball structure of live zebrafish are also revealed.

      <title>Dual Enhancement of Gold Nanocluster Electrochemiluminescence: Electrocatalytic Excitation and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
Drying enabled the electrocatalytic excitation and aggregation&#8208;induced emission of ligand&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), allowing a record high solid&#8208;phase electrochemiluminescence (ECL) yield of 78&#8201;% and visual ECL. This work supports the in&#8208;depth design and study of ECL in AuNCs and other materials in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as a new class of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophores for their interesting catalytic and emission properties, although their quantum yield (&#934;ECL) in aqueous medium is low with a poor mechanistic understanding of the ECL process. Now it is shown that drying AuNCs on electrodes enabled both enhanced electrochemical excitation by an electrocatalytic effect, and enhanced emission by aggregation&#8208;induced ECL (AIECL) for 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymine (ATT) protected AuNCs with triethylamine (TEA) as a coreactant. The dried ATT&#8208;AuNCs/TEA system resulted in highly stable visual ECL with a &#934;ECL of 78&#8201;%, and a similar enhancement was also achieved with methionine&#8208;capped AuNCs. The drying enabled dual&#8208;enhancement mechanism has solved a challenging mechanistic problem for AuNC ECL probes, and can guide further rational design of ECL emitters.

      <title>Two&#8208;Step Oxidation Synthesis of Sulfur with a Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
Red&#8208;emissive sulfur was synthesized through a two&#8208;step oxidation strategy using elemental sulfur and Na2S as starting materials. It possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies providing additional energy states in the red spectral region.







Abstract
Sulfur is not normally considered a light&#8208;emitting material, even though there have been reports of a dim luminescence of this compound in the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green spectral region. Now, it is shown how to make red&#8208;emissive sulfur by a two&#8208;step oxidation approach using elemental sulfur and Na2S as starting materials, with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 7.2&#8201;%. Polysulfide is formed first and is partially transformed into Na2S2O3 in the first step, and then turns back to elemental S in the second step. The elevated temperature and relatively oxygen&#8208;deficient environment during the second step transforms Na2S2O3 into Na2SO3 incorporated with oxygen vacancies, thus resulting in the formation of a solid&#8208;state powder consisting of elemental S embedded in Na2SO3. It shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, attributed to the influence of oxygen vacancies on the emission dynamics of sulfur by providing additional lower energy states that facilitate the radiative relaxation of excitons.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red&#8208;emissive sulfur &lt;/b&gt; was synthesized through a two&#8208;step oxidation strategy using elemental sulfur and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as starting materials. It possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies providing additional energy states in the red spectral region.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur is not normally considered a light&#8208;emitting material, even though there have been reports of a dim luminescence of this compound in the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green spectral region. Now, it is shown how to make red&#8208;emissive sulfur by a two&#8208;step oxidation approach using elemental sulfur and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as starting materials, with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 7.2&#8201;%. Polysulfide is formed first and is partially transformed into Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the first step, and then turns back to elemental S in the second step. The elevated temperature and relatively oxygen&#8208;deficient environment during the second step transforms Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; incorporated with oxygen vacancies, thus resulting in the formation of a solid&#8208;state powder consisting of elemental S embedded in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, attributed to the influence of oxygen vacancies on the emission dynamics of sulfur by providing additional lower energy states that facilitate the radiative relaxation of excitons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trackable Supramolecular Fusion: Cage to Cage Transformation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Metalloassemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
A Pt in a cage: Inspired by natural systems, a trackable supramolecular platinum(II) cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is presented. It takes advantage of programmable metal coordination chemistry as well as unique photophysical properties of AIE&#8208;active metalloassemblies.







Abstract
Herein, the trackable supramolecular transformation of a two&#8208;component molecular cage to a three&#8208;component cage through supramolecular fusion with another two&#8208;component molecular square is described. The use of tetraphenylethene (TPE), a chromophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, as a component for the molecular cages enables facile fluorescence monitoring of the transformation process: while both cages exhibit fluorescence emission via the restriction of intramolecular motion of the TPE motif, the interactions between TPE and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine introduced in the supramolecular fusion process result in partial fluorescence quenching and shifts in the emission maximum. This study provides a simple and efficient approach towards complex supramolecular cages with emergent functions and demonstrates that AIE features could provide unique opportunities for the characterization of complex, dynamic supramolecular transformation processes.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Gold Clustoluminogens for Enhanced Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;killing clusters: Aggregation&#8208;induced emission gold clustoluminogens (AIE&#8208;Au) for X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) were designed. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, AIE&#8208;Au strongly absorbed X&#8208;rays and efficiently generated hydroxyl radicals, which enhanced the radiotherapy effect. Additionally, AIE&#8208;AuX&#8208;ray&#8208;induced luminescence excited the conjugated photosensitizers, resulting in a PDT effect.







Abstract
The use of gold nanoparticles as radiosensitizers is an effective way to boost the killing efficacy of radiotherapy while drastically limiting the received dose and reducing the possible damage to normal tissues. Herein, we designed aggregation&#8208;induced emission gold clustoluminogens (AIE&#8208;Au) to achieve efficient low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) with negligible side effects. The aggregates of glutathione&#8208;protected gold clusters (GCs) assembled through a cationic polymer enhanced the X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence by 5.2&#8208;fold. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, AIE&#8208;Au strongly absorbed X&#8208;rays and efficiently generated hydroxyl radicals, which enhanced the radiotherapy effect. Additionally, X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced luminescence excited the conjugated photosensitizers, resulting in a PDT effect. The in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrated that AIE&#8208;Au effectively triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species with an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in the X&#8208;ray dose, enabling highly effective cancer treatment.

      <title>Molecular Design of Non&#8208;doped OLEDs Based on a Twisted Heptagonal Acceptor: A Delicate Balance between Rigidity and Rotatability</title>
      <dc:description>
Power of twist: A twisted heptagonal diimide acceptor with well&#8208;balanced structural rigidity and rotatability has been developed for the synthesis of a highly efficient aggregation&#8208;induced delayed fluorescence material, which was used to make state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs.







Abstract
The development of efficient non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is highly desired but very challenging because of a severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Herein, we present a heptagonal diimide acceptor (BPI), which can restrict excessive intramolecular rotation and inhibit close intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking due to well&#8208;balanced rigidity and rotatability of heptagonal structure. The BPI&#8208;based luminogen (DMAC&#8208;BPI) shows significant aggregation&#8208;induced delayed florescence with an extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield (95.8&#8201;%) of the neat film, and the corresponding non&#8208;doped OLEDs exhibit outstanding electroluminescence performance with maximum external quantum efficiency as high as 24.7&#8201;% and remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off as low as 1.0&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for non&#8208;doped OLEDs. In addition, the synthetic route to DMAC&#8208;BPI is greatly streamlined and simplified through oxidative Ar&#8722;H/Ar&#8722;H homo&#8208;coupling reaction.

      <title>A Conjugated Polymeric Supramolecular Network with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement: An Efficient Light&#8208;Harvesting System with an Ultrahigh Antenna Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
You're the antenna: A conjugated polymeric supramolecular network with aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been developed as an excellent light&#8208;harvesting system with an unprecedented antenna effect (35.9 in solution and 90.4 in solid film). Moreover, the emission of this network could be tuned, reaching 96&#8201;% sRGB area.







Abstract
Superior artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (ALHSs) require exceptional capacity in harvesting light and transferring energy. In this work, we report a novel strategy to build ALHSs with an unprecedented antenna effect (35.9 in solution and 90.4 in solid film). The ALHSs made use of a conjugated polymeric supramolecular network (CPSN), a crosslinked network obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based conjugated polymeric host (CPH) and conjugated ditopic guests (Gs). The excellent performance of the CPSN could be attributed to the following factors: 1)&#8197;The &#8220;molecular wire effect&#8221; of the conjugated polymeric structure, 2)&#8197;aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AEE) moieties in the CPH backbone, and 3)&#8197;high capacity of donor&#8211;acceptor energy transfer, and 4)&#8197;crosslinked structures triggered by the host&#8211;guest binding between Gs and CPH. Moreover, the emission of the CPSN could be tuned by using different Gs or varying the host/guest ratio, thus reaching a 96&#8201;% sRGB area.

      <title>Synthesis of Tetraarylethene Luminogens by C&#8722;H Vinylation of Aromatic Compounds with Triazenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Glowing couple: A simple and versatile coupling method to make tetraarylethenes, which display active aggregation&#8208;induced emission, from aromatic compounds and vinyl triazenes is described. The novel C&#8722;H vinylation approach allows installation of the triarylethenyl group onto simple unactivated arenes, heteroarenes, supramolecular hosts, bioactive molecules, and polymers.







Abstract
Tetraarylethenes are obtained by acid&#8208;induced coupling of vinyl triazenes with aromatic compounds. This new C&#8722;H activation route for the synthesis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens is simple, fast, and versatile. It allows the direct grafting of triarylethenyl groups onto a variety of aromatic compounds, including heterocycles, supramolecular hosts, biologically relevant molecules, and commercial polymers.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Gels from Silver Nanoclusters with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Fluorescence&#8208;to&#8208;Phosphorescence Switching</title>
      <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;induced gelation of Ag nanoclusters with atomic precision has been achieved. The metal&#8211;organic gel exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission with fluorescence&#8208;to&#8208;phosphorescence switching and reversible changes upon heating&#8208;&#8208;cooling cycles.







Abstract
Luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as a new class of functional materials that have rich physicochemical properties and wide potential applications. In recent years, it has been found that some metal NCs undergo aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and an interesting fluorescence&#8208;to&#8208;phosphorescence (F&#8208;P) switching in solutions. However, insights of both the AIE and the F&#8208;P switching remain largely unknown. Now, gelation of water soluble, atomically precise Ag9 NCs is achieved by the addition of antisolvent. Self&#8208;assembly of Ag9 NCs into entangled fibers was confirmed, during which AIE was observed together with an F&#8208;P switching occurring within a narrow time scale. Structural evaluation indicates the fibers are highly ordered. The self&#8208;assembly of Ag9 NCs and their photoluminescent property are thermally reversible, making the metal&#8211;organic gels good candidates for luminescent ratiometric thermometers.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Water by Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
True colors: An assembly&#8208;induced emission strategy was utilized to endow a simple dye molecule with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and tunable photoluminescence in aqueous solution. The obtained supramolecular assembly structure has intriguing photophysical properties and enables the fabrication of multicolor hydrogels and cell imaging.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state materials with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions have found widespread applications in materials science, while liquid or solution&#8208;phase pure organic RTP emission systems has been rarely reported, because of the nonradiative decay and quenchers from the liquid medium. Reported here is the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited pure organic RTP in aqueous solution by using a supramolecular host&#8208;guest assembly strategy. The unique cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated quaternary stacking structure allows tunable photoluminescence and visible&#8208;light excitation, enabling the fabrication of multicolor hydrogels and cell imaging. The present assembly&#8208;induced emission approach, as a proof of concept, contributes to the construction of novel metal&#8208;free RTP systems with tunable photoluminescence in aqueous solution, providing broad opportunities for further applications in biological imaging, detection, optical sensors, and so forth.

      <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Materials for Printable and Writable Security Inks</title>
      <dc:description>Organic materials with long&#8208;lived, color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence are potentially used for optical recording, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bioimaging. Herein, we develop a series of novel host&#8208;guest organic phosphors allowing dynamic color tuning from the cyan (502 nm) to orange red (608 nm). Guest materials are employed to tune the phosphorescent color, while the host materials show a synergistic effect to the guest to activate the phosphorescence emission. These organic phosphors have an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 0.7 s and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 18.2%. Although color tunable inks have already been developed using visible dyes, solution&#8208;processed security inks that are temperature dependent and display time&#8208;resolved printed images are unprecedented. This strategy can provide a crucial step towards the next&#8208;generation of security technologies for information handling.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Panorama and Chirality Controlled Structure&#8208;Energy Relationship in a Chiral Carboxylic Acid Dimer</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality recognition in dimers of  tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid  (THFA), a biologically active carboxylic acid, was studied in a conformer&#8208;specific manner using rotational spectroscopy and theoretical approaches. The THFA monomer is known to have a strong preference for the  trans  &#8208; over the  cis  &#8208;COOH configuration.  Two drastically different scenarios are possible for the detectable THFA dimer: the kinetically controlled formation of a dimer bound by feeble interactions between two  trans  subunits or the thermodynamically controlled formation of a dimer with a double hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure between two  cis  subunits.  To identify the conformers responsible for the extremely dense, broadband rotational spectra, it was essential not only to locate several hundred homo/heterochiral (THFA)  2  minima but also to evaluate the energetic connectivities among the minima. In addition, a series of experiments with different carrier gases and nozzle temperatures were carried out to aid the understanding of the very unusual dimer conformational distribution. The study further reveals an interesting chirality dependent structure&#8208;energy ordering relationship. A method for enantiomeric excess (ee) determination of THFA is presented using a recently proposed chiral self&#8208;tag approach. Even with the complicated conformational cooling paths present, a normalization step in the ee analysis can remove intensity anomalies, suggesting that the method is effective in providing accurate ee values.</dc:description>

      <title>Irreversible amide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework for selective and ultrafast gold recovery</title>
      <dc:description>Design of stable adsorbents for selective gold recovery with large capacity and fast kinetics is of great challenge, but significant for economy and environment. Here, we show the design and preparation of an irreversible amide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) JNU&#8208;1 via a building block exchange strategy for efficient recovery of gold. JNU&#8208;1 was synthesized through the exchange of 4,4'&#8208;biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (BA) in mother COF TzBA consisting of 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (Tz) and BA with terephthaloyl chloride. The irreversible amide linked JNU&#8208;1 gave good stability, unprecedented fast kinetics, excellent selectivity and outstanding adsorption capacity for gold recovery. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy along with thermodynamic study and quantum mechanics calculation reveals that the excellent performance of JNU&#8208;1 for gold recovery results from the formation of hydrogen bonds C(N)&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl and coordinate interaction of O and Au. The rational design of irreversible bonds as both inherent linkage and functional groups in COFs is a promising way to prepare stable COFs for diverse applications.</dc:description>

Computational analysis suggested that the seemin&#173;gly antielectrostatic halogen bonds in these systems were formed via a combination of several factors. First, an attenuation of the interionic repulsion by the solvent facilitated close approach of the anions leading to their mutual polarization. This resulted in the appearance of positively charged areas (s&#8208;holes) on the surface of the iodine substituents in I  4  Q  &#8208;&#8226;  responsible for the attractive interaction. Finally, the solid&#8208;state associates were also stabilized by multicenter (4:4) halogen bonding between I  4  Q  &#8208;&#8226;  and iodide.</dc:description>

      <title>Reagents for Selective Fluoromethylation: A Challenge in Organofluorine Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Reagents that introduce the CH2F group into organic molecules operate via electrophilic, nucleophilic, or radical routes. New stable, easy to handle, and efficient reagents for fluoromethylation provide access to organic CH2F derivatives of academic interest and industrial importance. While CH2F transfer to heteroatoms is straightforward, carbon fluoromethylation still remains a challenge.







Abstract
The introduction of a monofluoromethyl moiety has undoubtedly become a very important area of research in recent years. Owing to the beneficial properties of organofluorine compounds, such as their metabolic stability, the incorporation of the CH2F group as a bioisosteric substitute for various functional groups is an attractive strategy for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the monofluoromethyl unit is also widely used in agrochemistry, in pharmaceutical chemistry, and in fine chemicals. The problems associated with climate change and the growing need for environmentally friendly industrial processes mean that alternatives to the frequently used CFC and HFBC fluoromethylating agents (CH2FCl and CH2FBr) are urgently needed and also required by the Montreal Protocol. This has recently prompted many researchers to develop alternative fluoromethylation agents. This Minireview summarizes both the classical and new generation of fluoromethylating agents. Reagents that act via electrophilic, nucleophilic, and radical pathways are discussed, in addition to their precursors.

      <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Manipulation Approach for Synthesis of Atomically Mixed Nanoalloys as Efficient Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The atoms went in one by one: Atomically mixed AuPt, AuPd, PtPd, AuPdPt nanoalloys are prepared by the solid solvent method via single&#8208;atom level manipulation. The supported nanoalloys/CeO2 with ultra&#8208;low noble metal content exhibit remarkable catalytic performance towards CO oxidation at room temperature and robust thermostability.







Abstract
Synthesis of well&#8208;defined atomically mixed alloy nanoparticles on desired substrates is an ultimate goal for their practical application. Herein we report a general approach for preparing atomically mixed AuPt, AuPd, PtPd, AuPtPd NAs(nanoalloys) through single&#8208;atom level manipulation. By utilizing the ubiquitous tendency of aggregation of single atoms into nanoparticles at elevated temperatures, we have synthesized nanoalloys on a solid solvent with CeO2 as a carrier and transition&#8208;metal single atoms as an intermediate state. The supported nanoalloys/CeO2 with ultra&#8208;low noble metal content (containing 0.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au and 0.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt) exhibit enhanced catalytic performance towards complete CO oxidation at room temperature and remarkable thermostability. This work provides a general strategy for facile and rapid synthesis of well&#8208;defined atomically mixed nanoalloys that can be applied for a range of emerging techniques.

      <title>Zinc&#8208;organic Battery with a Wide Operation&#8208;temperature Window from &#8208;70 to 150 &#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous zinc (Zn) battery has been considered as a promising candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their cycle stability is generally limited by the structure collapse of cathode materials and the dendrite formation coupled with undesired hydrogen evolution on Zn anode.

Furthermore, the organic cathode can store Zn2+ through reversible coordination reaction with fast kinetics. Therefore, this battery can be cycled for 20,000 times with negligible capacity fading. Surprisingly, this battery can even be operated in wide temperature range from &#8208;70 to 150 &#8451;, exhibiting the task&#8208;specific areas with huge temperature change.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of A Stable N&#8208;Hetero&#8208;Rh(I)&#8208;Metallacyclic Silanone</title>
      <dc:description>A novel N&#8208;hetero&#8208;Rh(I)&#8208;metallacyclic silanone has been synthesized. This silanone, showing an extremely large dimerization energy (&#916;G = +86.2 kcal/mol), displays considerable stability and persists in solution up to 60 &#176;C.

Furthermore, the metallacyclic silanone presents two reactive centers (Si=O and Rh), which can be involved depending upon the nature of reagents. Of particular interest, the reaction with H2 starts with the hydrogenation of Rh(I) centre leading to the corresponding Rh(III)&#8208;dihydride complex and it undergoes a cis/trans&#8208;isomerization via a particular mechanism, demonstrating that addition&#8208;elimination processes can also happen for silanones just like their carbon analogues!</dc:description>

      <title>Unexpected Acetylation of Endogenous Aliphatic Amines by Arylamine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase NAT2</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;Acetyltransferases play critical roles in the deactivation and clearance of xenobiotics, including clinical drugs. NAT2 has previously been classified as an arylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase that mainly converts aromatic amines, hydroxylamines and hydrazines. Here, we demonstrate that the human arylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase NAT2 also acetylates a series of aliphatic endogenous amines. Metabolomic analysis and chemical synthesis revealed significantly increased intracellular concentrations of mono&#8208; and diacetylated spermidine in human cell lines expressing the rapid compared to the slow acetylator NAT2 phenotype. The regioselective N  8  &#8208;acetylation of monoacetylated spermidine by NAT2 answers the long&#8208;standing question in polyamine metabolism of the source of diacetylspermidine. We also identified selective acetylation of structurally diverse alkylamine&#8208;containing commonly used drugs by NAT2. Such moieties are present in 21% of prescribed drugs in the US and acetylation by NAT2 may contribute to variations in patient responses. The results demonstrate a previously unknown functionality and potential regulatory role for NAT2 and we therefore suggest that this enzyme should be considered for re&#8208;classification.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterostructured Inter&#8208;Doped Ruthenium&#8208;Cobalt Oxide Hollow Nanosheet Arrays for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>The development of transition metal oxides (TMOs)&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts toward efficient overall water splitting through delicate control of composition and structure is a challenging task. Herein, we report rational design and controllable fabrication of unique heterostructured inter&#8208;doped ruthenium&#8208;cobalt oxide ((Ru&#8208;Co)O  x  ) hollow nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth. Benefiting from the desirable compositional and structural advantages of more exposed active sites, optimized electronic structure, and interfacial synergy effect, the (Ru&#8208;Co)O  x  nanoarrays exhibited outstanding performance as a bifunctional catalyst. Particularly, they showed a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 44.1 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8211;2  and a small Tafel slope of 23.5 mV dec  &#8211;1  , as well as an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 171.2 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  . As a result, a very low cell voltage of 1.488 V was needed at 10 mA cm  &#8211;2  for alkaline overall water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyesters by a Radical Pathway: Rationalization of the Cyclic Ketene Acetal Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening polymerization (rROP) of Cyclic Ketene Acetals (CKAs) combines the advantages of both ring&#8208;opening polymerization and radical polymerization thereby allowing the robust production of polyesters coupled with the mild polymerization conditions of a radical process. rROP was recently rejuvenated by the possibility to copolymerize CKAs with classic vinyl monomers leading to the insertion of cleavable functionality into a vinyl&#8208;based copolymer backbone and thus imparting (bio)degradability.

The competition between the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;retaining propagation routes is a major complication in the development of efficient CKA monomers, ultimately leading to the use of only four monomers that are known to completely ring&#8208;open under all experimental conditions.

      <title>S&#8208;modified oxygen vacancies in iron&#8208;cobalt oxide nanosheets: Enabling extremely high activity of oxygen evolution reaction for achieving industrial water splitting benchmark</title>
      <dc:description>Water electrolysis is a promising strategy for high&#8208;purity hydrogen production but restrained by the high electricity cost. Developing an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst with excellent activity and low price is indispensable for reducing water electrolysis cost. The modulation of electronic structure of catalysts can be an efficient strategy to boost their activities. Herein, the oxygen vacancies of defective iron&#8208;cobalt oxide (FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo) nanosheets are modified by the homogeneously distributed sulfur (S) atoms. S atoms can not only effectively stabilize oxygen vacancies (Vo), but also form the Co&#8208;S coordination with Co active site in the Vo, which can modulate the electronic structure of the active site, enabling FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S to exhibit much superior OER activity. Remarkably, FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S exhibits a mass activity of 2440.0 A g  &#8208;1  at the voltage of 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH, which is 25.4 times higher than that of RuO  2  (96.0 A g  &#8208;1  ). Meanwhile, its Tafel slope can as low as 21.0 mV dec  &#8208;1  , indicative of its excellent charge transfer rate. When FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S (anode catalyst) is paired with the defective CoP  3  /Ni  2  P (cathode catalyst) for overall water splitting, the current densities can be achieved as high as 249.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 406.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the cell voltage of 2.0 V and 2.3 V, respectively, which meet well the requirement of industrial water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Stringing the PDI Bow</title>
      <dc:description>This study explores a new mode of contortion in perylene diimides where the molecule is bent, like a bow along its long axis.

      <title>A Mixed&#8208;Valence {Fe13} Cluster Exhibiting Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer&#8208;Switched Spin Crossover</title>
      <dc:description>It is promising and challenging to manipulate the electronic structures and functions of materials utilizing both metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) to tune the valence and spin states of metal ions.

Moreover, MMCT occurs between Fe  III  and one of the Fe  II  sites after heat treatment, resulting in the generation of a new phase, {[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  II  (CN)  3  ][(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  8  [Fe  III  Fe  II  3  (trz&#8208;ph)  6  ]}&#8901;[Ph  3  PMe]  2  &#183;[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ] (  1a  ). Structural and magnetic studies reveal that MMCT can tune the two&#8208;step SCO behavior of  1  into one&#8208;step SCO behavior of  1a  . Our work demonstrates that the integration of MMCT and SCO can provide a new alternative for manipulating functional spin&#8208;transition materials with accessible multi&#8208;electronic states.</dc:description>

      <title>Compressing Double [7]Helicene by Successive Charging with Electrons</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a benzo&#8208;fused double [7]helicene (  1  ) with two alkali metals, K and Rb, provided access to three different reduced states of  1  . The doubly&#8208;reduced helicene  1  2&#8722;  has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a solvent&#8208;separated ion triplet with two potassium counterions.

As structural consequence of the stepwise reduction of  1  , the central axis of helicene becomes more compressed upon electron addition (1.42 &#197; in  1  4&#8211;  vs  . 2.09 &#197; in  1  ).

      <title>How to Make Nitroaromatics Glow: Next Generation Large, &#967;&#8212;Shaped, Centrosymmetric Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>This article describes a synthetic approach to a new structurally diverse family of &#960;&#8208;expanded diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs). These red&#8208;emissive dyes, based on a previously unknown skeleton, can be easily synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy involving the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrrole followed by N&#8208;arylation and subsequent intramolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation.
A careful selection of the aryl substituents on DPP gives access to a
&#960;&#8208;extended DPP derivative with intense fluorescence reaching 750 nm. The fact that NO2 groups do not engage in the excited states is responsible for the lack of fluorescence quenching when this functional group is present. Comprehensive spectroscopic assays combined with first principle calculations corroborated that both N&#8208;arylated and fused DPPs reach a locally excited (S1) state after excitation, followed by internal conversion to states with solvent and structural relaxation, before eventually undergoing intersystem crossing. Only the structurally relaxed state is fluorescent with lifetimes in the range of several nanoseconds and tens of picoseconds in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents, respectively. The aforementioned lifetimes correlate with fluorescence quantum yields, which range from 6% to 88% in non&#8208;polar solvents and from 0.4% and 3.2% in polar solvents. For the fully fused DPP a very inefficient (T1) population is responsible for fluorescence quantum yields as high as 88% in polar solvents, which is among the uppermost ever recorded for nitro&#8208;aromatics. These findings demonstrate the immense importance of the ability to design, build and fine&#8208;tune the structure of large, &#960;&#8208;expanded functional dyes so that the strong polarization of centrosymmetric structures is achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic Poisson&#8217;s Effect and Deformation&#8208;induced Fluorescence Change of Elastic 9,10&#8208;Dibromoanthrathene Single Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Elastic organic crystals have attracted considerable attention as next&#8208;generation flexible smart materials. However, the detailed information on both molecular packing change and macroscopic mechanical crystal deformations upon applied stress are still insufficient. Here we report that fluorescent single crystals of 9,10&#8208;dibromoanthracene are elastically bendable and stretchable, which allows a detailed investigation of the deformation behavior. We clearly observed a Poisson&#8217;s effect for the crystal, where the short axes (i.e., b and c&#8208;axes) of the crystal are contracted upon elongation along the long axis (i.e., a&#8208;axis). Moreover, we found that the Poisson&#8217;s ratios along the b&#8208;axis and c&#8208;axis are largely different (i.e., anisotropic Poisson&#8217;s effect). Theoretical molecular simulation suggests that the tilting motion of the anthracene may be responsible for the large deformation along the c&#8208;axis. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurement of the bent elastic crystals reveal that the PL spectra at the outer (elongated), central (neutral) and inner (contracted) sides are different from each other. Furthermore, we observe a reversible change in the PL spectra upon applying and releasing the elongation stress.</dc:description>

      <title>Ineffective OH&#8208;pinning of the flipping dynamics of a spherical guest within a tight&#8208;fitting tube</title>
      <dc:description>A supramolecular/synthetic method was devised to affix a sterically hindered substituent onto a fullerene guest encapsulated in a tubular host. A two&#8208;wheeled complex of (C  59  N)&#8211;(C  59  N) with a tubular host was oxidatively bisected to afford the C  59  N  +  &#160;cation captured in the tube. The C  59  N  +  &#160;cation in the tube was then trapped by ethanol or water, which led to an oxy substituent pinned on the guest. The guest motions within the tube were modulated by the pinned substituent, and up&#8208;and&#8208;down flipping motions were halted by an ethoxy substituent. A hydroxy substituent, however, was ineffective in halting the flipping motions despite the tight&#8208;fitting relationship between the tubular host and the spherical guest. Theoretical calculations of the dynamics revealed that the flipping motions were assisted by OH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds between the guest and the carbon&#8208;rich wall and that sliding motions of the OH group were also facilitated by deformations of the tube.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of new bowl&#8208;shaped  N  &#8208;hydroxyimide derivatives has been designed and used as selective organoradical catalysts. A number of these bowl&#8208;shaped  N  &#8208;hydroxyimide derivatives exhibit excellent site&#8208;selectivity in the amination of benzylic C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds in aromatic hydrocarbon substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Cation&#8208;Controlled Assembly of Polyoxotungstate&#8208;Based Coordination Networks</title>
      <dc:description>We use the Preyssler polyoxoanion, [NaP5W30O110  ]14&#8722;  ({P5W30}), as a platform for evaluating the role of non&#8208;bridging cations in the formation of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;bridged polyoxometalate coordination frameworks. Specifically, we show that the assembly architecture of Co2+&#8208;bridged&#160; frameworks is dependent on the identity and amount of alkali or alkaline earth cations present during crystallization. The inclusion of Li+  , Na+  , K+  , Mg2+  or Ca2+  in the framework synthesis is used to selectively synthesize five different Co  2+&#8208;bridged {P5W30} structures. We evaluate the role of the competition between K+  and Co2+  for binding to {P5W30} in dictating framework assembly. The role of ion&#8208;pairing on framework assembly structure and available void volume is discussed. Overall, these results provide insight into factors governing the ability to achieve controlled assembly of POM&#8208;based coordination networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable Photoelectrochemical Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroarenes with Aliphatic C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroarenes are structural motifs found in many bioactive compounds and functional materials. Dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds provides straightforward access to functionalized heteroarenes from readily available materials. Established methods employ stoichiometric chemical oxidants under conditions of heating or light irradiation. By merging electrochemistry and photochemistry, we have achieved efficient photoelectrochemical dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes and C(sp3)&#8211;H donors through H2  evolution, without the addition of metal catalysts or chemical oxidants. Mechanistically, the C(sp3)&#8211;H donor is converted to a nucleophilic C&#8208;radical through H&#8208;atom transfer with chlorine atom, which is produced by light irradiation of anodically generated Cl2  from Cl&#8722;. The C&#8208;radical then undergoes radical substitution to the heteroarene to afford alkylated heteroarene products.</dc:description>
