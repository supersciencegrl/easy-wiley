         <title>Simultaneous Enrichment and Profiling of Intact N&#8208;linked, O&#8208;GalNAc, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Glycopeptides</title>

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The systematic high&#8208;throughput investigation of the system AlCl3/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O led to the discovery of a series of porous salts from readily available starting materials in high yields. In situ crystallisation studies confirm the rapid formation of the highly crystalline compounds within minutes under mild conditions.







Abstract
The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, HSO4&#8722;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt;95&#8201;%, 215&#8197;g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 430&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140&#8197;nm and 1250&#8197;nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

         <title>Chemical Modification of a Bacterial Siderophore by a Competitor in Dual&#8208;Species Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed investigation of the inter&#8208;species chemical communication between the human pathogens P. aeruginosa and S. aureus revealed that S. aureus converts pyochelin, an important siderophore secreted by P. aeruginosa, to its less potent pyochelin methyl ester (PME). In addition, PME is sensed by P. aeruginosa and affects metabolite expression, indicating a potential role as signaling molecule for both species.







Abstract
Chemical communication between competing bacteria in multi&#8208;species environments often enables both species to adapt and survive, and perhaps even thrive. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are two bacterial pathogens found in natural biofilms, especially in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where recent studies showed that there is often cooperation between the two species, leading to increased disease severity and antibiotic resistance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooperation are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed co&#8208;cultured biofilms in various settings, and we applied untargeted mass spectrometry&#8208;based metabolomics analyses, combined with synthetic validation of candidate compounds. We unexpectedly discovered that S. aureus can convert pyochelin into pyochelin methyl ester, an analogue of pyochelin with reduced affinity for iron (III). This conversion allows S. aureus to coexist more readily with P. aeruginosa and unveils a mechanism underlying the formation of robust dual&#8208;species biofilms.

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Transfer Events in [Fe4Co4] Cubes via a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Approach: The Impact of Elastic Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cubes were prepared via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. The molecular origins of their distinct (incomplete vs. complete) metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) properties were identified as the presence and absence of the inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl and CH/&#960; interactions. These compete with the cluster&#8208;anion interactions, resulting in the underlying elastic frustration and stopping the complete spin transition in 1.







Abstract
The engineering of intermolecular interaction is challenging but critical for magnetically switchable molecules. Here, we prepared two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cube complexes via the alkynyl&#8208; and alcohol&#8208;functionalized trispyrazoyl capping ligands. The alkynyl&#8208;functionalized complex 1 exhibited a thermally&#8208;induced incomplete metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) behaviour at around 220&#8197;K, while the mixed alkynyl/alcohol&#8208;functionalized cube of 2 showed a complete and abrupt MMET behaviour at 232&#8197;K. Remarkably, both compounds showed a long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;induced metastable state up to 200&#8197;K. The crystallographic study demonstrated that the incomplete transition of 1 was likely due to the possible elastic frustration originating from the competition between the anion&#8208;propagated elastic interactions and inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl &amp; CH&#8208;alkynyl interactions, whereas the latter are eliminated in 2 as a result of the partial substitution by the alcohol&#8208;functionalized ligand. Additionally, the introduction of chemically distinguishable cobalt centers within the cube unit of 2 did not lead to a two&#8208;step but a one&#8208;step transition, possibly because of the strong ferroelastic intramolecular interaction through the cyanide bridges.

         <title>Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb&#8208;Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermoelectric properties of the EuCuSb&#8208;EuZn0.5Sb solid solution. Vacancies in the planar honeycomb lattice cause a decrease in sound velocity and a sharp increase in point defect scattering, which combine to yield an 80&#8201;% decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition changes from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.







Abstract
AMX compounds with the ZrBeSi structure tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50&#8201;% on the M&#8208;site in the planar MX&#8208;layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu1&#8722;xZn0.5xSb solid solution. The transition from a fully&#8208;occupied honeycomb layer (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn0.5Sb) leads to non&#8208;linear bond expansion in the honeycomb layer, increasing atomic displacement parameters on the M and Sb&#8208;sites, and significant lattice softening. This, combined with a rapid increase in point defect scattering, causes the lattice thermal conductivity to decrease from 3 to 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The effect of vacancies on the electronic properties is more nuanced; we see a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as we go from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.

         <title>Development of Tough Thermoplastic Elastomers by Leveraging Rigid&#8211;Flexible Supramolecular Segment Interplays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative strategy for toughening thermoplastic elastomers without toughness&#8211;strength trade&#8208;off limitations is developed by leveraging the interplays between rigid and flexible supramolecular segments, resulting in the toughest (toughness 1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3) thermoplastic elastomer thus far. This work presents a general design principle for toughening polymer materials by mismatched supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions facilitate the development of tough multifunctional thermoplastic elastomers. However, the fundamental principles that govern supramolecular toughening are barely understood, and the rational design to achieve the desired high toughness remains daunting. Herein, we report a simple and robust method for toughening thermoplastic elastomers by rationally tailoring hard&#8211;soft phase separation structures containing rigid and flexible supramolecular segments. The introduced functional segments with distinct structural rigidities provide mismatched supramolecular interactions to efficiently tune the energy dissipation and bear an external load. The optimal supramolecular elastomer containing aromatic amide and acylsemicarbazide moieties demonstrates a record toughness (1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), extraordinary crack tolerance (fracture energy 282.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), an ultrahigh true stress at break (2.3&#8197;GPa), good elasticity, healing ability, recyclability, and impact resistance. The toughening mechanism is validated by testing various elastomers, confirming the potential for designing and developing super&#8208;tough supramolecular materials with promising applications in aerospace and electronics.

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a *H&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction from CO2RR. The findings reveal that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 in Cu&#8208;based catalyst could accelerate water dissociation and tailor *H intermediate coverage, which favors hydrogenation of the *HCCOH to ethanol. This study directs a feasible avenue for mediating *H intermediate coverage and tailoring *H&#8208;involved reduction reaction pathways on an efficient and durable Cu&#8208;based oxide catalyst.







Abstract
The direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products offers a promising pathway for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. However, producing ethanol remains a challenge because of the competitive ethylene formation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we propose an active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction on a layered precursor&#8208;derived CuAl2O4/CuO catalyst. The catalyst delivered a Faradaic efficiency of 70&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products and 41&#8201;% for ethanol at current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibited a continuous 150&#8197;h durability in a flow cell. The intensive spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 could tailor *H intermediate coverage and the elevated *H coverage favors the hydrogenation of the *HCCOH intermediate, accounting for the increased yield of ethanol. This work directs a pathway for enhancing ethanol electroproduction from CO2 reduction by tailoring *H intermediate coverage.

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOFs Confining Zwitterionic Sulfamic Acid as Proton Source and Conducting Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic loading of dual&#8208;functioning zwitterionic sulfamic acid in MOFs leads to proton conductivity of the order of 10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This high conductivity is the result of higher loading of sulfamic acid, which can act as both a proton source due to its acidity and a conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability and zwitterion effect.







Abstract
A few metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which typically use strong acids as proton sources, display superprotonic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1); however, they are rare due to the instability of MOFs in highly acidic conditions. For the first time, we report superprotonic conductivity using a moderately acidic guest, zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA), which is encapsulated in MOF&#8208;808 and MIL&#8208;101. HSA acts not only as a proton source but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen bonding ability and zwitterion effect. A new sustained concentration gradient method results in higher HSA encapsulation compared to conventional methods, producing 10HSA@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(bSA)2 and 8HSA@MIL&#8208;101. These MOFs show impressive superprotonic conductivity of 2.47&#215;10&#8722;1 and 3.06&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively, at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity, and maintain stability for 7&#8197;days.

Activation of benzothiophenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at C3 as their S&#8208;oxides enables formal C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling with phenols to access C4 arylated benzothiophenes. Computational studies suggest the intermediacy of a &#960;&#8208;complex between the benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes, activated by oxidation to the corresponding S&#8208;oxides, undergo C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H&#8208;type coupling with phenols to give C4 arylation products. While an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C3 of the benzothiophene is important, the process operates without a directing group and a metal catalyst, thus rendering it compatible with sensitive functionalities&#8212;e.g. halides and formyl groups. Quantum chemical calculations suggest a formal stepwise mechanism involving heterolytic cleavage of an aryloxysulfur species to give a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation. Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron&#8208;rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal&#8208;free arylation process.

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Triangulene Cation: Stable and NIR Fluorescent Diradical Cation with Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated. It is highly stable even in solution under air and has a triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation.







Abstract
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated as the stable diradical with a triplet ground state that exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission. As was the case for a triangulene derivative we previously synthesized, the triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was experimentally confirmed by magnetic measurements. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative is highly stable even in solution under air and exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation. Breaking the alternancy symmetry of triplet alternant hydrocarbon diradicals by a nitrogen cation would therefore be an effective strategy to create stable diradicals possessing magnetic properties similar to the parent hydrocarbons but with different electrochemical and photophysical properties.

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial synapse where non&#8208;relevant biomolecules (urea, lactic acid (LA) and fructose (Fru)) cannot modulate its plasticity, while only relevant biomolecules (glucose) can selectively activate the device and induce long&#8208;term modulation and memory effect. The device works properly in blood serum and shows enhanced synaptic behaviors at high glucose concentrations, suggesting its potential application as artificial neurons in vivo.







Abstract
The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Alkoxide Powered Zincation of Fluoroarenes Employing Zinc Bis&#8208;Amide Zn(TMP)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the metalation potential of Zn(TMP)2 the addition of KOtBu enables the activation of its amide groups to promote the regioselective zincation of a range of fluoroarenes forming higher order potassium zincates. This methodology can even be extended to non&#8208;activated arenes toluene and benzene under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Reminiscent of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser superbase recipes, the addition of two molar equivalents of KOtBu to Zn(TMP)2 (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) transforms this mild zinc bis&#8208;amide base to a powerful metalating agent able to perform facile regioselective zincation of a wide range of sensitive fluoroarenes. Structural authentication of the intermediates post Zn&#8722;H exchange demonstrates activation of both TMP groups to form a range of higher order bis&#8208;aryl potassium zincates, isolable as solids and further functionalized in electrophilic interception reactions. Studies assessing the role of KOtBu reveal that the first equivalent undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Zn(TMP)2, enabling kinetic activation of the amide groups; whereas the second equivalent stabilizes the metalated intermediate preventing ligand redistribution. Showcasing its metalating power, this bimetallic KOtBu/Zn(TMP)2 partnership, can effect zincation of toluene and benzene at room temperature.

         <title>Covalently Linked Hexakis(m&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Macrocycles as Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing organic nanotubes with defined lengths was developed by designing and synthesizing macrocycles with a &#946;&#8208;alanine linker. Oligomeric hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) macrocycles with four macrocyclic units as molecular nanotubes can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;s.







Abstract
The construction of nanotubular structures with non&#8208;deformable inner pores is of both fundamental and practical significance. Herein we report a strategy for creating molecular nanotubes with defined lengths. Macrocyclic (MC) units based on shape&#8208;persistent hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (m&#8208;PE) macrocycle MC&#8208;1, which are known to stack into hydrogen&#8208;bonded tubular assemblies, are tethered by oligo(&#946;&#8208;alanine) linkers to give tubular stacks MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 that have two and four MC units, respectively. The covalently linked MC units in MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 undergo face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking through intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions that further results in the helical stacks of these compounds. Oligomer MC&#8208;4 can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;seconds, which is among the longest open durations for synthetic ion channels and indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the self&#8208;assembling channels can be drastically enhanced by reducing the number of molecular components involved. This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 suggest the likelihood of constructing the next&#8208;generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.

         <title>Dynamic Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Communication Mechanism in Poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s under External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix inversion of chiral poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylenes was induced by a dynamic axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism. It was produced by on/off supramolecular interactions between conformationally rigid chiral pendants and bulky molecules.







Abstract
Helix inversion in chiral dynamic helical polymers is usually achieved by conformational changes at the pendant groups induced through external stimuli. Herein, a different mechanism of helix inversion in poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented, based on the activation/deactivation of supramolecular interactions. We prepared poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s (PAEPAs) in which the pendant groups are conformationally locked chiral allenes. Therefore, their substituents are placed in specific spatial orientations. As a result, the screw sense of a PAEPA is fixed by the allenyl substituent with the optimal size/distance relationship to the backbone. This helical sense command can be surpassed by supramolecular interactions between another substituent on the allene and appropriate external stimuli, such as amines. So, a helix inversion occurs through a novel axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism, opening a new scenario for taming the helices of chiral dynamic helical polymers.

         <title>Customizable Supraparticles Constructed from Catechol&#8208;Terminated Molecular Building Blocks with Controllable Intermolecular Interactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically introducing multiple assembly strategies into the construction of customizable supraparticles based on catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks, conventional supraparticles were endowed with structural and functional customization. This strategy paves a way for building multiscale super&#8208;assembled materials with high degrees of structural complexity and functional diversity.







Abstract
Colloidal supraparticles integrated with multicomponent primary particles come with emerging or synergetic functionalities. However, achieving the functional customization of supraparticles remains a great challenge because of the limited options of building blocks with tailorability and functional extensibility. Herein, we developed a universal approach to construct customizable supraparticles with desired properties from molecular building blocks obtained by the covalent conjugation of catechol groups with a series of orthogonal functional groups. These catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks can assemble into primary particles driven by various intermolecular interactions (i.e. metal&#8208;organic coordination, host&#8211;guest, and hydrophobic interactions), and then further assemble into supraparticles governed by catechol&#8208;mediated interfacial interactions. Our strategy enables the formation of supraparticles with diverse functionalities, such as dual&#8208;pH responsiveness, light&#8208;controllable permeability, and non&#8208;invasive fluorescence labeling of living cells. The ease with which these supraparticles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metals and orthogonal functional groups used, should enable a variety of applications.

         <title>A Significant Two&#8208;Dimensional Structural Transformation in a Coordination Polymer that Changes Its Electronic and Protonic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D structural transformation with a significant change in the coordination environment within the 2D layer was achieved in a copper&#8208;based coordination polymer in water at room temperature. The transformation led to large changes in the physical properties of the coordination polymers, such as proton conductivity and magnetism.







Abstract
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D (2D: two&#8208;dimensional) structural transformation accompanying significant bond rearrangement and coordination environment change is demonstrated in a coordination polymer (CP) comprised of copper(II) ions and terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;) ligands for the first time. When immersed in water, a free&#8208;standing membrane of 2D Cu(BDC)(DMF) (Cu&#8208;1; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) transforms into 2D Cu(BDC)(H2O)2 (Cu&#8208;2) while maintaining its highly oriented layered structure. In the 2D sheet, paddlewheel&#8208;type CuII dimers coordinated with four bidentate BDC ligands in a square&#8208;planar array in Cu&#8208;1 were released to form uniform aqua&#8208;bridged CuII chains, which are cross&#8208;linked with each other by unidentate BDC ligands, in Cu&#8208;2. The present facile approach to implement the 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transformation accompanied by bond rearrangement, which is characteristic of CPs, leads to a marked increase in in&#8208;plane magnetic susceptibility and proton conductivity. In situ experiments in support of theoretical calculations unveiled the energy diagram that governs the unique structural transformation.

         <title>Optimizing Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction via Interfacial Electric Field Modulation: Elevating d&#8208;Band Center in WS2&#8208;WO3 for Enhanced Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 can enhance the adsorption of intermediates by elevating the d&#8208;band center of W, resulting in an accelerated electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) kinetics.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing green ammonia under ambient conditions. Tungsten (W) is one of the most effective ENRR catalysts. In this reaction, the protonation of intermediates is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Enhancing the adsorption of intermediates is crucial to increase the protonation of intermediates, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. Herein, we constructed a strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 to elevate the d&#8208;band center of W, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach led to a significantly improved ENRR performance. Specifically, WS2&#8208;WO3 exhibited a high NH3 yield of 62.38&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a promoted faraday efficiency (FE) of 24.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations showed that the strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 upshifted the d&#8208;band center of W towards the Fermi level, leading to enhanced adsorption of &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;NH intermediates on the catalyst surface. This resulted in a significantly promoted reaction rate of the RDS. Overall, our study offers new insights into the relationship between interfacial electric field and d&#8208;band center and provides a promising strategy to enhance the intermediates adsorption during the ENRR process.

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel architecture with FeP nanodots fully embedded in nitrogen doped carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) . Such a structure allows the stress transfer between FeP nanodots and self&#8208;adaptive carbon matrix in sodium storage, which overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), which outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report a novel architecture with FeP nanodots fully embedded in nitrogen doped carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) . Such a structure allows the stress transfer between FeP nanodots and self-adaptive carbon matrix in sodium storage, which overcomes the intrinsic chemo-mechanical degradation of metal phosphides during long-term cycling.

         <title>A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Activation of Environment&#8208;Sensitive Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers</title>

         <dc:description>
A concerted strategy involving enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly to target overexpressed alkaline phosphatases in cancer cells and bioorthogonal reactions for controllable extracellular and intracellular activation of RuII&#8208;based imaging probes and photosensitizers is presented. The emission enhancement, lifetime extension, and (photo)cytotoxicity of the resulting RuII supramolecular assemblies were explored extracellularly and intracellularly.







Abstract
In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal&#8208;based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment&#8208;sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Bound Formates are Main Reaction Intermediates during CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Cu/ZrO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different types of formates were observed at the surface of a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst during the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. A Cu&#8208;bound formate representing only about 7&#8201;% of formates exhibited a high reactivity and was the only formate that could account for the production of methanol. The two other surface formates were located on the ZrO2 surface and exhibited significantly lower decomposition rates.







Abstract
Cu/ZrO2 is a promising catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Reaction pathways involving formates or hydroxycarbonyls have been proposed. We show here that three different types of formates can be observed under reaction conditions at 220&#8201;&#176;C and 3&#8197;bar, one being located on metallic Cu and two others being bound to ZrO2. The surface concentrations of formates were determined through calibration curves and their reactivity measured during chemical transient experiments. The Cu&#8208;bound formate represented only about 7&#8201;% of surface formates, but exhibited a higher reactivity and was found to be the only formate that could account for all the production of methanol. Copper is thus not there only to activate H2, but also bears other crucial intermediates. This work reemphasizes that fully quantitative IR analyses and transient methods are required to unravel the role of surface species.

         <title>Supramolecularly Engineered Reporters with Superoxide Anion&#8208;Triggered Chemiluminescence for Early Diagnosis and Efficient Amelioration of Acute Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>

Supramolecularly engineered chemiluminescence reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate, chlorin e6 and superoxide dismutase, are reported. The PCCS reporters were applied for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury.







Abstract
We report the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; preparation of kidney injury molecule&#8208;1&#8208;targeting supramolecular chemiluminescence (CL) reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid (PLGA)&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), for early diagnosis and amelioration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this system, O2&#8901;&#8722;, a biomarker of AKI, triggers the oxidation of CPPO to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanedione and subsequent CL emission via CL resonance energy transfer to Ce6. The L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA stabilizes CPPO and Ce6 via noncovalent interactions, promoting long&#8208;lived CL (half&#8208;lives: &#8776;1000&#8197;s). Transcriptomics analysis shows that PCCS reporters reduce the inflammatory response through glutathione metabolism and inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The reporters are able to non&#8208;invasively detect AKI at least 12&#8197;h earlier than current assays, and their antioxidant properties allow simultaneous treatment of AKI.

         <title>Unlocking Migratory Insertion in Gold Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in the AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle has been reported. It represents important progress within the field of gold redox couple chemistry and in particular in the migratory insertion topic.







Abstract
Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into AuIII&#8208;carbon bonds in the AuI/AuIII redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate was constructed with the bifunctional electrocatalyst Zn/SnO2 nanodots, achieving high selectivities and excellent productivities at large current densities. The role of the Zn dopant was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and (quasi)&#8208;in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6&#8201;% and 92.2&#8201;% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60&#8197;h at a current density of &#8776;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.

         <title>Multistate Aggregation&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Properties of Enantiopure Disulfide&#8208;Mediated Bispyrene Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective double thiol&#8208;ene addition onto a bis enol ether macrocycle provides chiral disulfide bispyrene macrocycles able to exhibit excimer aggregation&#8208;induced emission predominantly. Upon increasing the water content, ECD and CPL monitoring evidence multistate chiroptical properties, rationalized by TDDFT calculations. Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films and AFM studies help decipher the organization of the luminophores at the interface of water.







Abstract
A chiral bispyrene macrocycle designed for exclusive intermolecular excimer fluorescence upon aggregation was synthesized by a double hydrothiolation of a bis&#8208;enol ether macrocycle followed by intramolecular oxidation of free thiols. Unusually high stereoselectivity was achieved for the thiol&#8208;ene additions under templated conditions and Et3B/O2 radical initiation. After enantiomer separation (chiral stationary phase HPLC), aqueous conditions provoked aggregation. Detailed structural evolution was afforded by ECD/CPL monitoring. Three regimes can be observed and characterized by strong modifications in chiroptical patterns under, at, or above a 70&#8201;% H2O&#8201;:&#8201;THF threshold. In luminescence, high glum dissymmetry factors values were obtained, up to 0.022, as well as a double sign inversion of CPL signals during the aggregation, a behavior rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Langmuir layers of enantiopure disulfide macrocycles were formed at the air&#8211;water interface and transferred onto solid substrates to afford Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films, which were then studied by AFM and UV/ECD/fluorescence/CPL.

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylated [Ge9] clusters form a novel type of chromophore system. Protonation of a covalently cluster&#8208;bound imine moiety results in an intense color change from red to green. Transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations on the protonated form reveal ultrafast dynamics upon photoexcitation leading to a charge&#8208;transfer between the cluster and the imine moiety, thus giving the proof of principle for a cluster&#8208;imine dyad.







Abstract
C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8722; (1&#8722;) is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS=trimethylsilyl; DAB(II)=1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8722; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;=669&#8197;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding can play a significant role in designing complex bioinspired structures. Here, two different types of this interaction were employed to construct single and double helices from planar benzotellurazole amides.







Abstract
As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzimidazoles Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a conceptually new, highly efficient radical route for the benzimidazole synthesis via radical&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols and o&#8208;arylenediamines concomitantly with hydrogen (H2) production over Pd modified ultrathin ZnO NSs (Pd/ZnO) under mild conditions.







Abstract
Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). The mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8208;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazole synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.

         <title>Chemically Gradient Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Crystal Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF on an in situ grown polymer film. The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network and showed improved proton conductivity compared to its polymeric analog.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are ordered supramolecular solid structures, however, nothing much explored as centimetre&#8208;scale self&#8208;standing films. The fabrication of such crystals comprising self&#8208;supported films is challenging due to the limited flexibility and interaction of the crystals, and therefore studies on two&#8208;dimensional macrostructures of HOFs are limited to external supports. Herein, we introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF film on an in situ&#8208;formed covalent organic polymer film (Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF). The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The kinetic&#8208;controlled Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF showed enhanced proton conductivity (8.3&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to its rapid kinetic analogue, Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;COP (2.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which signifies the advantage of bonding&#8208;engineering in the same system.

         <title>Solar Light Driven H2O2 Production and Selective Oxidations Using a Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst Prepared by a Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) prepared via the multicomponent Povarov reaction shows a high and long&#8208;term stable activity for photocatalytic H2O2 production and size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation. The COF can be further used as photocatalyst for a range of important aerobic oxidation reactions including the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes, amines to imines and sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
A chemically stable 2D microporous COF (PMCR&#8208;1) was synthesized via the multicomponent Povarov reaction. PMCR&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable and long&#8208;term stable photocatalytic H2O2 production rate (60&#8197;h) from pure and sea water under visible light. The H2O2 production is markedly enhanced when benzyl alcohol (BA) is added as reductant, which is also due to a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of BA with dangling phenyl moieties in the COF pores introduced by the multicomponent Povarov reaction. Motivated by the concomitant BA oxidation to benzaldehyde during H2O2 formation, the photocatalytic oxidation of various organic substrates such as benzyl amine and methyl sulfide derivatives was investigated. It is shown that the well&#8208;defined micropores of PMCR&#8208;1 enable size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spiro&#8208;type hole transport material (HTM) was developed by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system (DP). The new HTM features a stabilized HOMO level, a higher glass transition temperature, and improved morphology on the perovskite layer compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. When incorporated into an n&#8208;i&#8208;p device, the DP&#8208;based HTM achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area (0.06&#8197;cm2) devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules (designated area of 27.56&#8197;cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78&#8201;% on a designated area of 27.86&#8197;cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1&#8201;% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2560&#8197;hours and 87&#8201;% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600&#8197;hours.

         <title>The Influence of Regiochemistry on the Performance of Organic Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the influence of sidechain regiochemistry on a series of thiophene&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting polymers, the degree of conformational disorder is found to be a crucial indicator of performance. Maximising non&#8208;covalent planarising interactions and polaronic charge delocalisation during molecular design must consequently be carefully weighed against considerations around conformational restrictions.







Abstract
Thiophenes functionalised in the 3&#8208;position are ubiquitous building blocks for the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;Investigating the influence of sidechain regiochemistry on a series of thiophene-based mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymers, the degree of conformational disorder is found to be a crucial indicator of performance. Maximising non-covalent planarising interactions and polaronic charge delocalisation during molecular design must consequently be carefully weighed against considerations around conformational restrictions.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites Camouflaged with Hybrid Cell Membranes for Accurate Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid cell membranes (HMs) consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membranes and glioma cell membranes were prepared and coated onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles. The obtained HMGINPs inherited good blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier penetration and homologous glioma targeting ability from the two types of source cells, and exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy against early&#8208;stage glioma.







Abstract
Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early&#8208;stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non&#8208;targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles, the as&#8208;obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early&#8208;stage glioma.

         <title>Regulated Ion/Electron&#8208;Conducting Interphase Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ions Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) with ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase was prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. This novel structure suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition due to the fast ionic/electronic transport and high Young's modulus, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metallic Zinc (Zn) is considered as a remarkably promising anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, dendritic growth and severe side reactions destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and ultimately reduce the electrochemical performance. Here, an artificial protective layer (APL) with a regulated ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase is constructed on the Zn&#8208;metal anode to provide excellent interfacial stability in high&#8208;rate cycling. The superior ionic and moderate electronic conductivity of the APL derives from the co&#8208;embedding of MXene and Zn(CF3SO3)2 salts into the polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, which enables a synergistic effect of local current density reduction during plating and ion transport acceleration during stripping for Zn anode. Furthermore, the high Young's modulus of the protective layer and dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology during cycling suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (2.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and passivation. As a result, in symmetrical cell tests, the modified battery presents a stable life of over 2000 cycles at ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research presents a new insight into the formation and regulation of stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for the Zn&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Rashba Band Splitting and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Induced by Halogen Bonds in Hybrid Layered Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a new series of 2D perovskites featuring thickness&#8208;dependent hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions. The strength of non&#8208;covalent interaction has a direct impact on the structure symmetry and optoelectronic properties. Stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetry, whereas weaker halogen bonds give rise to non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, Rashba splitting, suppressed radiative recombination, and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an essential role in directing the self&#8208;assembly of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic crystals. In hybrid halide perovskites, hydrogen bonding has been the paramount non&#8208;covalent interaction. Here, we show another non&#8208;covalent interaction, namely, the halogen bond interaction, that directs a symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly in a new series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites (ICH2CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n is the layer thickness, n=1&#8211;4). Structural analysis shows that the halogen bond strength varies with the layer thickness. For the odd number (n=1, 3) layered perovskites, stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetric structures, whereas for the n=2 layered perovskites, weaker halogen bonds result in non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Transient reflection spectroscopy shows a suppressed radiative recombination rate (k2&#8776;0) and prolonged spin lifetime for n=2 structure, suggesting an enhanced Rashba band splitting effect. The structural asymmetry is further confirmed with a reversible bulk photovoltaic effect. Our work provides a new design strategy to enable hybrid perovskites with emerging properties and functionalities associated with structural asymmetry.

         <title>A General Autofluorescence Method to Characterize Polymerization Progress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potentially general autofluorescence method that does not rely on traditional fluorogenic functional groups enables real&#8208;time/in&#8208;line spectroscopic monitoring of polymerization progress. Fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) is developed and demonstrated. Changes in (auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching correlate linearly with polymer degree of cure.







Abstract
An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here&#8208;developed fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;stabilized formulations. Multiple&#8208;well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high&#8208;throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.

&lt;p&gt;An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium-catalyzed ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here-developed fluorescence &lt;i&gt;lifetime&lt;/i&gt; recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst-inhibitor-stabilized formulations. Multiple-well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high-throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Single&#8208;Atom Sites Enable Efficient Oxygen Activation for Switching Anodic/Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring axial coordination of Fe sites for charge redistribution realizes efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to generate specific active intermediates. Highly active hydroxyl radicals produced by axial N&#8208;involved systems enable direct cathodic electrochemiluminescence, while C&#8208;decorated catalysts preferentially form superoxide anion radicals and only present anodic luminescence.







Abstract
Exploring advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerators with superior oxygen reduction activity that generate rich reactive oxygen species (ROS) has attracted great attention in boosting luminol&#8208;O2 electrochemiluminescence (ECL). However, tuning accelerators for efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to switch anodic/cathodic ECL is very challenging. Herein, we report that enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with axial N/C coordination structures (FeN5, FeN4&#169; SACs) can generate specific ROS for cathodic/anodic ECL conversion. Mechanistic studies reveal that FeN5 sites prefer to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals and afford direct cathodic luminescence by promoting the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds through N&#8208;induced electron redistribution. In contrast, FeN4&#169; sites tend to produce superoxide radicals, resulting in inefficient anodic ECL. Benefiting from the enhanced cathodic ECL, FeN5 SAC&#8208;based immunosensor was constructed for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroatomic&#8208; and heptagons&#8208; doped multiple helicenes were successfully synthesized and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. They exhibit distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circular dichroism (CD) signals, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.

         <title>Design of the Ionic Organic Nonlinear Optical Material NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4] with Ultrawide Band Gap and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent organic flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit, through reasonable nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;favourable layered design, a deep&#8208;ultraviolet ionic organic nonlinear optical crystal, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], with an ultrawide band gap and moderate birefringence was successfully obtained.







Abstract
Ionic organic crystals containing organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units has become one of the hot spots as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although this type of ionic organic NLO crystals commonly have remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, they also suffer from overlarge birefringences and relatively small band gaps that be hardly beyond 6.2&#8197;eV. Herein, a flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit was theoretically revealed, showing great potential for designing NLO crystals with balanced optical properties. Accordingly, through the reasonable NLO&#8208;favourable layered design, a new ionic organic material, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], was successfully obtained. As expected, it achieves not only a large SHG effect (4&#215;KDP), but also a suitable birefringence (0.06@546&#8197;nm) and an ultrawide band gap (&gt;6.5&#8197;eV). This study provides a new flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO&#8208;active unit, contributing to design more ionic organic NLO materials with excellent balanced optical properties.

         <title>Imaging the Footprint of Nanoscale Electrochemical Reactions for Assessing Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a new optical microscopy technique to measure the synergistic effect of metal hydroxide coatings on the hydrogen evolution reaction at the individual particle level in neutral media. The technique involves using hydroxide halo formation as a footprint of the reaction, and can provide real&#8208;time operando quantification of catalytic activity.







Abstract
This work proposes a novel method for measuring the intrinsic activity of single metal&#8208;based nanoparticles towards water reduction in neutral media at industrially relevant current densities. Instead of using gas nanobubbles as proxy, the method uses optical microscopy to track the local footprint of the reaction through the precipitation of metal hydroxide, which is associated to the local pH increase during electrocatalysis. The results show the electrocatalytic activities of different types of metal nanoparticles and bifunctionnal core&#8208;shell nanostructures made of Ni and Pt, and demonstrate the importance of metal hydroxide nano&#8208;shells in enhancing electrocatalysis. This method should be generalizable to any electrocatalytic reaction involving pH changes such as nitrate or CO2 reduction.

         <title>Photochemically&#8208;Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable&#8208;State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat is achieved for simulated and amino acid&#8208;based direct air capture systems by regulating solution pHs via a photoinduced proton transfer of a reversible metastable&#8208;state photoacid, leading to energetically sustainable and economically feasible climate change mitigation solutions using solar energy.







Abstract
One of the grand challenges underlying current direct air capture (DAC) technologies relates to the intensive energy cost for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release, making the massive scale (GtCO2/year) deployment required to have a positive impact on climate change economically unfeasible. This challenge underscores the critical need to develop new DAC processes with substantially reduced regeneration energies. Here, we report a photochemically&#8208;driven approach for CO2 release by exploiting the unique properties of an indazole metastable&#8208;state photoacid (mPAH). Our measurements on simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems revealed the potential of mPAH to be used for CO2 release cycles by regulating pH changes and associated isomers driven by light. Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a &#8776;55&#8201;% and &#8776;68&#8201;% to &#8776;78&#8201;% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO2 was found for the simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of on&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.

         <title>Ex situ Generation of Thiazyl Trifluoride (NSF3) as a Gaseous SuFEx Hub
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic procedure for the efficient ex situ generation of thiazyl trifluoride gas (N&#8801;SF3) as a new Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Fluoride Exchange hub. In typical SuFEx fashion, this triple&#8208;bonded azasulfur(VI) fluoride reagent and its mono&#8208;substituted derivatives react highly effectively with various nucleophiles to deliver a library of unreported thiazynes.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry, an all&#8208;encompassing term for substitution events that replace fluoride at an electrophilic sulfur(VI), enables the rapid and flexible assembly of linkages around a SVI core. Although a myriad of nucleophiles and applications works very well with the SuFEx concept, the electrophile design has remained largely SO2&#8208;based. Here, we introduce S&#8801;N&#8208;based fluorosulfur(VI) reagents to the realm of SuFEx chemistry. Thiazyl trifluoride (NSF3) gas is shown to serve as an excellent parent compound and SuFEx hub to efficiently synthesize mono&#8208; and disubstituted fluorothiazynes in an ex situ generation workflow. Gaseous NSF3 was evolved from commercial reagents in a nearly quantitative fashion at ambient conditions. Moreover, the mono&#8208;substituted thiazynes could be extended further as SuFEx handles and be engaged in the synthesis of unsymmetrically disubstituted thiazynes. These results provide valuable insights into the versatility of these understudied sulfur functionalities paving the way for future applications.

         <title>Stochastic Simulation of Controlled Radical Polymerization Forming Dendritic Hyperbranched Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The results suggest that the observed dispersities (&#272;=1.5&#8211;2) originated from the distribution of branch numbers and that the branch structures are well controlled. Furthermore, the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one.







Abstract
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (&#272;s) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed &#272;s (=1.5&#8211;2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.

         <title>Evidence of a Uranium&#8208;Paddlewheel Node in a Catecholate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through solvothermal combination of uranyl and a redox&#8208;active linker, we reduced the U&#8722;O bonds and subsequently formed a metal&#8208;organic framework built from a uranium paddlewheel node. This paddlewheel node, where two uranium atoms are connected by four hexahydroxytriphenylene species and capped with water moieties, is unprecedented.







Abstract
The interactions between uranium and non&#8208;innocent organic species are an essential component of fundamental uranium redox chemistry. However, they have seldom been explored in the context of multidimensional, porous materials. Uranium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a new angle to study these interactions, as these self&#8208;assembled species stabilize uranium species through immobilization by organic linkers within a crystalline framework, while potentially providing a method for adjusting metal oxidation state through coordination of non&#8208;innocent linkers. We report the synthesis of the MOF NU&#8208;1700, assembled from U4+&#8208;paddlewheel nodes and catecholate&#8208;based linkers. We propose this highly unusual structure, which contains two U4+ ions in a paddlewheel built from four linkers&#8212;a first among uranium materials&#8212;as a result of extensive characterization via powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Phase Transition Engineering of Host Perovskite toward Optimal Exsolution&#8208;facilitated Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have implemented a set of strategies to precisely control the phase evolution of host perovskite without compromising exsolution. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an example, we demonstrated how regulating phase structure can enhance the activity and stability of exsolved perovskites, emphasizing the importance of phase evolution control in catalytic chemistry occurring on perovskites with exsolution.







Abstract
The in situ exsolution technique of nanoparticles has brought new opportunities for the utilization of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts in solid oxide cells. However, the lack of control over the structural evolution of host perovskites during the promotion of exsolution has restricted the architectural exploitation of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskites. In this study, we strategically broke the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between promoted exsolution and suppressed phase transition via B&#8208;site supplement, thus broadening the scope of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskite materials. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an illustrative case study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P&#8208;eNs) can be selectively enhanced by regulating the explicit phase of host perovskites, accentuating the critical role of the architectures of perovskite scaffold in catalytic reactions occurring on P&#8208;eNs. The concept demonstrated could potentially pave the way for designing the advanced exsolution&#8208;facilitated P&#8208;eNs materials and unveiling a wide range of catalytic chemistry taking place on P&#8208;eNs.

In this study, we strategically broke the long-standing trade-off phenomenon between promoted exsolution and suppressed phase transition via B-site supplement, thus broadening the scope of exsolution-facilitated perovskite materials. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an illustrative case study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P-eNs) can be selectively enhanced by regulating the explicit phase of host perovskites, accentuating the critical role of the architectures of perovskite scaffold in catalytic reactions occurring on P-eNs. The concept demonstrated could potentially pave the way for designing the advanced exsolution-facilitated P-eNs materials and unveiling a wide range of catalytic chemistry taking place on P-eNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent engineering of dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine&#8208;based fluorophores was demonstrated to access broadband triple fluorescent emissions from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm. Mechanistic studies revealed that the steric effect modulates the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface, enabling the molecule to undergo multistep transformation along the sequence of bent, planar, and twisted structures.







Abstract
We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt;500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, the introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Monosubstituted Sulfondiimines by Metal&#8208;free Iminations of Sulfilimium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an operationally simple and safe method for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines starting from stable sulfiliminium salts. This metal&#8208;free procedure employs a combination of iodine(III) reagents with iodine and 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), providing particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted sulfondiimines in up to 85&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, electrophilic nitrene cations are suggested as the reactive intermediates.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are marginalized entities among nitrogen&#8208;containing organosulfur compounds, despite offering promising properties for applications in various fields including medicinal and agrochemical. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid synthetic procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines that overcomes current limitations in their synthetic accessibility. Particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl substrates, which are commonly difficult to convert by existing methods, react well with a combination of iodine, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), and iminoiodinanes (PhINR) in acetonitrile (MeCN) to furnish the corresponding sulfondiimines in yields up to 85&#8201;% (25&#8197;examples). Valuable &#8220;free&#8221; NH&#8208;N&#8242;H&#8208;sulfondiimines can then be accessed by N&#8208;deprotection under mild reaction conditions. Several experimental observations suggest a mechanistic pathway diverging from the common radical&#8208;based iodine/iminoiodinane mechanism. Based on the experimental results in combination with data obtained by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis we propose a direct amination from PhINNs and a reaction path via a cationic iodonitrene.

         <title>A Radio&#8208;Pharmaceutical Fluorescent Probe for Synergistic Cancer Radiotherapy and Ratiometric Imaging of Tumor Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical imaging agent and radiosensitized pharmaceutical containing diselenide and metronidazole was developed to realize the radiosensitizing effect and report the ROS levels through ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This molecule exhibited synergetic radiosensitization and could monitor the radiotherapy response for both hypoxic tumors and orthotopic glioma.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective and widely applied cancer treatment strategy in clinic. However, it usually suffers from radioresistance of tumor cells and severs side effects of excessive radiation dose. Therefore, it is highly significant to improve radiotherapeutic performance and monitor real&#8208;time tumor response, achieving precise and safe RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive radio&#8208;pharmaceutical molecule containing chemical radiosensitizers of diselenide and nitroimidazole (BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN) is reported. BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN exhibits enhanced radiotherapeutic effect via a multifaceted mechanisms and self&#8208;monitoring ROS levels in tumors during RT. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the diselenide produces high levels of ROS, leading to enhanced DNA damage of cancer cell. Afterwards, the nitroimidazole in the molecule inhibits the damaged DNA repair, offering a synergetic radiosensitization effect of cancer. Moreover, the probe shows low and high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence ratios in the absence and presence of ROS, which is suitable for precise and quantitative monitoring of ROS during sensitized RT. The integrated system is successfully applied for radiosensitization and the early prediction of in vitro and in vivo RT efficacy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biscyclopropanes Using Alkynes as Dicarbene Equivalents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed double cyclopropanation of CF2H&#8208;substituted enyne with alkenes is reported. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed with excellent stereoselectivity in one step. The method was extended to the cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation. In these processes, the functional alkyne is used as a dicarbene equivalent and 3 new rings are formed.







Abstract
Chiral biscyclopropanes are an important skeleton in many bioactive molecules. However, there are few routes to synthesize these molecules with high stereoselectivity due to the nature of multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report the first example of Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of bicyclopropanes with alkynes as dicarbene equivalents. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed in excellent stereoselectivity. This protocol features high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol was also extended to the cascaded cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation with excellent stereoselectivities. In these processes, both sp&#8208;carbons of alkyne were converted into stereogenic sp3&#8208;carbons. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cooperative weak hydrogen bonds between the substrates and the dirhodium catalyst may play key roles in this reaction.

         <title>Tetrazole Linkages as Photoactivated Fuels for Light&#8208;Regulated Photothermal/Photocatalytic Propulsion of Versatile Polymer Nanoplatforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated versatile polymer nanoplatforms with asymmetric geometry enable on&#8208;demand integration of various functionalities via tetrazole linkages. In response to UV or visible light, tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels simultaneously perform photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the polymer nanoplatforms for powering the multimode synergistic propulsion, thus showing potential in bio&#8208;applications.







Abstract
Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light&#8208;regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole&#8208;containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on&#8208;demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Efficient Selective Oxidation of Aromatic Alkanes by Double Cobalt Active Sites over Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;rich Mesoporous Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4) was synthesized by a simple ligand&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly method. Benefitting from abundant oxygen vacancies and the mesoporous structure of mCo3O4, a unique catalytic path was presented with direct oxidation of aromatic alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of hydrocarbon to functional compounds remains a challenge. Herein, mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4&#8208;350) showed excellent catalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes, especially for oxidation of ethylbenzene with a conversion of 42&#8201;% and selectivity of 90&#8201;% for acetophenone at 120&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, mCo3O4 presented a unique catalytic path of direct oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones. Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo3O4 activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co3+(Oh)&#8594;Co2+(Oh). Co2+(Oh) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O2, which provide insufficient O2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo3O4, sharply contrasted to non&#8208;selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyethyleneimines from the Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the synthesis of polyethyleneimines is reported based on manganese catalysed coupling of ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine. This avoids the use of the highly toxic feedstock, namely aziridine, that is currently used for the production of this polymer.







Abstract
Polyethyleneimines find many applications in products such as detergents, adhesives, cosmetics, and for processes such as tissue culture, gene therapy, and CO2 capture. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for the production of the branched polyethyleneimines involves aziridine feedstock which is a highly toxic, volatile and mutagenic chemical and raises significant concern to human health and environment. We report here a novel method for the synthesis of branched polyethyleneimine derivative from ethylene glycol and ethylenediamine which are much safer, environmentally benign, commercially available and potentially renewable feedstock. The polymerisation reaction is catalysed by a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant metal, manganese and liberates H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Our mechanistic studies using a combination of DFT computation and experiment suggest that the reaction proceeds by the formation and subsequent hydrogenation of imine intermediates.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation and Hydroalkynylation of Alkenes Enabled by a Transient Directing Group: Catalyst Generality through Rigidification

         <dc:description>
Use of tert&#8208;leucine as a chiral transient directing group enables the enantioselective reductive&#8208;Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl benzaldehydes under palladium catalysis. The dual catalytic reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the &#948;&#8208;position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies reveal the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 29/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;mediated strategy paves a way for enhancing ethanol production from CO2&#160;electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202302096), Xu Xiang, Jing He and co&#8208;workers unveil that the increased *H coverage on a layered precursor&#8208;derived Cu&#8208;based catalyst favors hydrogenation of *HCCOH to *HCCHOH and prioritizes the ethanol pathway, enabling highly efficient and durable production of ethanol. Such a strategy could be of potential use in *H&#8208;involved reduction reactions.

Organic electrode materials could break the dependency of lithium&#8208;ion batteries on minerals that are scarce and mined in conflict zones. In their Communication (e202300892), Yanliang Liang, Judy&#8197;I. Wu, Ognjen&#8197;&#352;. Miljani&#263;, Yan Yao et&#8197;al. report a naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil macrocycle as a promising organic electrode candidate. Its eight redox&#8208;active groups bring about a high specific capacity of 279 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, while the low solubility&#8212;a consequence of the shape&#8208;persistent structure&#8212;results in stable cycling performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity, utilizing MOFs embedded with a moderately acidic guest&#8212;zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA)&#8212;was demonstrated by Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302376). HSA not only acted as a proton source, but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. The MOFs, which had been filled with high quantities of HSA using a sustained concentration gradient method, exhibited impressive superprotonic conductivity, in the order of 10&#8722;1 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, they maintained their stability for a period of 7 days.

         <title>A Crowning Achievement: The First Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy was designed and implemented by Wu and co&#8208;workers, enabling the first solution&#8208;phase synthesis of circumcoronene derivatives, and providing the first direct evidence to the structure of the debated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Circumcoronene is a highly symmetric polybenzenoid hydrocarbon that has fascinated organic chemists and materials scientists for decades. However, until recently, it had only been studied theoretically, because its synthesis in solution remained challenging. In a recent report, Wu and co&#8208;workers described the first successful solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of crystalline circumcoronene derivatives, validating the long&#8208;predicted Clar structure. Their synthetic approach enables preparation of new polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons with multiple K&#8208;regions, which are difficult to obtain, and expands our understanding of the chemistry of these systems.

         <title>Carbon Deposit Analysis in Catalyst Deactivation, Regeneration, and Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article discusses the role of carbon species deposited from various feedstock molecules or formed over time during a catalytic process, including ways to mitigate the effects of these carbon species by catalyst design, regeneration or rejuvenation. This is done for various industrially relevant systems, including the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. New tools for the direct observation of the 3D&#8208;distribution of carbon species within the catalyst pore network are also described.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suffer from deactivation by deposition or formation of carbon deposits. Carbon deposit formation is thermodynamically favored above 350&#8201;&#176;C, even in some hydrogen&#8208;rich environments. We discuss four basic mechanisms: a carbenium&#8208;ion based mechanism taking place on acid sites of zeolites or bifunctional catalysts, a metal&#8208;induced formation of soft coke (i.e., oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a radical&#8208;mediated mechanism in higher&#8208;temperature processes, and fast&#8208;growing carbon filament formation. Catalysts deactivate because carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re&#8208;used, others can be regenerated or have to be discarded. Catalyst and process design can mitigate the effects of deactivation. New analytical tools allow for the direct observation (in some cases even under in situ or operando conditions) of the 3D&#8208;distribution of coke&#8208;type species as a function of catalyst structure and lifetime.

         <title>Traffic Lights for Catalysis: Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular and Extended Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as flowers blooming in response to the sun attract bees to continue their natural life cycle, molecules which respond to external stimuli can be used to control catalytic cycles. Development of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular and extended catalytic platforms is a pathway for precise tuning of reaction yield, rate, or enantioselectivity that could pave the way for the next era of sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Sulfonium Salts as Acceptors in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes is a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radicals. Sulfonium salt acceptors promise to dramatically expand the range of radicals that can be generated and exploited using EDA chemistry; the use of readily installed &#8220;sulfonium tags&#8221; relaxes the electronic constraints typically imposed on the parent substrate by an EDA complexation approach.







Abstract
The photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexation, however, imposes electronic constraints on the donor and acceptor components and this can limit the range of radicals that can be generated using the approach. New EDA complexation strategies exploiting sulfonium salts allow radicals to be generated from native functionality. For example, aryl sulfonium salts, formed by the activation of arenes, can serve as the acceptor components in EDA complexes due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature. This &#8220;sulfonium tag&#8221; approach relaxes the electronic constraints on the parent substrate and dramatically expands the range of radicals that can be generated using EDA complexation. In this review, these new applications of sulfonium salts will be introduced and the areas of chemical space rendered accessible through this innovation will be highlighted.

         <title>Photocatalysis as an Effective Tool for Upcycling Polymers into Value&#8208;Added Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has recently evolved to a powerful tool to convert plastics directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. Researchers developed distinct light&#8208;driven depolymerization strategies for various polymers, ranging from hydroxylated (bio)polymers to real&#8208;life polystyrene. These methods operate under mild conditions, show high efficiency, and thus constitute a promising alternative to traditional recycling methods.







Abstract
Shaping a sustainable future is closely tied to the development of advanced plastic recycling technologies. As global recycling rates remain low, the lion's share of post&#8208;consumer plastics is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. This unbalanced plastic waste management not only poses severe environmental risks, but also entails an irrevocable loss of chemical resources that are embedded in synthetic polymers. To give plastic waste a new life, a series of photocatalytic methods has recently been reported that convert polymers directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. These approaches operate at ambient temperature, show high reactivity/selectivity, and provide alternative reaction pathways as compared to thermal depolymerizations. This Minireview highlights the scientific breakthroughs in upcycling polymers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis under environmentally benign conditions.

         <title>Controlled Genetic Encoding of Unnatural Amino Acids in a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the application of the genetic code expansion technique to achieve the site&#8208;specific modification of the sensing region of a nanopore. The rationally designed conformation of unnatural amino acid (UAA) residues provides a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of peptides and pore. The chemical environment of the sensing region facilitates the direct discrimination of the mixtures of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids.







Abstract
Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopores are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restrict the diversity of the nanopores in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site&#8208;specifically incorporate the unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopores. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine&#8208;based aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;tRNA pair for a high yield of pore&#8208;forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single&#8208;molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This rationally designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework for endowing nanopores with unique sensing properties that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzil Derivatives for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil octaketone is an excellent cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. It reversibly accepts eight electrons per molecule, has a specific capacity of 279&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and shows stable cycling performance with &#8776;65&#8201;% retention after 135&#8197;cycles. Its shape&#8208;persistent, symmetric structure rigidifies during an eight&#8208;electron reduction, ensuring that this macrocycle remains insoluble in various redox states.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials could revolutionize batteries because of their high energy densities, the use of Earth&#8208;abundant elements, and structural diversity which allows fine&#8208;tuning of electrochemical properties. However, small organic molecules and intermediates formed during their redox cycling in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have high solubility in organic electrolytes, leading to rapid decay of cycling performance. We report the use of three cyclotetrabenzil octaketone macrocycles as cathode materials for LIBs. The rigid and insoluble naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil reversibly accepts eight electrons in a two&#8208;step process with a specific capacity of 279&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance with &#8776;65&#8201;% capacity retention after 135&#8197;cycles. DFT calculations indicate that its reduction increases both ring strain and ring rigidity, as demonstrated by computed high distortion energies, repulsive regions in NCI plots, and close [C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C] contacts between the naphthalenes. This work highlights the importance of shape&#8208;persistency and ring strain in the design of redox&#8208;active macrocycles that maintain very low solubility in various redox states.

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>

Chalcogen powder is pre&#8208;melted and resolidified to give a stable chalcogen precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of transition metal dichalcogenides. The obtained monolayer tungsten disulfide is uniform and shows high optical and structural quality.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6&#177;1.9&#8197;meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9&#177;3)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2 and (10&#177;4)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.

         <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on SnS2: Main Product Switch from Hydrogen to Formate by Pulsed Potential Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing S&#8208;vacancies into SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of CO2RR but leads to exclusive H2 evolution under static potential electrolysis. Pulsed potential electrolysis results in in situ generation of partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x in the catalyst, which leads to a switch of the main product from hydrogen to formate during the CO2RR with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to H2.







Abstract
Tin disulfide (SnS2) is a promising candidate for electrosynthesis of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate while the low activity and selectivity remain a great challenge. Herein, we report the potentiostatic and pulsed potential CO2RR performance of SnS2 nanosheets (NSs) with tunable S&#8208;vacancy and exposure of Sn&#8208;atoms or S&#8208;atoms prepared controllably by calcination of SnS2 at different temperatures under the H2/Ar atmosphere. The catalytic activity of S&#8208;vacancy SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) is improved 1.8&#8197;times, but it exhibits an exclusive hydrogen evolution with about 100&#8201;% FE under all potentials investigated in the static conditions. The theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption of *H on the Vs&#8208;SnS2 surface is energetically more favorable than the carbonaceous intermediates, resulting in active site coverage that hinders the carbon intermediates from being adsorbed. Fortunately, the main product can be switched from hydrogen to formate by applying pulsed potential electrolysis benefiting from in situ formed partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to hydrogen. This work highlights not only the Vs&#8208;SnS2 NSs lead to exclusively H2 formation, but also provides insights into the systematic design of highly selective CO2 reduction catalysts reconstructed by pulsed potential electrolysis.

&lt;/sub&gt; in the catalyst, which leads to a switch of the main product from hydrogen to formate during the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S-vacancy to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin disulfide (SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a promising candidate for electrosynthesis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-formate while the low activity and selectivity remain a great challenge. Herein, we report the potentiostatic and pulsed potential CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance of SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (NSs) with tunable S-vacancy and exposure of Sn-atoms or S-atoms prepared controllably by calcination of SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at different temperatures under the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ar atmosphere. The catalytic activity of S-vacancy SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is improved 1.8&#8197;times, but it exhibits an exclusive hydrogen evolution with about 100&#8201;% FE under all potentials investigated in the static conditions. The theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption of *H on the V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface is energetically more favorable than the carbonaceous intermediates, resulting in active site coverage that hinders the carbon intermediates from being adsorbed. Fortunately, the main product can be switched from hydrogen to formate by applying pulsed potential electrolysis benefiting from in situ formed partially oxidized SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S-vacancy to hydrogen. This work highlights not only the V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs lead to exclusively H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation, but also provides insights into the systematic design of highly selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalysts reconstructed by pulsed potential electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chemoenzymatic Approach To Produce a Cyclic Analogue of the Analgesic Drug MVIIA (Ziconotide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method has been developed to prepare backbone cyclic analogues of the &#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA. The most potent cyclic analogue, cM&#8208;7, shows highly improved stability and maintains the activity of the native peptide.







Abstract
Ziconotide (&#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)&#8208;mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six&#8208; to nine&#8208;residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated iontronic nanotool was developed for the study of single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation. With the nanotool, an N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;modified deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) was used for profiling a representative m6&#8197;A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO), which also released a DNA sequence that could be programmed as an antisense strand against intracellular FTO&#8208;mRNA.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell studies; however, solutions to epigenetic questions remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within a nanopipette for profiling a representative m6A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cytotrienin A: Late&#8208;Stage Installation of C11 Side Chain onto the Macrolactam Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of cytotrienin A, an ansamycin antibiotic with apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity, is described. The strategic use of the redox properties of hydroquinone and the traceless Staudinger reaction enabled the late&#8208;stage installation of the C11 side chain, which plays a critical role in its biological activity, onto the macrolactam and opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of ansamycin antibiotics.







Abstract
Cytotrienin A, an ansamycin&#8208;class antibiotic, exhibits potent apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity and has attracted much attention as a lead compound for anticancer drugs. Herein, we report a new asymmetric synthetic route to cytotrienin A, employing an unexplored approach involving the late&#8208;stage installation of a C11 side chain onto the macrolactam core. In this strategy, we utilized the redox properties of hydroquinone and installed a side chain on the sterically hindered C11 hydroxy group by the traceless Staudinger reaction. This study also demonstrated that the boron&#8208;Wittig/iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling sequence was effective for the concise and selective construction of the (E,E,E)&#8208;conjugated triene moiety. The developed route opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of the side chains of these ansamycin antibiotics and the preparation of other synthetic analogs and chemical probes for further biological studies.

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical Biosynthesis of the Brexane&#8208;Type Bishomosesquiterpene Chlororaphen through Two Consecutive Methylation Steps in Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 and Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4</title>

         <dc:description>
In the biosynthetic pathway of the first natural brexane&#8208;type compound, chlororaphen, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is methylated and cyclized by a non&#8208;canonical FPP methyltransferase (FPP&#8208;MT), furnishing &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP). Methylation by the &#947;&#8208;PSPP&#8208;MT yields &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP), which is converted into the bishomosesquiterpene chlororaphen by the chlororaphen synthase (ChloS).







Abstract
A non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic pathway furnishing the first natural brexane&#8208;type bishomosesquiterpene (chlororaphen, C17H28) was elucidated in the &#947;&#8208;proteobacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6. A combination of genome mining, pathway cloning, in vitro enzyme assays, and NMR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;step pathway initiated by C10 methylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP, C15) along with cyclization and ring contraction to furnish monocyclic &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP, C16). Subsequent C&#8208;methylation of &#947;&#8208;PSPP by a second C&#8208;methyltransferase furnishes the monocyclic &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP, C17), serving as the substrate for the terpene synthase. The same biosynthetic pathway was characterized in the &#946;&#8208;proteobacterium Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4, demonstrating that non&#8208;canonical homosesquiterpene biosynthesis is more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously anticipated.

         <title>Radical Coupling Initiated by Organophosphine Addition to Ynoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining established two electron nucleophilic catalysis of organophosphines with photoredox organocatalysis has allowed the discovery of a mechanistically unusual Giese coupling reaction. In addition to addressing a limitation in traditional photoredox coupling with electron&#8208;poor alkynes these studies demonstrate the viability of reaction designs that merge traditional nucleophilic phosphines organocatalysis and photoredox events.







Abstract
Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.

         <title>Mucin&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Chain Polymer (MIP) Fibers as Potent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological mucus, here, we report multi gram&#8208;scale synthesis of dendronized polysulfates as mucin&#8208;inspired virus&#8208;binding polymer (MIPs). Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis reveals their single chain fiber morphology. These biocompatible synthesized fibers inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and inhibitory activities depend on the length of the fibers.







Abstract
Mucins are the key component of the defensive mucus barrier. They are extended fibers of very high molecular weight with diverse biological functions depending strongly on their specific structural parameters. Here, we present a mucin&#8208;inspired nanostructure, produced via a synthetic methodology to prepare methacrylate&#8208;based dendronized polysulfates (MIP&#8208;1) on a multi gram&#8208;scale with high molecular weight (MW=450&#8197;kDa) and thiol end&#8208;functionalized mucin&#8208;inspired polymer (MIP) via RAFT polymerization. Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis of MIP&#8208;1 confirmed a mucin&#8208;mimetic wormlike single&#8208;chain fiber structure (length=144&#177;59&#8197;nm) in aqueous solution. This biocompatible fiber showed promising activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its mutant strain, with a remarkable low half maximal (IC50) inhibitory concentration (IC50=10.0&#8197;nM). Additionally, we investigate the impact of fiber length on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 inhibition by testing other functional polymers (MIPs) of varying fiber lengths.

         <title>Disc&#8208;Like Silver Nanocluster Ag93 Built with Bicapped Hexagonal Prismatic Ag15 and Ino Decahedral Ag13 Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4) is prepared. It is a disc&#8208;shaped structure, its Ag69 kernel consists of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 wrapped by six Ino decahedral Ag13 units through edge&#8208;sharing. The central silver atom has an unprecedented high coordination number of 14. This is the first time that Ino decahedra act as building blocks to assemble a supercluster.







Abstract
The reduction of alkynyl&#8208;silver and phosphine&#8208;silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph2SiH2 led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc&#8208;shaped cluster has a Ag69 kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 unit wrapped by six Ino decahedra through edge&#8208;sharing. This is the first time that Ino decahedra are used as a building block to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for understanding metal cluster assembling mechanisms.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional LDH Film Templating for Controlled Preparation and Performance Enhancement of Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer facilitates controlled interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride and piperazine, which results in two membranes with good separation performances towards salts and dyes. Due to the low water transport resistance of the LDH layer and the thinner polyamide layer, the composite membrane has a larger flux, which is a breakthrough in the trade&#8208;off between permeance and selectivity.







Abstract
Tailored design of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes that can be used in a variety of applications such as water desalination, resource recovery, and sewage treatment is desirable. Herein, we describe the use of layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer to control the interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) for the preparation of polyamide (PA) membrane. The dense surface of LDH layer and its unique mass transfer behavior influence the diffusion of PIP, and the supporting role of the LDH layer allows the formation of ultrathin PA membranes. By only changing the concentration of PIP, a series of membranes with controllable thickness from 10 to 50&#8197;nm and tunable crosslinking&#8208;degree can be prepared. The membrane prepared with a higher concentration of PIP shows excellent performance for divalent salt retention with water permeance of 28&#8197;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1, high rejection of 95.1&#8201;% for MgCl2 and 97.1&#8201;% for Na2SO4. While the membrane obtained with a lower concentration of PIP can sieve dye molecules of different sizes with a flux of up to 70&#8201;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the controllable preparation of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes and provides new insights into how the intermediate layer affects the IP reaction and the final separation performance.

Although main group redox systems are attractive as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, achieving high cell voltages via extreme redox couples typically compromises their long&#8208;term stabilities. We show that phosphine oxide functionalization can render terthiophenes robust two&#8208;electron acceptors at very low potentials, thus opening fundamentally new parameter space in the search for stable main group redox systems with high cell voltages.







Abstract
Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8722; reductions at potentials below &#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc=ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2&#8201;e&#8722; galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2&#8201;e&#8722; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Analysis of the S&#8208;Glycosylation Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Lincosamide Antibiotics</title>

The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ergothioneine, 1, into secondary metabolites. The structure and function analysis of LmbT provided a structural basis for the SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with ergothioneine. These findings will lead to the mechanistic understanding of key enzyme reactions in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine&#8208;containing natural products such as lincomycin&#8197;A.







Abstract
The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT, involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin&#8197;A, is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic incorporation of rare amino acid L&#8208;ergothioneine (EGT) into secondary metabolites. Here, we show the structure and function analyses of LmbT. Our in vitro analysis of LmbT revealed that the enzyme shows promiscuous substrate specificity toward nitrogenous base moieties in the generation of unnatural nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)&#8208;D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;lincosamides. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of LmbT in its apo form and in complex with substrates indicated that the large conformational changes of the active site occur upon binding of the substrates, and that EGT is strictly recognized by salt&#8208;bridge and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with Arg260 and Trp101, respectively. The structure of LmbT in complex with its substrates, the docking model with the EGT&#8208;S&#8208;conjugated lincosamide, and the structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis analysis revealed the structural details of the LmbT&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with EGT.

         <title>Carrier Protein Mediated Formation of the Dihydropyridazinone Ring in Actinopyridazinone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinopyridazinone biosynthesis represents a unique biochemical transformation of an amino acid. It involves N&#947;&#8208;amination of DABA using alanine as a nitrogen donor. An acetyl hydrazone intermediate undergoes an unprecedented carrier protein mediated heterocyclization to give a dihydropyridazinone. This is a sophisticated biosynthetic strategy in which an acetylation temporarily protects the reactive hydrazone during biosynthesis.







Abstract
Heterocycles with nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bonds are privileged building blocks of synthetic drugs. They are also found in natural products, although the biosynthetic logic behind them is poorly understood. Actinopyridazinones produced by Streptomyces sp. MSD090630SC&#8208;05 possess unique dihydropyridazinone rings that have been studied as core nuclei in several approved synthetic therapeutics. Herein, we performed gene knockouts and in vitro biochemical experiments to elucidate the major steps in actinopyridazinone biosynthesis, including the unprecedented carrier protein mediated machinery for dihydropyridazinone formation.

         <title>Discrimination of the Enantiotopic Faces of Structurally Unbiased Carbenium Ions Employing a Cyclohexadiene&#8208;Based Chiral Hydride Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclohexadiene&#8208;based dihydrogen surrogate can distinguish between the enantiotopic faces of benzylic carbenium ions (see Scheme). No covalent interactions are required but instead dispersion controls the facial discrimination as verified by computations.







Abstract
An enantioselective reduction of simple carbenium ions with cyclohexadienes containing a hydridic C&#8722;H bond at an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is disclosed. The net reaction is a transfer hydrogenation of alkenes (styrenes) only employing chiral cyclohexadienes as dihydrogen surrogates. The trityl cation is used to initiate a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted process, in which a delicate intermolecular capture of a carbenium&#8208;ion intermediate by the aforementioned chiral hydride source is enantioselectivity determining. Exclusively non&#8208;covalent interactions are rendering one of the transition states energetically more favored, giving the reduction products in good enantiomeric ratios. The computed reaction mechanism supports the present findings as well as previous results obtained from studies on other transfer&#8208;hydrogenation methods involving the cyclohexadiene platform.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine 1&#8208;Imines via RuII/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Cyclization</title>

Enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization of sulfondiimines with sulfoxonium ylides using a RuII catalyst and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, thus expanding the accessible chemical space of chiral hexavalent organosulfur scaffolds relevant to biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a C20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid, was completed. The hexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton was strategically established by a photoinduced electron transfer, generating a cationic radical intermediate from a silyl enolate.







Abstract
We have accomplished the total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a polycyclic C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid featuring a 7,20&#8208;lactone&#8208;hemiketal bridge, through a radical cascade cyclization triggered by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of a silyl enolate to form the cyclohexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton. Other key points in our synthetic strategy encompass a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to construct the middle six&#8208;membered ring of sculponin&#8197;U, and an intramolecular radical cyclization induced by iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer to close the western cyclohexane ring. Successful preparation of the enantiopure silyl enolate as the PET precursor enables the asymmetric total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, opening a new avenue for divergent syntheses of structurally related C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane congeners and pharmaceutical derivatives thereof.

         <title>Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>

Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one&#8208;pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.







Abstract
Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease&#8208;relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one&#8208;pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with TiIV ions and a membrane&#8208;penetrating peptide, octa&#8208;arginine R8+, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on&#8208;bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to TiIV ion&#8208;only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra&#8208;sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We explored its clinical application of monitoring the outcome of chemotherapy of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with a small volume of CSF, presenting a powerful tool for broad clinical applications.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Free, Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Free and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Saturated Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a powerful complement to existing organic amine catalysis, direct activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of saturated cyclic ketones is realized for the first time in an amine&#8208;free and directing&#8208;group&#8208;free catalytic mode. The carbonyl group binds to a defect site of the quantum dot (QD) surface, selectively weakening the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, instead of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, and exclusively generating an &#945;&#8208;C radical under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This unique activation platform leads to selective activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic ketones under redox&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
The activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones typically requires an amine and a directing group to guide the reaction selectivity in amine&#8208;catalysis carbonyl chemistry. For an &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of ketone, directing groups are also required to control the reaction selectivity. Reported herein is the first &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones in the absence of an amine catalyst and directing group. 1H&#8197;NMR, XPS, EPR studies and DFT calculations indicate that an &#945;&#8208;carbon radical intermediate is formed through direct and selective activation of the inert &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones chelating on the surface of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Such an interaction is essential for weakening the C&#8722;H bond, as exemplified, using CdSe QDs as the sole photocatalyst to execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of cyclic ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Without an amine catalyst and directing group, the high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy transformation under redox&#8208;neutral condition opens a new way for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of ketones in carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Amplified Chirality Transfer to Aromatic Molecules through Non&#8208;specific Inclusion by Amorphous, Hyperbranched Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active, hyperbranched poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives have been shown to include aromatic small molecules in their interior space. These small molecules form liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;like intermolecular arrangements and exhibit clear circular dichroism and efficient circularly polarized luminescence with remarkably amplified anisotropy.







Abstract
Optically active, hyperbranched, poly(fluorene&#8208;2,4,7&#8208;triylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) [poly(fluorenevinylene)] derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the fluorene backbone at various ratios acted as a chirality donor (host polymers) efficiently included naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 9,10&#8208;diphenyanthracene as a chirality acceptor (guest molecules) in their interior space in film as well as in solution, with the guest molecules exhibiting intense circular dichroism through chirality transfer with chirality amplification. The efficiency of the chirality transfer was much higher with higher&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polymers than lower&#8208;molar&#8208;mass ones as well as with hyperbranched polymers compared to the analogous linear ones. The hyperbranched polymers include the small molecules in their complex structure without any specific interactions at various stoichiometries. The included molecules may have ordered intermolecular arrangement that may be somewhat similar to those of liquid crystals. Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene included in the polymer exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence, where the chirality was remarkably amplified in excited states, and anthracene exhibited especially high anisotropies in the emission on the order of 10&#8722;2.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Area Determination of Anisotropic Polymersomes by Amphiphilic Molecular Probe Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular probe loading method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method relies on the loading of an amphiphilic molecular probe onto the PEG corona of polymersomes as a monolayer. The surface area of anisotropic polymersomes is determined by the loading amount of probes.







Abstract
The surface area of anisotropic polymeric assemblies is a critical parameter concerning their properties. However, it is still a grand challenge for traditional techniques to determine the surface area. Here, a molecular probe loading (MPL) method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method uses an amphiphilic molecular probe, comprising hydrophobic pyrene as the anchor and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (EG4) as the float. The surface area of spherical polymersomes determined by dynamic light scattering is quantitatively correlated with the loading amount of probes, allowing the calculation of the average separation distance between the loaded probes. With the separation distance, we successfully determine the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes by measuring the loading amount. We envision that the MPL method will assist in the real&#8208;time surface area characterization, enabling the customization of functions.

This method uses an amphiphilic molecular probe, comprising hydrophobic pyrene as the anchor and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (EG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as the float. The surface area of spherical polymersomes determined by dynamic light scattering is quantitatively correlated with the loading amount of probes, allowing the calculation of the average separation distance between the loaded probes. With the separation distance, we successfully determine the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes by measuring the loading amount. We envision that the MPL method will assist in the real-time surface area characterization, enabling the customization of functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Structures of Intermediate Fragments during Stepwise Dissociation of Monolayer&#8208;Protected Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry, combined with theoretical calculations, is used to resolve the structures of intermediate fragments produced upon dissociation of atomically precise silver clusters in the gas&#8208;phase, which has remained challenging using other methodologies.







Abstract
Fragmentation dynamics of ligated coinage metal clusters reflects their structural and bonding properties. So far methodological challenges limited probing structures of the fragments. Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag29L12]3&#8722;, i.e. [Ag24L9]2&#8722;, [Ag19L6]&#8722; and [Ag5L3]&#8722; (L is 1,3&#8208;benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag5L3]&#8722; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag19L6]&#8722; also involves a new channel of Ag2 loss and Ag&#8722;S and C&#8722;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8&#8201;e&#8722; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples. These results are also of potential interest for future soft&#8208;landing deposition studies aimed at probing catalytic behavior of Ag clusters on supports.

         <title>Multi&#8208;stage Transformations of a Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Perturbing Crystals to Glass&#8208;Forming Liquids that Re&#8208;Crystallize at High Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
The first MOF glass composed of metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units is vitrified by multi&#8208;stage transformations: The crystalline MOF is amorphized by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration, goes through a glass transition to enter a super&#8208;cooled liquid state, and recrystallizes into the initial structure. These multi&#8208;stage transformations are a rare example of high&#8208;temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Glassy and liquid state metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging type of materials subjected to intense research for their rich physical and chemical properties. In this report, we obtained the first glassy MOF that involves metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units via multi&#8208;stage structural transformations. This MOF is composed of linear [Mn3(COO)6] node and flexible pyridyl&#8208;ethenylbenzoic linker. The crystalline MOF was first perturbed by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration to give an amorphous state, which can go through a glass transition at 505&#8197;K into a super&#8208;cooled liquid. The super&#8208;cooled liquid state is stable through a wide temperature range of 40&#8197;K and has the largest fragility index of 105, giving a broad processing window. Remarkably, the super&#8208;cooled liquid can not only be quenched into glass, but also recrystallize into the initial MOF when heated to a higher temperature above 558&#8197;K. The mechanism of the multi&#8208;stage structural transformations was studied by systematic characterizations of in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, calorimetry, rheological, spectroscopic and pair&#8208;distribution function analysis. These multi&#8208;stage transformations not only represent a rare example of high temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly, but also provide new MOF processing strategy through crystal&#8208;amorphous&#8208;liquid&#8208;crystal transformations.

         <title>Hybrid Improper Ferroelectricity in Columnar (NaY)MnMnTi4O12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In columnar order quadrupole perovskites A2A&#8242;A&#8242;&#8242;B4O12 hybrid improper ferroelectricity emerges through A&#8208;site cation ordering across anti&#8208;displaced structural columns. This novel form of polar order couples to an intrinsic proper ferroelectric instability associated with underbonded magnetic A&#8242; Mn2+ ions, giving rise to a biased, asymmetric switching response under applied electric field that coexists at low temperature with antiferromagnetism.







Abstract
We show that cation ordering on A site columns, oppositely displaced via coupling to B site octahedral tilts, results in a polar phase of the columnar perovskite (NaY)MnMnTi4O12. This scheme is similar to hybrid improper ferroelectricity found in layered perovskites, and can be considered a realisation of hybrid improper ferroelectricity in columnar perovskites. The cation ordering is controlled by annealing temperature and when present it also polarises the local dipoles associated with pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller active Mn2+ ions to establish an additional ferroelectric order out of an otherwise disordered dipolar glass. Below TN&#8776;12&#8197;K, Mn2+ spins order, making the columnar perovskites rare systems in which ordered electric and magnetic dipoles may reside on the same transition metal sublattice.

         <title>Assembling a Heterobimetallic Actinide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by a Reaction&#8208;Induced Preorganization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unique architecture of the largest&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thorium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), a second actinide, uranyl, with dintinct coordination behaviour was successfully assembled into the framework via a novel reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy to yield a rare single crystalline heterobimetallic actinide MOF.







Abstract
Periodically arranging coordination&#8208;distinct actinides into one crystalline architecture is intriguing but of great synthetic challenge. We report a rare example of a heterobimetallic actinide metal&#8211;organic framework (An&#8208;MOF) by a unique reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy. A thorium MOF (SCU&#8208;16) with the largest unit cell among all Th&#8208;MOFs was prepared as the precursor, then the uranyl was precisely embedded into the MOF precursor under oxidation condition. Single crystal of the resulting thorium&#8208;uranium MOF (SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U) shows that a uranyl&#8208;specific site was in situ induced by the formate&#8208;to&#8208;carbonate oxidation reaction. The heterobimetallic SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U exhibits multifunction catalysis properties derived from two distinct actinides. The strategy proposed here offers a new avenue to create mixed&#8208;actinide functional material with unique architecture and versatile functionality.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Our group is energized by research topics that merge materials chemistry with supramolecular chemistry. We are actively investigating the development of coordination chemistry for host&#8211;guest complexes and sensing, and investigating photonic materials prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline biopolymers&#8230; In our experience, nearly every good piece of new research involves serendipity.&#8221; Find out more about work in the MacLachlan group at the University of British Columbia.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the MacLachlan group at the University of British Columbia. They recently published an article on the uniform growth of a metal&#8211;organic framework, ZIF&#8208;8, on the surface of individual cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). After the ZIF&#8208;8/CNC fibers had been coated with a microporous organic polymer, the ZIF&#8208;8 was removed to leave a microporous polymer with CNCs encapsulated in a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle architecture. This material proved to be effective for CO2 fixation. &#8220;Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8 on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers&#8221;, K.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Communication Along a Scaffolded Nanoscale Array of Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relaying conformational change over several nanometers is central to the function of allosterically regulated proteins. Replicating this mechanism artificially would provide important communication tools, but requires nanometer&#8208;sized molecules that reversibly switch between defined shapes in response to signaling molecules. In this work, 1.8 nm long rigid rod oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)s are scaffolds for switchable multi&#8208;squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bond relays. Each relay can adopt either a parallel or an antiparallel orientation relative to the scaffold; the preferred orientation is dictated by a director group at one end. An amine director responded to proton signals, with acid&#8208;base cycles producing multiple reversible changes in relay orientation that were reported by a terminal NH, which is 1.8 nm distant. Moreover, a chemical fuel acted as a dissipative signal. As the fuel was consumed, the relay reverted to its original orientation, illustrating how information from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium molecular signals can be communicated to a distant site.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed from at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nano&#8208;scale materials with the highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11 years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence&#8208;based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process to nonexperts, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Evolution of Giant Polyoxometalate: From &#8220;Keplerate&#8221; to &#8220;Lantern&#8221; Type Mo132 for Improved Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new structural variant (L&#8208;Mo132) of the giant Keplerate type polyoxometalate Mo132 (K&#8208;Mo132) was synthesized. It which features lantern type structure and contains multiple terminal coordinated H2O molecules on the outer surface. Its catalytic activity for the phenol oxidation reaction is superior to that of K&#8208;Mo132.







Abstract
Structural variants of high&#8208;nuclearity clusters are extremely important for their modular assembly study and functional expansion, yet the synthesis of such giant structural variants remains a great challenge. Herein, we prepared a lantern&#8208;type giant polymolybdate cluster (L&#8208;Mo132) containing equal metal nuclearity with the famous Keplerate type Mo132 (K&#8208;Mo132). The skeleton of L&#8208;Mo132 features a rare truncated rhombic triacontrahedron, which is totally different with the truncated icosahedral K&#8208;Mo132. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to observe such structural variants in high&#8208;nuclearity cluster built up of more than 100 metal atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that L&#8208;Mo132 has good stability. More importantly, because the pentagonal [Mo6O27]n&#8722; building blocks in L&#8208;Mo132 are concave instead of convex in the outer face, it contains multiple terminal coordinated water molecules on its outer surface, which make it expose more active metal sites to display superior phenol oxidation performance, which is more higher than that of K&#8208;Mo132 coordinated in M=O bonds on the outer surface.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(diphenylacetylene)s by Molybdenum and Tungsten Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two improved methods for synthesis of poly(diphenylacetylene)s having functional groups have been developed. Molybdenum(V) catalysis with the MoCl5&#8208;PhSnnBu3 system provides linear poly(diphenylacetylene)s by migratory insertion polymerization while low&#8208;valent tungsten catalysis with the WCl4&#8208;Ph4Sn&#8208;PPh3 system provides cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by ring expansion polymerization.







Abstract
Improved methods for the synthesis of linear and cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by polymerization of the corresponding diphenylacetylenes using MoCl5&#8208; and WCl4&#8208;based catalytic systems have been developed. MoCl5 induces migratory insertion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of arylation reagents such as Ph4Sn and ArSnnBu3 to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular linear poly(diphenylacetyelene)s with high molecular weights (number&#8208;average molar mass (Mn)=30,000&#8211;3,200,000) in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). On the other hand, WCl4 induces ring expansion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of Ph4Sn or reducing reagents to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s with high molecular weights (Mn=20,000&#8211;250,000) in moderate to good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). Both catalytic systems are applicable to the polymerization of various diphenylacetylenes having polar functional groups such as esters that are not efficiently polymerized by conventional methods using WCl6&#8208;Ph4Sn and TaCl5&#8208;nBu4Sn systems.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition as Access to Antitumor&#8208;Active Spirocyclic Oxindoles from Alkynes and Isatin&#8208;Derived Ketimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protocol for the synthesis of spirooxindoles that possess excellent antiproliferative activity on human tumor cell lines through a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of alkynes with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines was achieved. Various functionalized and readily available alkynes reacted under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Due to its excellent bioactivity profile, which is increasingly utilized in pharmaceutical and synthetic chemistry, spirooxindole is an important core scaffold. We herein describe an efficient method for the construction of highly functionalized new spirooxindolocarbamates via a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of terminal alkynes or ynamides with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines. This protocol has a good functional group compatibility, uses readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, low catalyst loadings and no additives. It enables the transformation of various functionalized alkyne groups into cyclic carbamates. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved and DFT calculations verify the feasibility of the mechanistic proposal. Some of the target products exhibit good to excellent antiproliferative activity on human tumor cell lines. In addition, one of the most active compounds displayed a remarkable selectivity towards tumor cells over normal ones.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Amphiphilic Oligourethanes with a Cascade Self&#8208;Immolative Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete self&#8208;immolative oligourethanes bearing N&#8208;naphthylcarbamate or N&#8208;(3&#8208;fluorophenyl)carbamate backbones are modularly synthesized. These oligourethanes undergo both photo&#8208;triggered cascade degradation and selective cleavage of benzyl&#8208;O linkages under tandem MS conditions. They self&#8208;assemble into unique nanostructures such as flat nanosheets, nanofibers, and nanoribbons, and a morphological transition is achieved upon thermal annealing.







Abstract
Discrete polymers offer an excellent platform for comprehending the interplay between precise chain structures, distinctive self&#8208;assembly behavior, and functional applications, whereas the development of discrete polymers with self&#8208;immolative properties remains scarce. Here, we modularly synthesize a library of discrete self&#8208;immolative oligourethanes containing N&#8208;naphthylcarbamate or N&#8208;(3&#8208;fluorophenyl)carbamate repeating units via iterative stepwise growth. These oligourethanes undergo not only cascade 1,6&#8208;elimination depolymerizations via photo&#8208;mediated removal of o&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate triggers but also selective cleavage of benzyl&#8208;O linkages under MS/MS conditions even without UV light irradiation. In aqueous media, these discrete oligourethanes self&#8208;assemble into different morphologies such as flat nanosheets, nanofibers, and nanoribbons, depending on the chain lengths and backbone compositions, and further morphological transitions are observed upon thermal annealing.

         <title>Functional Characterization and Cyclization Mechanism of a Diterpene Synthase Catalyzing the Skeleton Formation of Cephalotane&#8208;Type Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephalotene synthase (CsCTS), a new diterpene synthase from Cephalotaxus sinensis responsible for forming the core skeleton of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids, was functionally identified. The cyclization cascade was studied in depth through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis guided by molecular docking revealed the critical amino acid residues for the unique carbocation&#8208;driven cascade cyclization mechanism.







Abstract
CsCTS, a new diterpene synthase from Cephalotaxus sinensis responsible for forming cephalotene, the core skeleton of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids with a highly rigid 6/6/5/7 tetracyclic ring system, was functionally characterized. The stepwise cyclization mechanism is proposed mainly based on structural investigation of its derailment products, and further demonstrated through isotopic labeling experiments and density functional theory calculations. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation combined with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed the critical amino acid residues for the unique carbocation&#8208;driven cascade cyclization mechanism of CsCTS. Altogether, this study reports the discovery of the diterpene synthase that catalyzes the first committed step of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid biosynthesis and delineates its cyclization mechanism, laying the foundation to decipher and artificially construct the complete biosynthetic pathway of this type diterpenoids.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Cathode by sp&#8208;Carbon Induced Conversion in Multi&#8208;Level Structure of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li&#8208;free CuS cathode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer confinement structure is constructed readily with graphdiyne. It integrates the advantages of graphdiyne and produces abundant sp&lt;C&#8208;&gt;C&lt;C&#8208;&gt;S&lt;C&#8208;&gt;Cu hybridization bonds. The new hybridization bond regulates the conversion reaction, and the 2D confinement of graphdiyne avoids structural collapse and shuttle effect. Such cathode delivers an energy density of 934&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a robust lifespan of 3000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;level architecture formed alternatively by the conformal graphdiyne (GDY) and CuS is well engineered for Li&#8208;free cathode. Such a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept architecture efficiently integrates the advantages of GDY and produces new functional heterojunctions (sp&#8722;C&#8722;S&#8722;Cu hybridization bond). The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer 2D confinement effect successfully avoids structural collapse, the selective transport inhibits the shuttling of active components, and the interfacial sp&#8722;C&#8722;S&#8722;Cu hybridization bond significantly regulates the phase conversion reaction. Such new sp&#8722;C&#8722;S&#8722;Cu hybridization of GDY greatly improves the reaction dynamics and reversibility, and the cathode delivers an energy density of 934&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and an unattenuated lifespan of 3000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. Our results indicate that the GDY&#8208;based interface strategy will greatly promote the efficient utilization of the conversion&#8208;type cathodes.

         <title>Photoactivated DNA Assembly and Disassembly for On&#8208;Demand Activation and Termination of cGAS&#8208;STING Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivated DNA assembly/disassembly strategy is developed to achieve spatiotemporally controlled regulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in living cells. The strategy capitalizes on the intrinsic preference of cGAS protein toward long double&#8208;stranded DNA and the programmability of DNA assembly, enabling on&#8208;demand activation and termination of cGAS&#8208;STING signaling.







Abstract
Despite significant progress in DNA self&#8208;assembly for interfacing with biology, spatiotemporally controlled regulation of biological process via in situ dynamic DNA assembly remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report an optically triggered DNA assembly and disassembly strategy that enables on&#8208;demand activation and termination of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. In the design, an activatable DNA hairpin is engineered with a photocleavable group at defined site to modulate its self&#8208;assembly activity. Light activation induces the configurational switching and consequent self&#8208;assembly of the DNA hairpins to form long linear double&#8208;stranded structures, allowing to stimulate cGAS protein to synthesize 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) for STING stimulation. Furthermore, by endowing the pre&#8208;assembled DNA scaffold with a built&#8208;in photolysis feature, we demonstrate that the cGAS&#8208;STING stimulation can be efficiently terminated through remote photo&#8208;triggering, providing for the first time a route to control the temporal &#8220;dose&#8221; on&#8208;demand for such a stimulation. We envision that this regulation strategy will benefit and inspire both fundamental research and therapeutic applications regarding the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Generation and Exciplex Stimulated Emission in Photobasic Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;containing carbon dots may abstract a proton from the neighbouring water molecules (the so&#8208;called photobasic effect) at the excited state, leading to the significant promotion of photocatalytic performance. Moreover, due to the four&#8208;level energy diagram, the protonated carbon dot shows a net optical gain at the excited state, leading to stimulated emission, revealing a unique competitive mechanism for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach to generating sustainable hydrogen. However, the transport of photoelectrons to the catalyst sites, usually within ps&#8208;to&#8208;ns timescales, is much faster than proton delivery (&#8764;&#956;s), which limits the activity. Therefore, the acceleration of abstraction of protons from water molecules towards the catalytic sites to keep up with the electron transfer rate can significantly promote hydrogen production. The photobasic effect that is the increase in proton affinity upon excitation offers means to achieve this objective. Herein, we design photobasic carbon dots and identify that internal pyridinic N sites are intrinsically photobasic. This is supported by steady&#8208;state and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements that demonstrate proton abstraction within a few picoseconds of excitation. Furthermore, we show that in water, they form a unique four&#8208;level lasing scheme with optical gain and stimulated emission. The latter competes with photocatalysis, revealing a rather unique mechanism for efficiency loss, such that the stimulated emission can act as a toggle for photocatalytic activity. This provides additional means of controlling the photocatalytic process and helps the rational design of photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Cells Operating at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first low&#8208;temperature potassium&#8208;ion full cells have been successfully fabricated by using hard carbon (HC) anodes with matched electrolyte, as well as compatible cathodes. The potassium storage in HC relies on defect adsorption, interlayer co&#8208;intercalation, and nanopore filling, endowing full cells with excellent electrochemical performances at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work represents a significant advancement in the field of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are promising for cryogenic energy storage. However, current researches on low&#8208;temperature PIBs are limited to half cells utilizing potassium metal as an anode, and realizing rechargeable full cells is challenged by lacking viable anode materials and compatible electrolytes. Herein, a hard carbon (HC)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature potassium&#8208;ion full cell is successfully fabricated for the first time. Experimental evidence and theoretical analysis revealed that potassium storage behaviors of HC anodes in the matched low&#8208;temperature electrolyte involve defect adsorption, interlayer co&#8208;intercalation, and nanopore filling. Notably, these unique potassiation processes exhibited low interfacial resistances and small reaction activation energies, enabling an excellent cycling performance of HC with a capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C (68&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity). Consequently, the HC&#8208;based full cells demonstrated impressive rechargeability and high energy density above 100&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, representing a significant advancement in the development of PIBs.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Anchored Covalent Organic Frameworks@Amino&#8208;Modified Ti3C2Tx MXene on Nylon 6 Film for High&#8208;Performance Deformable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design high&#8208;performance deformable supercapacitors (D&#8208;SCs) based on porous and active covalent organic frameworks@amino&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx deposited on decorated nylon 6 film. The hierarchical film electrode exhibits admirable accessible surface, faster electronic migration and rich faradic active sites. The resultant D&#8208;SCs deliver excellent energy density, deformable stability (bending, stretching and folding states) and practical applications.







Abstract
Designing deformable supercapacitors (D&#8208;SCs) that have robust skeleton and smoothly active channels for charges kinetic migration and faradic storage are highly crucial for wearable systems. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance D&#8208;SCs made of the covalent organic frameworks(COF)@amino&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx deposited on decorated nylon 6 (DPA) film (COF@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/DPA) via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication. The hierarchical COF@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/DPA exhibits admirable specific capacitance, rate performance and cycling stability in three&#8208;electrode system due to the superior H+ storage property and large interfacial charge transfer clarified by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state D&#8208;SCs deliver favourable energy density and practical energy&#8208;supply applications. Particularly, the solid&#8208;state D&#8208;SCs present high deformable stabilities, with regard to 80.7, 80.6 and 83.4&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 bending cycles, 2000 stretching cycles and 5000 folding cycles, separately.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbene Derived Propellers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet carbenes have emerged as attractive building blocks for functional materials. Herein we show that cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs)&#8212;a class of highly ambiphilic singlet carbenes&#8212;provide access to organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular emitters. These propeller&#8208;like luminophores exhibit through&#8208;space arene&#8208;arene &#960;&#8208;delocalization and rapid intramolecular inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC).







Abstract

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes: Hypervalent Iodine Meets High&#8208;Valent Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective trifluoromethylation of various substituted VBX reagents enables the synthesis of CF3&#8208;substituted alkenes. The reaction with high&#8208;valent copper can be performed upon thermal or light&#8208;mediated initiation giving access to trifluoromethylated alkenes with perfect retention of the double bond configuration. Easy upscaling, the visible light version, and product modifications further highlight the versatility of the method.







Abstract
The first trifluoromethylation of vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) is reported herein. The synthetic method is based on the use of bench&#8208;stable, high&#8208;valent copper(III) species, and the reaction can be initiated under thermal conditions and/or irradiation (365&#8197;nm) giving access to trifluoromethylated alkenes in a stereoselective fashion. Various VBX reagents derived from tyrosine, cysteine, small peptides, thiols and amides can be used as precursors. The obtained alkenes could be further functionalized by reduction or epoxidation of the trifluoromethylated double bond. Furthermore, the method could be applied in a large&#8208;scale batch/flow synthesis and could be conducted under visible light irradiation.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons featuring N&#8208;heterocycles, fused pentagons, and bulky solubilizing groups are prepared, showing the largest molecular length of 33.8&#8197;&#197;, a high electron affinity, and a good chemical stability.They are demonstrated to be an excellent material for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications, achieving the highest nonlinear extinction coefficient of 374&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, superior to the classical material C60 (153&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1).







Abstract
Two novel N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons (NNNR&#8208;1 and NNNR&#8208;2) featuring multiple fused N&#8208;heterocycles and bulky solubilizing groups were prepared via bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis. NNNR&#8208;2 achieves a total molecular length of 33.8&#8197;&#197;, which represents the longest soluble N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbon reported to date. The pentagon subunits and doping of N atoms in NNNR&#8208;1 and NNNR&#8208;2 have successfully regulated their electronic properties, achieving high electron affinity and good chemical stability enabled by the nonalternant conjugation and electronic effects. When applied a laser pulse of 532&#8197;nm, the 13&#8208;rings nanoribbon NNNR&#8208;2 shows outstanding nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, with the nonlinear extinction coefficient of 374&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, much higher than those of NNNR&#8208;1 (96&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1) and the well&#8208;known NLO material C60 (153&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1). Our findings indicate that the N&#8208;doping of nonalternant nanoribbons is an effective strategy to access another type of excellent material system for high&#8208;performance NLO applications, which can be extended to construct numerous heteroatom&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with fine&#8208;tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Crystalline Nanoparticles of Water&#8208;Soluble Covalent Basket Cages (CBCs) for Encapsulation of Anticancer Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent basket cages (CBCs) are, in size, similar to small proteins with a large inner space structured to hold four bioactive molecules. These tetrahedral polyvalent hosts assemble into crystalline nanoparticles capable of removing doxorubicin and irinotecan from water by inclusion complexation. Being biocompatible, CBCs hold promise for developing nanoantidotes for the rapid sequestration of toxicants from complex biological environments.







Abstract
We herein describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and biocompatibility of novel covalent basket cage CBC&#8208;11, composed of four molecular baskets linked to four trivalent aromatic amines through amide groups. The cage is tetrahedral in shape and similar in size to small proteins (Mw=8637&#8197;g/mol) with a spacious nonpolar interior for accommodating multiple guests. While 24&#8197;carboxylates at the outer surface of CBC&#8208;11 render it soluble in aqueous phosphate buffer (PBS) at pH=7.0, the amphiphilic nature prompts its assembly into nanoparticles (d=250&#8197;nm, DLS). Cryo&#8208;TEM examination of nanoparticles revealed their crystalline nature with wafer&#8208;like shapes and hexagonally arranged cages. Nanoparticulate CBC&#8208;11 traps anticancer drugs irinotecan and doxorubicin, with each cage binding up to four drug molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative manner. The inclusion complexation resulted in nanoparticles growing in size and precipitating. In media containing mammalian cells (HCT&#8197;116, human colon carcinoma), the IC50 value of CBC&#8208;11 was above 100&#8197;&#956;M. While this work presents the first example of a large covalent organic cage operating in water at the physiological pH and forming crystalline nanoparticles, it also demonstrates its biocompatibility and potential to act as a polyvalent binder of drugs for their sequestration or delivery.

         <title>Design Principles for Maximizing Hole Utilization of Semiconductor Quantum Wires toward Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking small&#8208;molecule sacrificial electron donors as models, we found that increasing the driving force monotonically enhances hole&#8208;transfer kinetics of semiconductor quantum wires in an Auger&#8208;assisted model, while it affects the electron transfer parabolically in a Marcus model. This suggests three design principles to maximize hole utilization to boost solar hydrogen production and photo&#8208;oxidation of small molecules in quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals.







Abstract
Maximizing hole&#8208;transfer kinetics&#8212;usually a rate&#8208;determining step in semiconductor&#8208;based artificial photosynthesis&#8212;is pivotal for simultaneously enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar hydrogen production and hole utilization. However, this remains elusive yet as efforts are largely focused on optimizing the electron&#8208;involved half&#8208;reactions only by empirically employing sacrificial electron donors (SEDs) to consume the wasted holes. Using high&#8208;quality ZnSe quantum wires as models, we show that how hole&#8208;transfer processes in different SEDs affect their photocatalytic performances. We found that larger driving forces of SEDs monotonically enhance hole&#8208;transfer rates and photocatalytic performances by almost three orders of magnitude, a result conforming well with the Auger&#8208;assisted hole&#8208;transfer model in quantum&#8208;confined systems. Intriguingly, further loading Pt cocatalyts can yield either an Auger&#8208;assisted model or a Marcus inverted region for electron transfer, depending on the competing hole&#8208;transfer kinetics in SEDs.

         <title>ATP Drives the Formation of a Catalytic Hydrazone through an Energy Ratchet Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accelerates hydrazone&#8208;bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide and shifts the equilibrium reaction towards the product. Removal of the ATP using an enzyme largely reverses this beneficial effect and results in the formation of a kinetically stable state enriched in hydrazone. In this state, the reaction mixture has a higher catalytic activity compared to the same mixture at thermodynamic equilibrium.







Abstract
An energy ratchet mechanism is exploited for the synthesis of a molecule. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrazone&#8208;bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide is accelerated and the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted towards the hydrazone. Enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP installs a kinetically stable state, at which hydrazone is present at a higher concentration compared to the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of the degradation products of ATP. It is shown that the kinetic state has an enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of an RNA&#8208;model compound.

In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrazone-bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide is accelerated and the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted towards the hydrazone. Enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP installs a kinetically stable state, at which hydrazone is present at a higher concentration compared to the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of the degradation products of ATP. It is shown that the kinetic state has an enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of an RNA-model compound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactions from Individual Impacts to Global Transformation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single ball drop on a thin layer of loose bis(dibenzoylmethanato)NiII powders induces a partial trimerization reaction as a result of the severe mechanical deformation accompanying the formation of the powder compact. Repeated ball drops on the same powder compact result in an approximately linear increase of the trimer amount.







Abstract
Typically induced by the mechanical processing of powders in ball mills, mechanochemical transformations are considered to result from the application of mechanical force to solid reactants. However, the undeniable deep connection between the dynamic compaction of powders during impacts and the overall transformation degree has yet to be disclosed. In the present work, we show that the square planar bis(dibenzoylmethanato)NiII coordination compound undergoes trimerization when its powder experiences even a single ball impact. Based on systematic experiments with individual ball impacts and analysis by Raman spectroscopy, we provide here quantitative mapping of the transformation in the powder compact and deduce bulk reaction kinetics from multiple individual impacts.

         <title>Asymmetric (4+n) Cycloadditions of Indolyldimethanols for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Indole&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols enable the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. This approach led to the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which show promising anticancer activity. Theoretical calculations offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused rings has become an important issue in the chemical community because of the significance of such scaffolds. In this work, we have accomplished the first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols by using indoles and 2&#8208;naphthols as suitable reaction partners under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acids, constructing enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused six&#8208;membered and seven&#8208;membered rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In addition, this approach is used to realize the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which are found to show promising anticancer activity. More importantly, theoretical calculations of the reaction pathways and activation mode offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols. This work not only settles the challenges in realizing catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of indolyldimethanols but also provides a powerful strategy for the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings.

         <title>Universal Sub&#8208;Nanoreactor Strategy for Synthesis of Yolk&#8208;Shell MoS2 Supported Single Atom Electrocatalysts toward Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by theoretical prediction of the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; at sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy to precisely regulate the spatial location and local microenvironment of metal single atoms (Co, Ni, Fe, Zn, W, Cu, Mn, and Cd) over yolk&#8208;shell C&#8722;MoS2 dual&#8208;support for robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction in acid.







Abstract
The coordination structure determines the electrocatalytic performances of single atom catalysts (SACs), while it remains a challenge to precisely regulate their spatial location and coordination environment. Herein, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy for synthesis of yolk&#8208;shell MoS2 supported single atom electrocatalysts with dual&#8208;anchored microenvironment of vacancy&#8208;enriched MoS2 and intercalation carbon toward robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; are conducive to stabilize and activate metal single atoms. A group of SACs is subsequently produced with the assistance of sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon in the yolk&#8208;shell sub&#8208;nanoreactor. The optimized C&#8722;Co&#8722;MoS2 yields the lowest overpotential (&#951;10=17&#8197;mV) compared with previously reported MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts to date, and also affords a 5&#8211;9 fold improvement in activity even comparing with those as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;anchored analogues. Theoretical results and in situ characterizations unveil its active center and durability. This work provides a universal pathway to design efficient catalysts for electro&#8208;refinery.

         <dc:description>
A methodology involving &#946;&#8208;regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective alkyne hydroamination by using SF4&#8208;alkynes under superbasic, naked anion conditions is disclosed. The reaction is compatible with a wide variety of N&#8208;heterocycles and selectively furnishes Z&#8208;enamines. Moreover, this method was extended to hydrophenoxylation transformations to provide SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl ethers in high yields.







Abstract
Alkyne hydroamination is an effective approach for the production of enamines and enamine&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles. However, stereoselectivity control is a considerable challenge in this reaction because of the electronic repulsion between an incoming nitrogen lone pair and the alkyne &#960;&#8208;system. Herein, we propose a methodology involving &#946;&#8208;regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective alkyne hydroamination by using tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl (SF4) alkynes under superbasic, naked anion conditions. The reaction is compatible with a wide variety of N&#8208;heterocycles, including indoles, carbazoles, pyrazoles, and imidazoles, and selectively furnishes SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl enamines with &#946;&#8208;regioselectively. Moreover, the method can be extended to the &#946;&#8208; and Z&#8208;controlled, base&#8208;mediated alkyne hydrophenoxylation with phenols to provide SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl ethers in high yields. As the SF4 unit has attracted attention as a bioisostere for alkynes, p&#8208;benzenes, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) groups, and cubanes in medicinal chemistry, this chemistry represents an effective approach to creating novel drug candidates incorporating SF4&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208;Soluble Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen with Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interactions for Targeted NIR Imaging of Cancer Cells and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the distinctive structural features of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, a highly water&#8208;soluble type I AIE&#8208;active photosensitizer (DPBC&#8208;Br) with NIR&#8208;I emission was successfully developed through a counterion exchange strategy. DPBC&#8208;Br exhibits a prolonged retention time in tumors and generates type I reactive oxygen species under light irradiation to effectively suppress tumor growth.







Abstract
The low oxygen dependence of type I photosensitizers (PSs) has made them a popular choice for treating solid tumors. However, the drawbacks of poor water solubility, short emission wavelength, poor stability, and inability to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells limit the application of most type I PSs in clinical therapy. Thereby, developing novel type I PSs for overcoming these problems is an urgent but challenging task.

     alt="A Highly Water-Soluble Aggregation-Induced Emission Luminogen with Anion-&#960;+ Interactions for Targeted NIR Imaging of Cancer Cells and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the distinctive structural features of anion-&#960;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions, a highly water-soluble type I AIE-active photosensitizer (DPBC-Br) with NIR-I emission was successfully developed through a counterion exchange strategy. DPBC-Br exhibits a prolonged retention time in tumors and generates type I reactive oxygen species under light irradiation to effectively suppress tumor growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low oxygen dependence of type I photosensitizers (PSs) has made them a popular choice for treating solid tumors. However, the drawbacks of poor water solubility, short emission wavelength, poor stability, and inability to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells limit the application of most type I PSs in clinical therapy. Thereby, developing novel type I PSs for overcoming these problems is an urgent but challenging task. Herein, by utilizing the distinctive structural characteristics of anion-&#960;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions, a highly water-soluble type&#8197;I PS (DPBC-Br) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristic and near-infrared (NIR) emission is fabricated for the first time. DPBC-Br displays remarkable water solubility (7.3&#8197;mM) and outstanding photobleaching resistance, enabling efficient and precise differentiation between tumor cells and normal cells in a wash-free and long-term tracking manner via NIR-I imaging. Additionally, the superior type&#8197;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by DPBC-Br provide both specific killing of cancer cells in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, with negligible systemic toxicity. This study rationally constructs a highly water-soluble type&#8197;I PS, which has higher reliability and controllability compared with conventional nanoparticle formulating procedures, offering great potential for clinical cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Redox&#8208;Neutral Thiolation of Alkyl Halides with Thioformates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient manganese&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral thiolation of alkyl halides with thioformates was developed. This method could be extended to the late&#8208;stage thiolation of structurally complex natural products and pharmaceuticals by using easily synthesized thioformates as thiyl radical precursors.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as an important strategy to furnish thioethers; however, the dominant utilization of noble metal catalysts as well as the construction of challenging C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds by transition metal&#8208;catalysis remain highly problematic. Earth&#8208;abundant manganese has gathered increasing interest as an attractive catalyst for new reaction development; nevertheless, C(sp3)&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reaction by manganese catalysis has not been reported. Herein, we disclose a highly efficient manganese&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral thiolation of a broad range of alkyl halides with thioformates as practical sulfuration agents. Strategically, employing easily synthesized thioformates as thiyl radical precursors allows access to various aryl and alkyl thioethers in good to excellent yields. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral method avoids the utilization of strong bases, external ligands, forcing reaction conditions, and stoichiometric manganese, thus presenting apparent advantages, such as broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and mild reaction conditions. Finally, the utilities of this method are also illustrated by downstream transformations and late&#8208;stage thiolation of structurally complex natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Activation Coupling with a Schottky Junction Boosts the Electrochemiluminescence of Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms and Au nanoparticles anchored on carbon nitride serve as dual active sites for efficiently accelerating charge transfer and activating the co&#8208;reactant peroxydisulfate, while the Schottky junctions between Au nanoparticles and carbon nitride can trap over&#8208;injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation, resulting in a boosted electrochemiluminescence intensity and stable emission.







Abstract
Robust electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of carbon nitride (CN) requires efficient electron&#8208;hole recombination and the suppression of electrode passivation. In this work, Au nanoparticles and single atoms (AuSA+NP) loaded on CN serve as dual active sites that significantly accelerate charge transfer and activate peroxydisulfate. Meanwhile, the well&#8208;established Schottky junctions between Au NPs and CN act as electron sinks, effectively trapping over&#8208;injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation. As a result, the porous CN modified with AuSA+NP exhibits an enhanced and stable ECL emission, with a minimal relative standard deviation of 0.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, the designed ECL biosensor based on AuSA+NP&#8208;CN shows a remarkable performance in detecting organophosphorus pesticides. This innovative strategy has the potential to offer new insights into strong and stable ECL emission for practical applications.

         <title>A Smart Deoxyribozyme&#8208;Programmable Catalytic DNA Circuit for High&#8208;Contrast MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;responsive DNAzyme&#8208;powered entropy&#8208;driven reaction circuit (Dz&#8208;EDR) was proposed for selective and efficient microRNA imaging with high signal gain and ultralow background. Only under the stimulation of endogenous cancerous mRNA, the DNAzyme amplifier was activated to liberate EDR reactants (fuel strands) for powering the downstream EDR&#8208;amplified detection of target microRNA.







Abstract
Synthetic catalytic DNA circuits have been recognized as a promising signal amplification toolbox for sensitive intracellular imaging, yet their selectivity and efficiency are always constrained by uncontrolled off&#8208;site signal leakage and inefficient on&#8208;site circuitry activation. Thus, the endogenously controllable on&#8208;site exposure/activation of DNA circuits is highly desirable for achieving the selective imaging of live cells. Herein, an endogenously activated DNAzyme strategy was facilely integrated with a catalytic DNA circuit for guiding the selective and efficient microRNA imaging in vivo. To prevent the off&#8208;site activation, the circuitry constitute was initially caged without sensing functions, which could be selectively liberated by DNAzyme amplifier to guarantee the high&#8208;contrast microRNA imaging in target cells. This intelligent on&#8208;site modulation strategy can tremendously expand these molecularly engineered circuits in biological systems.

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion in a Diazo&#8208;Functionalized Compound with Switchable Solid&#8208;State Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The switchable solid&#8208;state behavior of diazo&#8208;I is described. Dramatically different and fully reversible thermal expansion (TE) behaviors are obtained on either side of a phase transition. Moderate, positive TE along all axes occurs at low temperature and two&#8208;dimensional, area zero TE coupled with colossal, positive TE occurs at high temperature.







Abstract
Achieving substantial anisotropic thermal expansion (TE) in solid&#8208;state materials is challenging as most materials undergo volumetric expansion upon heating. Here, we describe colossal, anisotropic TE in crystals of an organic compound functionalized with two azo groups. Interestingly, the material exhibits distinct and switchable TE behaviors within different temperature regions. At high temperature, two&#8208;dimensional, area zero TE and colossal, positive linear TE (&#945;=211&#8197;MK&#8722;1) are attained due to dynamic motion, while at low temperature, moderate positive TE occurs in all directions. Investigation of the solid&#8208;state motion showed the change in enthalpy and entropy are quite different in the two temperature regions and solid&#8208;state NMR experiments support motion in the solid. Cycling experiments demonstrate that the solid&#8208;state motions and TE behaviors are completely reversible. These results reveal strategies for designing significant anisotropic and switchable behaviors in solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer Degradation of Vinyl Polymers: Cleavage of a Backbone C&#8722;C Bond Triggered by Radical Activation of a C&#8722;H Bond in a Pendant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonded (meth)acrylate&#8208;based copolymers has been achieved without relying on introduction of a labile bond in the backbone. Carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8722;H) bonds that are specifically active for photocatalyzed HAT reaction were introduced through radical copolymerization with vinyl ether. Radical generation from the C&#8722;H bond in the pendant triggered the cleavage of the strong C&#8722;C bond in the backbone.







Abstract
In this work, we achieved a triggering degradation of polymers composed of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonded backbone without relying on introduction of labile heteroatom&#8208;based bond. The crucial point for the achievement is using vinyl ether (VE) as a comonomer in radical copolymerization of (meth)acrylate for introduction of the carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8722;H) bonds active for photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as triggers in the pendant. Interestingly, methyl methacrylate (MMA)&#8208;n&#8208;butyl vinyl ether (NBVE) copolymer underwent degradation in acetonitrile in the presence of benzophenone (Ph2CO) under UV irradiation at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The degradation did not take place, when any one of UV, Ph2CO, heat, and NBVE unit was removed or HAT&#8208;active solvent such as toluene and 1,4&#8208;dioxane was used. These control experiments strongly supported the HAT&#8208;triggering degradation. Furthermore, the degradation behaviors of the copolymers with other vinyl ethers such as tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether and methyl isopropenyl ether indicated that the C&#8722;H bond neighboring to oxygen on the pendant is mainly responsible for the trigger leading to degradation.

     alt="Photocatalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer Degradation of Vinyl Polymers: Cleavage of a Backbone C&#8722;C Bond Triggered by Radical Activation of a C&#8722;H Bond in a Pendant"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degradation of carbon-carbon (C&#8722;C) bonded (meth)acrylate-based copolymers has been achieved without relying on introduction of a labile bond in the backbone. Carbon-hydrogen (C&#8722;H) bonds that are specifically active for photocatalyzed HAT reaction were introduced through radical copolymerization with vinyl ether. Radical generation from the C&#8722;H bond in the pendant triggered the cleavage of the strong C&#8722;C bond in the backbone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we achieved a triggering degradation of polymers composed of carbon-carbon (C&#8722;C) bonded backbone without relying on introduction of labile heteroatom-based bond. The crucial point for the achievement is using vinyl ether (VE) as a comonomer in radical copolymerization of (meth)acrylate for introduction of the carbon-hydrogen (C&#8722;H) bonds active for photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as triggers in the pendant. Interestingly, methyl methacrylate (MMA)-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl vinyl ether (NBVE) copolymer underwent degradation in acetonitrile in the presence of benzophenone (Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) under UV irradiation at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The degradation did not take place, when any one of UV, Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, heat, and NBVE unit was removed or HAT-active solvent such as toluene and 1,4-dioxane was used. These control experiments strongly supported the HAT-triggering degradation. Furthermore, the degradation behaviors of the copolymers with other vinyl ethers such as &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl vinyl ether and methyl isopropenyl ether indicated that the C&#8722;H bond neighboring to oxygen on the pendant is mainly responsible for the trigger leading to degradation. The HAT-triggering degradation was also demonstrated even with the acrylate-based copolymer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Triggered Structural Defects in Au44 Homologues Boost Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected nanocluster homologues is demonstrated, with a unified formula of Au44(PPh3)n(TBBT)28&#8722;2n (n=0&#8211;2) and similar cuboctahedral interpenetrating structures. The structural defects at the bottom of the Au44(PPh3)(TBBT)26 nanocluster facilitate electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO by lowering the free energy for the *COOH formation.







Abstract
The systematic induction of structural defects at the atomic level is crucial to metal nanocluster research because it endows cluster&#8208;based catalysts with highly reactive centers and allows for a comprehensive investigation of viable reaction pathways. Herein, by substituting neutral phosphine ligands for surface anionic thiolate ligands, we establish that one or two Au3 triangular units can be successfully introduced into the double&#8208;stranded helical kernel of Au44(TBBT)28, where TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzenethiolate, resulting in the formation of two atomically precise defective Au44 nanoclusters. Along with the regular face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) nanocluster, the first series of mixed&#8208;ligand cluster homologues is identified, with a unified formula of Au44(PPh3)n(TBBT)28&#8722;2n (n=0&#8211;2). The Au44(PPh3)(TBBT)26 nanocluster having major structural defects at the bottom of the fcc lattice demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction to CO. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the active site near the defects significantly lowers the free energy for the *COOH formation, the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole catalytic process.

         <title>An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Tackling Conformational Energy Uncertainties in Chiroptical Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical spectroscopies are key to determine the absolute configuration of solvated compounds. Their reliability critically depends on computed Boltzmann factors which are, however, intrinsically inaccurate. Combining a genetic algorithm and a hierarchical clustering analysis enables a major improvement of the analysis of chiroptical spectra and the reliability of the assignment.







Abstract
Determination of the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for obtaining a fundamental understanding in any chirality&#8208;related field. The interaction with polarised light has proven to be a powerful means to determine this absolute configuration, but its application rests on the comparison between experimental and computed spectra for which the inherent uncertainty in conformational Boltzmann factors has proven to be extremely hard to tackle. Here we present a novel approach that overcomes this issue by combining a genetic algorithm that identifies the relevant conformers by accounting for the uncertainties in DFT relative energies, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm that analyses the trends in the spectra of the considered conformers and identifies on&#8208;the&#8208;fly when a given chiroptical technique is not able to make reliable predictions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by considering the challenging cases of papuamine and haliclonadiamine, two bis&#8208;indane natural products with eight chiral centres and considerable conformational heterogeneity that could not be assigned unambiguously with current approaches.

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Neutral Ceramidase in Diabetic Foot Ulcers with an Optimized Substrate and Chemoenzymatic Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a bacteria&#8208;specific substrate and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes were designed for detecting secreted ceramidase from diabetic foot ulcer microbiota. The combination of these biochemical tools together with mass spectrometry analysis and 16S full&#8208;length sequencing highlighted a potential role of bacterial ceramidase in exacerbating wound infection.







Abstract
Ceramidases (CDases) are important in controlling skin barrier integrity by regulating ceramide composition and affording downstream signal molecules. While the functions of epidermal CDases are known, roles of neutral CDases secreted by skin&#8208;residing microbes are undefined. Here, we developed a one&#8208;step fluorogenic substrate, S&#8208;B, for specific detection of bacterial CDase activity and inhibitor screening. We identified a non&#8208;hydrolyzable substrate mimic, C6, as the best hit. Based on C6, we designed a photoaffinity probe, JX&#8208;1, which efficiently detects bacterial CDases. Using JX&#8208;1, we identified endogenous low&#8208;abundance PaCDase in a P. aeruginosa monoculture and in a mixed skin bacteria culture. Harnessing both S&#8208;B and JX&#8208;1, we found that CDase activity positively correlates with the relative abundance of P. aeruginosa and is negatively associated with wound area reduction in clinical diabetic foot ulcer patient samples. Overall, our study demonstrates that bacterial CDases are important regulators of skin ceramides and potentially play a role in wound healing.

The efficient synthesis of the rare sugar 2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;glucuronate was achieved using our recently introduced organocatalytic glycosylation method. We found, for the first time, that long&#8208;range levulinoyl group participation via a hydrogen bond can result in a significantly improved &#946;&#8208;selectivity in glycosylations. This solves the stereoselectivity problem of highly branched galactose acceptors. The proposed mechanism was supported by control experiments and DFT computations. Benefiting from the long&#8208;range levulinoyl group participation strategy, the pentasaccharide donor and acceptor were obtained via an efficient [2+1+2] one&#8208;pot glycosylation method and were used for the target decasaccharide synthesis.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic Synthesis: Concepts and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis is the conversion of electrical energy into value&#8208;added chemicals via a biocatalyst. Bioelectrosynthetic methods utilize the specificity and selectivity of biocatalytic enzymatic or microbial species to carry out chemical redox transformations while utilizing electricity as a stoichiometric redox equivalent. As a merging of biocatalysis and electrocatalysis, these methods directly address challenges in green and sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, fuels, feedstocks and fertilizers. Despite the rising importance of bioelectrochemical transformations across these industries, there remains a high barrier for adoption due to the specialized experimental setups and domain knowledge for bioelectrocatalysis. This review aims to introduce the key concepts and design features of bioelectrosynthetic systems. A tutorial on the methods of biocatalyst utilization and the setup of bioelectrosynthetic cells is provided, as well as an overview of the analytical methods used for assessing bioelectrocatalysts. Key studies illustrating the vital applications of bioelectrosynthesis are outlined, such as ammonia production, small&#8208;molecule synthesis, and multi&#8208;carbon product formation. Finally, we address future directions for both microbial and enzymatic electrosynthetic methods. In summary, this review provides a critically necessary introduction to the field and a collection of resources for the non&#8208;specialist interested in pursuing a research program in bioelectrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the ~1 nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lattice tuning at the ~1 nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a ~1 nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8211;ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 (CHT = S&#8208;c&#8208;C6H11) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58 &#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice&#8208;compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) compared to that exhibited by the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 (TBBT = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters. Further theoretical calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>[2+2+1+1] Cycloaddition for de novo Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique benzannulation strategy for regioselective de novo synthesis of densely functionalized phenols is described. Through metal&#8208;mediated formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO, a series of densely functionalized phenols were obtained. The benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Modulated 1,3&#8208;Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Carboboration of Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While chain&#8208;walking stimulates wide interest in both polymerization and organic synthesis, site&#8208; and stereoselective control of chain&#8208;walking on rings is still a challenging task in the realm of organometallic catalysis. Inspired by a controllable chain&#8208;walking on cyclohexane rings in olefin polymerization, we have developed a set of chain&#8208;walking carboborations of cyclcohexenes based on nickel catalysis. Different from the 1,4&#8208;trans&#8208;selectivity disclosed in polymer science, a high level of 1,3&#8208;regio&#8208; and cis&#8208;stereoselectivity is obtained in our reactions. Mechanistically, we discovery that the base affects the reduction ability of B2pin2 and different bases lead to different catalytic cycles and different regioselective products (1,2&#8208; Vs 1,3&#8208;addition). This study provides a concise and modular method for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexylboron compounds. The incorporation of a readily modifiable boronate group greatly enhances the value of this method, the synthetic potential of which was highlighted by the synthesis of a series of high&#8208;valued commercial chemicals and pharmaceutically interesting molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Ni(Co)&#8208;Ru&#8208;P Sites Activate Dehydrogenation for Hydrazine Oxidation Assisting Self&#8208;powered H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis for H2 production is restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), using thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has attracted ever&#8208;growing attention. Herein, we report a twisted NiCoP nanowire arrays immobilized with Ru single atoms (Ru1&#8208;NiCoP) as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing an ultralow working potential of &#8208;60 mV and overpotential of 32 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Inspiringly, two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer based on overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) demonstrates outstanding activity with a record&#8208;high current density of 522 mA cm&#8208;2 at cell voltage of 0.3 V. DFT calculations elucidate the cooperative Ni(Co)&#8208;Ru&#8208;P sites in Ru1&#8208;NiCoP optimize H* adsorption, and enhance adsorption of *N2H2 to significantly lower the energy barrier for hydrazine dehydrogenation. Moreover, a self&#8208;powered H2 production system utilizing OHzS device driven by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) achieve a satisfactory rate of 24.0 mol h&#8722;1 m&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Paramagnetic Compass Based on Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroscopic compass&#8208;like magnetic alignment at low magnetic fields is natural for ferromagnetic materials but is seldomly observed in paramagnetic materials. Herein, we report a&#160; "paramagnetic compass" that magnetically aligns under ~mT fields based on the single&#8208;crystalline framework constructed by lanthanide ions and organic ligands (Ln&#8208;MOF). The magnetic alignment is attributed to the Ln&#8208;MOF's strong macroscopic anisotropy, where the highly&#8208;ordered structure allows the Ln&#8208;ions' molecular anisotropy to be summed according to the crystal symmetry. In tetragonal Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignment is either parallel or perpendicular to the field depending on the easiest axis of the molecular anisotropy. Reversible switching between the two alignments is realized upon the removal and re&#8208;adsorption of solvent molecules filled in the framework. When the crystal symmetry is lowered in monoclinic Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignments become even inclined (47&#176;~66&#176;) to the field. These fascinating properties of Ln&#8208;MOFs would encourage further explorations of framework materials containing paramagnetic centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Double Perovskite Derived Halides Based on Bi and Alkali Metals (K, Rb): Diverse Structures, Tunable Optical Properties and Second Harmonic Generation Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double perovskites (DP) have attracted extensive attention due to their rich structures and wide application prospects in the field of optoelectronics. Here, we report 15 new Bi&#8208;based double perovskite derived halides with the general formula of A2BBiX6 (A = organic cationic ligand, B = K or Rb, X = Br or I). These materials are synthesized using organic ligands to coordinate with metal ions with a sp3 oxygen, and diverse structure types were obtained with distinct dimensionalities and connectivity modes. The optical band gaps of these phases can be tuned by changing the halide, the organic ligand and the alkali metal, varying from 2.0 to 2.9 eV. The bromide phases exhibit increasing photoluminescence (PL) intensity with decreasing temperature, while the PL intensity of iodide phases changes nonmonotonically with temperature. Because the majority of these phases are non&#8208;centrosymmetric, second harmonic generation (SHG) responses are also measured for selected non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, showing different particle&#8208;size&#8208;dependent trends. Our findings give rise to a series of new structural types to the DP family, and provide a powerful synthetic handle for symmetry breaking.</dc:description>

The optical band gaps of these phases can be tuned by changing the halide, the organic ligand and the alkali metal, varying from 2.0 to 2.9 eV. The bromide phases exhibit increasing photoluminescence (PL) intensity with decreasing temperature, while the PL intensity of iodide phases changes nonmonotonically with temperature. Because the majority of these phases are non-centrosymmetric, second harmonic generation (SHG) responses are also measured for selected non-centrosymmetric materials, showing different particle-size-dependent trends. Our findings give rise to a series of new structural types to the DP family, and provide a powerful synthetic handle for symmetry breaking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Photochemical Deracemization via Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon irradiation in the presence of a suitable chiral catalyst, racemic compound mixtures can be converted into enantiomerically pure compounds with the same constitution. The process is called photochemical deracemization and involves the formation of shortlived, achiral intermediates. By opening different reaction channels for the forward reaction to the intermediate and for the re&#8208;constitution of the chiral molecule, the entropically disfavored process becomes feasible. Since the discovery of the first photochemical deracemization in 2018, the field has been growing rapidly. This review comprehensively covers the research performed in the area and discusses current developments. It is subdivided according to the mode of action and the respective substrate classes. The focus of this review is on the scope of the individual reactions and on a discussion of the mechanistic details underlying the presented reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersion Energy&#8208;Stabilized Boron and Phosphorus Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An isostructural series of boron/phosphorus Lewis pairs was systematically investigated. The association constants of the Lewis pairs were determined at variable temperatures, enabling the extraction of thermodynamic parameters. The stabilization of the Lewis adduct increased with increasing size of the dispersion energy donor groups, although the donor and acceptor properties of the Lewis pairs remained largely unchanged. This data was utilized to challenge state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical methods, which finally led to an enhanced workflow for the determination of thermochemical properties of weakly bound Lewis pairs within an accuracy of 0.6 to 1.0 kcal&#8226;mol&#8211;1 for computed association free energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Performance Descriptors for Catalysts Based on Molybdenum, Tungsten, or Rhenium Oxides for Metathesis of Ethylene with 2&#8208;Butenes to Propene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metathesis of ethylene with 2&#8208;butenes to propene is an established large&#8208;scale process. However, the fundamentals behind in situ transformation of supported WOx, MoOx, or ReOx species into catalytically active metal&#8208;carbenes and the intrinsic activity of the latter as well as the role of metathesis&#8208;inactive cocatalysts are still unsolved that is detrimental for catalyst development and process optimization. In this study, we provide the required essentials owing to steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis. For the first time, the steady&#8208;state concentration, the lifetime, and the intrinsic reactivity of metal carbenes were determined. The obtained results can be directly used for the design and the preparation of metathesis&#8208;active catalysts and cocatalysts that opens the possibility for optimizing propene productivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized DNA Circuit to Establish an Artificial Interaction between T Cells and Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nongenetic strategies that enable control over the cell&#8208;cell interaction network would be highly desired, particularly in T cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we developed an aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit to modulate the interaction between T cells and cancer cells. This DNA circuit was composed of recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules. Upon recognizing target cancer cells, the triggering strand was released to induce aggregation of immune receptors on the T cell surface, leading to an enhancement of T cell activity for effective cancer eradication. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this DNA circuit for promoting target cancer cell&#8208;directed stimulation of T cells, which, consequently, enhanced their killing effect on cancer cells. This DNA circuit, as a modular strategy to modulate intercellular interactions, could lead to a new paradigm for the development of nongenetic T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrochemical Activation of Hydroxyl Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The slow reaction kinetics and structural instability of organic electrode materials limit the further performance improvement of aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we have synthesized a Z&#8208;folded hydroxyl polymer polytetrafluorohydroquinone (PTFHQ) with inert hydroxyl groups that could be partially oxidized to the active carbonyl groups through the in&#8208;situ activation process and then undertake the storage/release of Zn2+. In the activated PTFHQ, the hydroxyl groups and S atoms enlarge the electronegativity region near the electrochemically active carbonyl groups, enhancing their electrochemical activity. Simultaneously, the residual hydroxyl groups could act as hydrophilic groups to enhance the electrolyte wettability while ensuring the stability of the polymer chain in the electrolyte. Also, the Z&#8208;folded structure of PTFHQ plays an important role in reversible binding with Zn2+ and fast ion diffusion. All these benefits make the activated PTFHQ exhibit a high specific capacity of 215 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, over 3400 stable cycles with a capacity retention of 92%, and an outstanding rate capability of 196 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Aided Thermoelectric Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;grade heat is ubiquitous in the environment and its thermoelectric conversion by the ionic conductors remains a challenge because of the low efficiency and poor sustainability. Here we demonstrate that the thermoelectric performances can be boosted by combining the Soret effect of protons and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction of benzoquinone and hydroquinone in hydrogels. An overall enhancement of thermopower (25.9 mV K&#8208;1), power factor (5 mW m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2), figure of merit (&gt;2.4) and continuity of power output is achieved. Moreover, an energy&#8208;storage function can be achieved by the redox couple, and a retained power output of 27.7%, or 14 mW m&#8208;2 for more than 3 hours is obtained by the re&#8208;balance of PCET reactants in the hydrogel after the removal of the temperature gradient.</dc:description>

         <title>Extension of Nonalternant Nanographenes Containing Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonalternant topologies have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics in recent years. Here, three novel topological nanographenes molecular models of nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales (S&#8210;T&#8210;W) defect were achieved through direct arylation. Their chemical structures were unambiguously elucidated by single crystal analysis. Among them, threefold intramolecular direct arylation compound (C42H21N) is the largest nanographene bearing a N&#8208;doped nonalternant topology to date, in which the non&#8208;benzenoid rings account for 83% of the total molecular skeleton. The absorption maxima of this compound was located in the near&#8208;infrared region with a long tail up to 900 nm, which was much longer than those reported for similarly sized N&#8208;doped nanographene with six&#8208;membered rings (C40H15N). In addition, the electronic energy gaps of these series compounds obviously decreased with the introduction of nonalternant topologies (from 2.27 eV to 1.50 eV). It is noteworthy that C42H21N possesses such a low energy gap (Egopt = 1.40 eV; Egcv = 1.50 eV), yet is highly stable under ambient conditions. Our work reported herein demonstrates that the nonalternant topology could significantly influence the electronic configurations of nanocarbons, where the introduction of a nonalternanting topology may be an effective way to narrow the energy gap without extending the molecular &#960;&#8208;conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding and Acidity of the Formal Hydride in the Prototypical Au9(PPh3)82+&#160;Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of hydrogen atoms as surface ligands on metal nanoclusters is of profound importance but remains difficult to directly study.&#160; While hydrogen atoms often appear to be incorporated formally as hydrides, evidence suggests that they donate electrons to the cluster's delocalized superatomic orbitals and may consequently behave as acidic protons that play key roles in synthetic or catalytic mechanisms.&#160; Here we directly test this assertion for the prototypical Au9(PPh3)8H2+&#160;nanocluster, formed by addition of a hydride to the well&#8208;characterized Au9(PPh3)83+.&#160; Using gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy, we were able to unambiguously isolate Au9(PPh3)8H2+ and Au9(PPh3)8D2+, revealing an Au&#8208;H stretching mode at 1528 cm&#8208;1&#160;that shifts to 1038 cm&#8208;1&#160;upon deuteration. This shift is greater than the maximum expected for a typical harmonic potential, suggesting a potential governing cluster&#8208;H bonding that has square&#8208;well character consistent with the hydrogen nucleus behaving as a metal atom in the cluster core.&#160; Complexing this cluster with very weak bases reveals a redshift of 39 cm&#8208;1&#160;in the Au&#8208;H vibration, consistent with those typically seen for moderately acidic groups in gas phase molecules and providing an estimate of the acidity of Au9(PPh3)8H2+, at least with regard to its surface reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Stabilization of a Dinickel Catalyst in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although many monometallic active sties have been installed in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalytic reactions, there are no effective strategies to generate bimetallic catalysts in MOFs. Here we report the synthesis of a robust, efficient, and reusable MOF catalyst, MOF&#8208;NiH, by adaptively generating and stabilizing dinickel active sites using the bipyridine groups in MOF&#8208;253 with the formula of Al(OH)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) for Z&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes and selective hydrogenation of C=C bonds in &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Spectroscopic studies established the dinickel complex (bpy&#8729;&#8208;)NiII(&#956;2&#8208;H)2NiII(bpy&#8729;&#8208;) as the active catalyst. MOF&#8208;NiH efficiently catalyzed selective hydrogenation reactions with turnover numbers of up to 192 and could be used in five cycles of hydrogenation reactions without catalyst leaching or significant decrease of catalytic activities. The present work uncovers a synthetic strategy toward solution&#8208;inaccessible Earth&#8208;abundant bimetallic MOF catalysts for sustainable catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Amine Synthesis via Iterative Boron Homologation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The value of Matteson&#8208;type reactions has been increasingly recognized for developing automated organic synthesis. However, the typical Matteson reactions almost exclusively focus on homologation of carbon units. Here, we report the detailed development of sequential insertion of nitrogen and carbon atoms into boronate C&#8722;B bonds, which provides a modular and iterative approach to access functionalized tertiary amines. A new class of nitrenoid reagents is uncovered to allow direct formation of aminoboranes from aryl or alkyl boronates via N&#8208;insertion. The one&#8208;pot N&#8208;insertion followed by controlled mono&#8208; or double&#8208;carbenoid insertion has been realized with widely available aryl boronates. The resulting aminoalkyl boronate products can undergo further homologation and various other transformations. Preliminary success on homologation of N,N&#8208;dialkylaminoboranes and sequential N&#8208; and C&#8208;insertions with alkyl boronates have also been achieved. To broaden the synthetic utility, selective removal of a benzyl or aryl substituent permits access to secondary or primary amine products. The application of this method has been demonstrated in the modular synthesis of bioactive compounds&#160;and the programmable construction of diamines and aminoethers. A plausible reaction mechanism, supported by preliminary NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and computational studies, is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Superiority of Nonbenzenoid Acepleiadylene as a Building Block for Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acepleiadylene (APD), a nonbenzenoid isomer of pyrene, exhibits a unique charge&#8208;separated character with a large molecular dipole and a small optical gap. However, APD has never been explored in optoelectronic materials to take advantage of these appealing properties. Here, we employ APD as a building block in organic semiconducting materials for the first time, and unravel the superiority of nonbenzenoid APD in electronic applications. We have synthesized an APD derivative (APD&#8208;IID) with APD as the terminal donor moieties and isoindigo (IID) as the acceptor core. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that APD&#8208;IID has an obvious charge&#8208;separated structure and enhanced intermolecular interactions as compared with its pyrene&#8208;based isomers. As a result, APD&#8208;IID displays significantly higher hole mobilities than that of the pyrene&#8208;based counterparts. These results imply the advantages of employing APD in semiconducting materials and great potential of nonbenzenoid polycyclic arenes for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Hypervalent Iodine Reagent Chimeras: Enabling Peptide Functionalization and Macrocyclization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents&#8212;ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8212;onto peptides is described. These peptide&#8208;EBX chimeras can be used as versatile handles for peptide/protein modifications and peptide macrocyclization under mild photocatalytic conditions. The method was used to access new inhibitors of the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 interaction.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for the modification of peptides based on the introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents&#8212;ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8212;onto peptides. These peptide&#8208;EBXs can be readily accessed, by both solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein through reaction with Cys, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine adducts in water buffer. Furthermore, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C&#8208;terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye and was also successful in an intramolecular fashion, leading to macrocyclic peptides with unprecedented crosslinking. A rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity for Keap1 at the Nrf2 binding site with potential protein&#8208;protein interaction inhibition.

         <title>Ru&#8722;FeNi Alloy Heterojunctions on Lignin&#8208;derived Carbon as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a nove lignin&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;supported Ru&#8722;FeNi@NLC heterojunction catalyst for water electrolysis was proposed. The synergistic interaction between the heterogeneous structure and the lignin&#8208;derived carbon layer produced a total water decomposition interface adjustment of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.48&#8197;V, which reduced the energy barrier and improved the reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Rational design of efficient, stable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a key challenge to realize green hydrogen production via electrolytic water splitting. Herein, Ru nanoparticles and FeNi alloy heterojunction catalyst (Ru&#8722;FeNi@NLC) encapsulated via lignin&#8208;derived carbon was prepared by self&#8208;assembly precipitation and in situ pyrolysis. The designed catalyst displays excellent performance at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with low overpotentials of 36&#8197;mV for HER and 198&#8197;mV for OER, and only needs 1.48&#8197;V for overall water splitting. Results and DFT calculations show the unique N&#8208;doped lignin&#8208;derived carbon layer and Ru&#8722;FeNi heterojunction contribute to optimized electronic structure for enhancing electron transfer, balanced free energy of reactants and intermediates in the sorption/desorption process, and significantly reduced reaction energy barrier for the HER and OER rate&#8208;determining steps, thus improved reaction kinetics. This work provides a new in situ pyrolysis doping strategy based on renewable biomass for the construction of highly active, stable and cost&#8208;effective catalysts.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Driven Assembly of a Penta&#8208;Shell Keplerate Cuprofullerene for Metallofullerene Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Icosahedral penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully assembled, templated by a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8722;CuI and CuI&#8722;Cl coordination bonds canopied with 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer. They are interconnected to form 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks by sharing the outmost Cl atoms.







Abstract
Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully prepared via a C60&#8208;templated symmetry&#8208;driven strategy. The icosahedral cuprofullerene chloride is assembled on a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8722;CuI and CuI&#8722;Cl coordination bonds, resulting in the penta&#8208;shell Keplerate with the C60 core canopied by 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms that fulfill the tic@rco@oae@ico@ico penta&#8208;shell polyhedral configuration. By sharing the outmost&#8208;shell Cl atoms, the cuprofullerene chlorides are connected into 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks. TD&#8208;DFT calculations reveal that the charge transfer from the outmost CuI and Cl to C60 core is responsible for their light absorption expansion to near&#8208;infrared region, implying anionic halogenation may be an effective strategy to tune the light absorption properties of metallofullerene materials.

         <title>An Efficient Direct Arylation Polycondensation via C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8722;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers. Moreover, the mechanism studies highlighted the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis. Of note, CPs synthesized in this method possessed low trap densities, high Mns and charge transport mobility, signifying an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.







Abstract
The direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) has become one of the most important methods to construct conjugated polymers (CPs). However, the homocoupling side&#8208;reactions of aryl halides and the low regioseletive reactivities of unfunctionalized aryls hinder the development of DArP. Here, an efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8722;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers, of which robustness was exemplified by over twenty conjugated polymers (CPs), including copolymers, homopolymers, and random polymers. The capture of oxidative addition intermediate together with experimental and theoretic results suggested the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis with a bicyclic mechanism. The studies of NMR, molecular weights, trap densities, two&#8208;dimensional grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (2D&#8208;GIWAXS), and the charge transport mobilities revealed that the homocoupling reactions were significantly suppressed with high regioselectivity of unfunctionalized aryls, suggesting this method is an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.

         <title>Fast Modulation of d&#8208;Band Holes Quantity in the Early Reaction Stages for Boosting Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;loading iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes character during the reaction process was designed as an efficient OER catalyst in acidic solutions. The in situ modulated d&#8208;band holes and near&#8208;steady XO*&#8722;Ir&#8722;N4 moieties at early working voltages are responsible for the observed high activity and stability.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts applied in acidic water electrolysis remains a grand challenge. Here, we construct a type of high&#8208;loading iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes character (h&#8208;HL&#8722;Ir SACs, &#8764;17.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Ir) realized in the early OER operation stages. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the quantity of the d&#8208;band holes of Ir active sites can be fast increased by 0.56 unit from the open circuit to a low working potential of 1.35&#8197;V. More remarkably, in situ synchrotron infrared and Raman spectroscopies demonstrate the quick accumulation of *OOH and *OH intermediates over holes&#8208;modulated Ir sites in the early reaction voltages, achieving a rapid OER kinetics. As a result, this well&#8208;designed h&#8208;HL&#8722;Ir SACs exhibits superior performance for acidic OER with overpotentials of 216&#8197;mV @10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 259&#8197;mV @100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to a small Tafel slope of 43&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The activity of catalyst shows no evident attenuation after 60&#8197;h operation in acidic environment. This work provides some useful hints for the design of superior acidic OER catalysts.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis with 63.5&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 100&#8201;% N&#8208;Selectivity via One&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrogen is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling via direct insertion of CO into N2 molecules is the internal cause for the &#8764;100&#8201;% N&#8208;selectivity to urea.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis via coupling N2 and CO2 provides an effective route to mitigate energy crisis and close carbon footprint. However, the difficulty on breaking N&#8801;N is the main reason that caused low efficiencies for both electrocatalytic NH3 and urea synthesis, which is the bottleneck restricting their industrial applications. Herein, a new mechanism to overcome the inert of the nitrogen molecule was proposed by elongating N&#8801;N instead of breaking N&#8801;N to realize one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling in the process for urea production. We constructed a Zn&#8722;Mn diatomic catalyst with axial chloride coordination, Zn&#8722;Mn sites display high tolerance to CO poisoning and the Faradaic efficiency can even be increased to 63.5&#8201;%, which is the highest value that has ever been reported. More importantly, negligible N&#8801;N bond breakage effectively avoids the generation of ammonia as intermediates, therefore, the N&#8208;selectivity in the co&#8208;electrocatalytic system reaches100&#8201;% for urea synthesis. The previous cognition that electrocatalysts for urea synthesis must possess ammonia synthesis activity has been broken. Isotope&#8208;labelled measurements and Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validate that activation of N&#8722;N triple bond and nitrogen fixation activity arise from the one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling process of CO species with adsorbed N2 molecules.

         <title>Do Corroles Stabilize Tetravalent Antimony?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ligand radical instead of an antimony(IV) species forms upon the oxidation of antimony(III)corroles in the absence of hard donor ligands. EPR investigations reveal a strong coupling of the unpaired electron to the 121Sb and 123Sb nuclei due to a small 5&#8197;s orbital contribution of the SOMO. The compound undergoes a redox disproportionation in the presence of water which can be applied to prepare the elusive hydroxo antimony(V)corrole.







Abstract
Antimony corrole cations have been prepared by one&#8208;electron oxidation of antimony(III) congeners with silver(I) and copper(II) salts. Isolation and crystallization was successful for the first time, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic investigation unraveled structural similarities with antimony(III)corroles. EPR experiments showed strong hyperfine interactions of the unpaired electron with the 121Sb (I=5/2) and 123Sb nuclei (I=7/2). A DFT analysis supports the description of the oxidized form as a SbIII corrole radical with less than 2&#8201;% SbIV character. In the presence of water or a fluoride source like PF6&#8722;, the compounds undergo a redox disproportionation to yield known antimony(III)corroles and either difluorido&#8208;antimony(V)corroles, or bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxido&#8208;di[antimony(V)corroles] via novel cationic hydroxo&#8208;antimony(V) derivatives.

         <title>Photosynthesis&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Biomineralization of Gold Nanoparticles inside Chlorella Cells towards Hydrogen Boosting under Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthesis&#8208;mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain was achieved. The electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of the biomineralized AuNPs could augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which gives rise to an 8.3&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen production under 560&#8197;nm light irradiation.







Abstract
Engineering living microorganisms to enhance green biomanufacturing for the development of sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral energy strategies has attracted the interest of researchers from a wide range of scientific communities. In this study, we develop a method to achieve photosynthesis&#8208;mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells, where the photosynthesis&#8208;dominated reduction of Au3+ to Au0 allows the formed AuNPs to locate preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain. In particular, we reveal that the electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs could greatly augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which then promotes the generation and transferring of photoelectrons throughout the photosynthetic chain for augmented hydrogen production under sunlight. We demonstrate that the electrons from AuNPs could be directly transferred to hydrogenase, giving rise to an 8.3&#8208;fold enhancement of Chlorella cells hydrogen production independent of the cellular photosynthetic process under monochromatic 560&#8197;nm light irradiation. Overall, the photosynthesis&#8208;mediated intracellular biomineralization of AuNPs could contribute to a novel paradigm for functionalizing Chlorella cells to augment biomanufacturing.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Enhanced Chemical&#8208;Vapor&#8208;Deposition Synthesis of Photoredox&#8208;Active Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon from NH3 and CH4 Gases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH3 and CH4 gases were applied as precursors to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC) photocatalysts. Without any co&#8208;catalysts, the NDC was demonstrated to drive photoredox reactions, and active sites on the NDC have been investigated. Because in the Archean era, the atmosphere of Earth was filled with NH3 and CH4 gases, this study is important to understand the evolution of biomolecules in the Earth by photochemistry.







Abstract
Earth's primordial atmosphere was rich in ammonia and methane. To understand the evolution of the atmosphere, these two gases were used to make photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). Photocatalysts such as NDC might play an important role in the development of geological and atmospheric chemistry during the Archean era. This study describes the synthesis of NDC directly from NH3 and CH4 gases. The photocatalyst product can be used to selectively synthesize imines by photo&#8208;oxidization of amines, producing H2O2 simultaneously in the photoreduction reaction.

     alt="Plasma-Enhanced Chemical-Vapor-Deposition Synthesis of Photoredox-Active Nitrogen-Doped Carbon from NH3 and CH4 Gases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gases were applied as precursors to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon (NDC) photocatalysts. Without any co-catalysts, the NDC was demonstrated to drive photoredox reactions, and active sites on the NDC have been investigated. Because in the Archean era, the atmosphere of Earth was filled with NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gases, this study is important to understand the evolution of biomolecules in the Earth by photochemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth's primordial atmosphere was rich in ammonia and methane. To understand the evolution of the atmosphere, these two gases were used to make photoredox-active nitrogen-doped carbon (NDC). Photocatalysts such as NDC might play an important role in the development of geological and atmospheric chemistry during the Archean era. This study describes the synthesis of NDC directly from NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gases. The photocatalyst product can be used to selectively synthesize imines by photo-oxidization of amines, producing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously in the photoreduction reaction. Our findings shed light on the chemical evolution of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal Catalysis in Living Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Novel Supramolecular Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal catalysis is a powerful tool in synthetic chemistry; however, it has yet to reach its full potential in living cells. The hostile environment of cells towards metal complexes means that new strategies need to be developed to overcome poor reactivity.







Abstract
The importance of transition metal catalysis is exemplified by its wide range of applications, for example in the synthesis of chemicals, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. However, one relatively new application is for carrying out new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions inside living cells. The complex environment of a living cell is not welcoming to transition metal catalysts, as a diverse range of biological components have the potential to inhibit or deactivate the catalyst. Here we review the current progress in the field of transition metal catalysis, and evaluation of catalysis efficiency in living cells and under biological (relevant) conditions. Catalyst poisoning is a ubiquitous problem in this field, and we propose that future research into the development of physical and kinetic protection strategies may provide a route to improve the reactivity of catalysts in cells.

         <title>Circumpentacene with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable circumpentacene derivative was successfully synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations revealed that it shows an open&#8208;shell diradical character and a dominant local aromatic character. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
Circumacenes (CAs) are a distinctive type of benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons where an acene unit is completely enclosed by a layer of outer fused benzene rings. Despite their unique structures, the synthesis of CAs is challenging, and until recently, the largest CA molecule synthesized was circumanthracene. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of an extended circumpentacene derivative 1, which represents the largest CA molecule synthesized to date. Its structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. It shows a unique open&#8208;shell diradical character due to the existence of extended zigzag edges, with a moderate diradical character index (y0=39.7&#8201;%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;4.47&#8197;kcal/mol). It exhibits a dominant local aromatic character with &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized in the individual aromatic sextet rings. It has a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion can be considered as doubly charged structures in which two coronene units are fused with a central aromatic benzene ring. This study provides a new route toward stable multizigzag&#8208;edged graphene&#8208;like molecules with open&#8208;shell di/polyradical character.

         <title>Cu Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;Atom catalysts are used as selective catalysts for acetylene hydrogenation. The adsorption of acetylene and ethylene intermediates on the active site can be weakened by separating the continuous active sites into single sites, thereby increasing the energy barrier of overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, and inhibiting side reactions.







Abstract
The site isolation strategy has been employed in thermal catalytic acetylene semihydrogenation to inhibit overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling. However, there is a dearth of analogous investigations in electrocatalytic systems. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) simulations demonstrate that isolated Cu metal sites have higher energy barriers on overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling. Following this result, we develop Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts highly dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix, which exhibit high ethylene selectivity (&gt;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene, &lt;1&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for C4, and no ethane) at high concentrations of acetylene. The superior performance observed in the electrocatalytic selective hydrogenation of acetylene can be attributed to the weak adsorption of ethylene intermediates and highly energy barriers on C&#8722;C coupling at isolated sites, as confirmed by both DFT calculations and experimental results. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the isolated sites inhibiting the side reactions of electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.

         <title>Palladium and Ruthenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Porous Ionic Polymers for Acetylene Dialkoxycarbonylation: Synergetic Effects Stabilize the Active Site and Increase CO Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous Pd1&#8722;Ru1 dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms catalyst supported on porous ionic polymers was fabricated via a wet impregnation method and applied in acetylene dialkoxycarbonylation. The molecular structure of the Pd1&#8722;Ru1 catalyst was determined to be [P]+&#8722;[PdI3&#8722;I&#8722;RuCl2(CO)3]&#8722;, with a synergetic effect between the neighboring Pd1 and Ru1 single sites elevating the overall activity and stabilizing the active site.







Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts usually suffer from poor stability, thereby limiting industrial applications. Dual Pd1&#8722;Ru1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;sites supported on porous ionic polymers (Pd1&#8722;Ru1/PIPs) were constructed using a wetness impregnation method. The two isolated metal species in the form of a binuclear complex were immobilized on the cationic framework of PIPs through ionic bonds. Compared to the single Pd&#8208; or Ru&#8208;site catalyst, the dual single&#8208;atom system exhibits higher activity with 98&#8201;% acetylene conversion and near 100&#8201;% selectivity to dialkoxycarbonylation products, as well as better cycling stability for ten cycles without obvious decay. Based on DFT calculations, it was found that the single&#8208;Ru site exhibited a strong CO adsorption energy of &#8722;1.6&#8197;eV, leading to an increase in the local CO concentration of the catalyst. Notably, the Pd1&#8722;Ru1/PIPs catalyst had a much lower energy barrier of 2.49&#8197;eV compared to 3.87&#8197;eV of Pd1/PIPs for the rate&#8208;determining step. The synergetic effect between neighboring single sites Pd1 and Ru1 not only enhanced the overall activity, but also stabilized PdII active sites. The discovery of synergetic effects between single sites can deepen our understanding of single&#8208;site catalysts at the molecular level.

The anion&#8208;solvent interactions in Li&#8208;ion batteries were promoted in ether&#8208;based electrolyte by applying the small&#8208;anion&#8208;size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with high dipole moment to dielectric constant ratio. The designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte showed optimized interphasial stability on the pure&#8208;SiOx anode and NMC811 cathode, thus enabling stable cycling performance of the pure&#8208;SiOx||NMC811 full cell over 500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Ether solvents with superior reductive stability promise excellent interphasial stability with high&#8208;capacity anodes while the limited oxidative resistance hinders their high&#8208;voltage operation. Extending the intrinsic electrochemical stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes to construct stable&#8208;cycling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is challenging but rewarding. Herein, the anion&#8208;solvent interactions were concerned as the key point to optimize the anodic stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes and an optimized interphase was realized on both pure&#8208;SiOx anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes. Specifically, the small&#8208;anion&#8208;size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with high dipole moment to dielectric constant ratio realized strengthened anion&#8208;solvent interactions, which enhance the oxidative stability of the electrolyte. The designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte enabled a stable cycling performance over 500&#8197;cycles in pure&#8208;SiOx||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell, demonstrating its superior practical prospects. This work provides new insight into the design of new electrolytes for emerging high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries through the regulation of interactions between species in electrolytes.

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry is an environmentally benign approach to chemical processes, which has steadily gained momentum at both laboratory and preparative scales. However, mechanochemical methods are still in their infancy compared to conventional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Our Minireview highlights a series of scaled&#8208;up mechanochemical processes that aim to encourage further developments in implementing mechanochemistry for commercial and industrial use.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has steadily showcased examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both the laboratory and the preparative scale. In contrast to solution&#8208;based chemistry, mechanochemical processes have not yet been standardized, and thus scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this Minireview is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.

         <title>Sustainable and High&#8208;Rate Electrosynthesis of Nitrogen Fertilizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis emerges as an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas (CO2) and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers. We demonstrate an organic Cu&#8208;based salphen complex as an economic catalyst for efficient production of urea and ammonia. The improved performance by tuning functionalization of molecules provides an efficient and simple strategy for design of future electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The conventional industrial production of nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers, such as urea and ammonia, relies heavily on energy&#8208;intensive processes, accounting for approximately 3&#8201;% of global annual CO2 emissions. Herein, we report a sustainable electrocatalytic approach that realizes direct and selective synthesis of urea and ammonia from co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrates under ambient conditions. With the assistance of a copper (Cu)&#8208;based salphen organic catalyst, outstanding urea (3.64&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) and ammonia (9.73&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) yield rates are achieved, in addition to a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 57.9&#177;3&#8201;% for the former. This work proposes an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers.

         <title>Size&#8208; and Emission&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Full&#8208;Color Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Tryptophan Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nanoscaled luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (nano&#8208;LMOFs) with organic linker&#8208;based emission to explore their applications in sensing, bioimaging and photocatalysis is of great interest as material size and emission wavelength both have remarkable influence on their performances. However, there is lack of platforms that can systematically tune the emission and size of nano&#8208;LMOFs with customized linker design. Herein two series of fcu&#8208; and csq&#8208;type nano&#8208;LMOFs, with precise size control in a broad range and emission colors from blue to near&#8208;infrared, were prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative based ditopic&#8208; and tetratopic carboxylic acids as the emission sources. The modification of tetratopic carboxylic acids using OH and NH2 as the substituent groups not only induces significant emission bathochromic shift of the resultant MOFs, but also endows interesting features for their potential applications. As one example, we show that the non&#8208;substituted and NH2&#8208;substituted nano&#8208;LMOFs exhibit turn&#8208;off and turn&#8208;on responses for highly selective and sensitive detection of tryptophan over other nineteen natural amino acids. This work sheds light on the rational construction of nano&#8208;LMOFs with specific emission behaviours and sizes, which will undoubtedly facilitate their applications in related areas.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent thermometry allows the remote detection of the temperature and holds great potential in future technological applications in which conventional systems could not operate. Complementary approaches to measuring the temperature aiming to enhance the thermal sensitivity would however represent a decisive step forward. For the first time, we demonstrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that luminescence thermometry could be associated with a complementary temperature readout related to a different property. Namely, we propose to take advantage of the temperature dependence of both magnetic (canonical susceptibility and relaxation time) and luminescence features (emission intensity) found in Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets (SMM) to develop original dual magneto&#8208;optical molecular thermometers allowing to overcome the contradiction between high&#8208;performance SMM and Boltzmann&#8208;type luminescence thermometry. We highlight this integrative approach to concurrent luminescent and magnetic thermometry using an air&#8208;stable benchmark SMM [Dy(bbpen)Cl] (H2bbpen = N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethyl&#8208;enediamine)) exhibiting Dy3+ luminescence. The synergy between multiparametric magneto&#8208;optical readouts and multiple linear regression makes possible a 10&#8208;fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometers over the whole temperature range, compared with the values obtained with the single optical or magnetic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Catalyzed by Cobalt Porphyrin Organic Cages for Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#713;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable approach for denitrification to balance global nitrogen cycles and an alternative to traditional thermal Haber&#8208;Bosch processes. Here, we present a supramolecular strategy for promoting NH3 production in water from NO3RR by integrating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular cobalt porphyrin (CoTPP) units into a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous organic cage architecture. The porphyrin box CoPB&#8208;C8 enhances electrochemical active site exposure, facilitates substrate&#8208;catalyst interactions, and improves catalyst stability, leading to turnover numbers and frequencies for NH3 production exceeding 200,000 and 56 s&#8208;1, respectively. These values represent a 15&#8208;fold increase in NO3RR activity and 200&#8208;mV improvement in overpotential for the 3D CoPB&#8208;C8 box structure compared to its 2D CoTPP counterpart. Synthetic tuning of peripheral alkyl substituents highlights the importance of supramolecular porosity and cavity size on electrochemical NO3RR activity. These findings establish the incorporation of 2D molecular units into 3D confined space microenvironments as an effective supramolecular design strategy for enhancing electrocatalysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#713;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable approach for denitrification to balance global nitrogen cycles and an alternative to traditional thermal Haber-Bosch processes. Here, we present a supramolecular strategy for promoting NH3 production in water from NO3RR by integrating two-dimensional (2D) molecular cobalt porphyrin (CoTPP) units into a three-dimensional (3D) porous organic cage architecture. The porphyrin box CoPB-C8 enhances electrochemical active site exposure, facilitates substrate-catalyst interactions, and improves catalyst stability, leading to turnover numbers and frequencies for NH3 production exceeding 200,000 and 56 s-1, respectively. These values represent a 15-fold increase in NO3RR activity and 200-mV improvement in overpotential for the 3D CoPB-C8 box structure compared to its 2D CoTPP counterpart. Synthetic tuning of peripheral alkyl substituents highlights the importance of supramolecular porosity and cavity size on electrochemical NO3RR activity. These findings establish the incorporation of 2D molecular units into 3D confined space microenvironments as an effective supramolecular design strategy for enhancing electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions Enforce Conformation in Switchable and Water&#8208;Soluble Diketopiperazine&#8208;Pyridine Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reach their potential as mimics of the dynamic molecules present in biological systems, foldamers must be designed to display stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. Here we report such a foldamer architecture based on alternating pyridine&#8208;diketopiperazine linkers. Epimerization is conveniently prevented through a copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling protocol. The compounds&#8217; native unswitched conformation is first discovered in the solid and solution state. The foldamers can be solubilized in DMSO and pH 9.5 buffer, retaining conformational control to a large degree. Lastly, dynamic switching is demonstrated through treatment with acid, leading to behaviour we describe as stimulus&#8208;responsive sidechain reconfiguration.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Catalyzed by Diboronate Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of easily synthesized, air and moisture stable compounds called bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDB) is reported. Under Lewis acid activation, they can catalyze highly exo&#8208;selective and enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. For diactivated dienophiles, BPDB can also selectively activate one of the two carbonyl groups based on steric effect, resulting in highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective catalytic system for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions was developed based on the newly discovered bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDB). Activated by various Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids, BPDB can catalyze highly stereoselective asymmetric exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of monocarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles. When 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles are used, the catalyst can sterically distinguish between the two binding sites, which leads to highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. BPDB can be prepared as crystalline solids on a large scale and are stable under ambient condition. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the structure for acid&#8208;activated BPDB indicated that its activation involves cleavage of a labile B&#8592;N bond.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Phase Reconstruction Enables Robust Zinc Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are inherently safe, but the severe dendrite growth and corrosion reaction on zinc anodes greatly hinder their practical applications. Most of the strategies for zinc anode modification refer to the research of lithium metal anodes on surface regulation without considering the intrinsic mechanisms of zinc anode. Herein, we first point out that surface modification cannot permanently protect zinc anodes due to the unavoidable surface damage during the stripping process by solid&#8208;liquid conversion. A bulk&#8208;phase reconstruction strategy is proposed to introduce abundant zincophilic sites both on the surface and inside the commercial zinc foils. The bulk&#8208;phase reconstructed zinc foil anodes exhibit uniform surfaces with high zincophilicity even after deep stripping, significantly improving the resistance to dendrite growth and side reactions. Our proposed strategy suggests a promising direction for the development of dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes for practical rechargeable batteries with high sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Emodin&#8208;Based Nanoarchitectonics with Giant Two&#8208;Photon Absorption for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emodin&#8208;based nanoparticles (E/H NPs) are fabricated by the co&#8208;assembly of Emo and HSA. E/H NPs possess a super&#8208;large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC) and ideal singlet oxygen (1O2) generation capability. They can be easily internalized by tumors and exhibit outstanding anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at ultra&#8208;low dosages.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited photodynamic therapy (TPE&#8208;PDT) has significant advantages over conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, obtaining easily accessible TPE photosensitizers (PSs) with high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that emodin (Emo), a natural anthraquinone (NA) derivative, is a promising TPE PS with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC: 380.9&#8197;GM) and high singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (31.9&#8201;%). When co&#8208;assembled with human serum albumin (HSA), the formed Emo/HSA nanoparticles (E/H NPs) possess a giant TPAC (4.02&#215;107&#8197;GM) and desirable 1O2 generation capability, thus showing outstanding TPE&#8208;PDT properties against cancer cells. In vivo experiments reveal that E/H NPs exhibit improved retention time in tumors and can ablate tumors at an ultra&#8208;low dosage (0.2&#8197;mg/kg) under an 800&#8197;nm femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation. This work is beneficial for the use of natural extracts NAs for high&#8208;efficiency TPE&#8208;PDT.

         <title>Monodisperse Adducts&#8208;Induced Homogeneous Nucleation Towards High&#8208;Quality Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) changes the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct and constructs a well&#8208;dispersed Sn&#8208;based precursor solution, which facilitates uniform distribution of nucleation sites and delays crystallization process, resulting in dense and uniform Sn&#8208;based perovskite films over large area. Ultimately, HMPA&#8208;incorporated device delivers a superior efficiency of 13.46&#8201;%.







Abstract
The classic solvent system can't sufficiently separate one&#8208;dimensional edge&#8208;sharing SnI2 crystals in solution, which severely restricts the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;based perovskite film. Herein, a strong Lewis base (hexamethylphosphoramide, HMPA) has been introduced to coordinate Sn2+ to modulate solvation behaviours on perovskite precursor and regulate crystallization kinetics. The large molecular volume of HMPA and stronger bind energy of SnI2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HMPA (&#8722;0.595&#8197;eV vs &#8722;0.118&#8197;eV for SnI2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMSO) change the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct, which contributes to uniform nucleation sites and prolongs crystal growth process. Delightfully, a fully&#8208;covered perovskite film is formed on the large&#8208;area substrate and tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells processed with HMPA exhibit an excellent efficiency of 13.46&#8201;%. This research provides novel insights and directions for the solution preparation of smooth and uniform large&#8208;area tin&#8208;based perovskite film.

         <title>Cross Relaxation Channel Tailored Temperature Response in Er3+&#8208;rich Upconversion Nanophosphor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An over 100 folds enhancement of upconversion emission is achieved in cryogenic Er3+&#8208;rich nanosystems. The temperature role in such increment is quantitatively revealed, which obeys an exponential relationship.







Abstract
Recently high doping of lanthanide ions (till 100&#8201;%) is realized unprecedentedly in nanostructured upconversion (UC) phosphors. However, oddly enough, this significant breakthrough did not result in a corresponding UC enhancement at ambient temperature, which hinders the otherwise very interesting applications of these materials in various fields. In this work, taking the Er3+&#8208;rich UC nanosystem as an example, we confirm unambiguously that the phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation (CR) is the culprit. More importantly, combining the theoretical modeling and experiments, the precise roles of different CR channels on UC energy loss are quantitatively revealed. As a result, lowering the temperature can exponentially enhance the relevant UC luminescence by more than two orders of magnitude. Our comprehension will play an important role in promoting the UC performance and further application of high doping rare earth materials. As a proof of concept, an Er3+&#8208;rich core/multi&#8208;shell nanophosphor is exploited which demonstrates the great potential of our finding in the field of ultra&#8208;sensitive temperature sensing.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by 8&#8208;Connected Quadrangular Prism Ligands for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two bcu Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2, have been built from 8&#8208;connected (8&#8208;c) cubic Zr6O4(OH)4(H2O)8 clusters and 8&#8208;c peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands. Impressively, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits promising application in water harvesting from air with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83&#8197;gH2O&#8201;gMOF&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.90 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles.







Abstract
Utilization of rigid, highly connected organic linkers is critical for the reticular synthesis of functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, highly&#8208;stable MOFs (e.g. Al/Cr/Zr&#8208;based MOFs) based on rigid ligands with more than 6 coordinating functions have been rarely achieved thus far. Herein, we describe the construction of two bcu Zr&#8208;based MOFs (named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2) from peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands (H8PEP&#8208;1 and H8PEP&#8208;2) with rigid quadrangular prism shape possessing 8 carboxylic groups at the prism vertices. Particularly, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits microporous structure with large Bruno&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area and high water stability, endowing it a promising water harvesting material with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83&#8197;gH2O&#8201;gMOF&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.90 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Moreover, self&#8208;consistent charge density functional tight&#8208;binding calculations were carried out, rationalizing the water adsorbing process and amount in ZrMOF&#8208;1.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher&#8208;Order Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulted asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures. Different from traditional cyclic D,L peptides, the formation of 4&#8208;imidazolidinone promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. Analysis of the nanostructures confirmed the left&#8208;handedness, representing chirality induced self&#8208;assembly. These prove that a rationally designed peptide can mimic multiple natural phenomena and could promote the development of functional biomaterials, catalysts, antibiotics, and supermolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Metal Redox Potentials to Co(III)K(I) Catalyst Performances in Carbon Dioxide and Propene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide copolymerization is a front&#8208;runner CO2 utilization strategy but its viability depends on improving the catalysis. So far, catalyst structure&#8208;performance correlations have not been straightforward, limiting the ability to predict how to improve both catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a simple measure of a catalyst ground&#8208;state parameter, metal reduction potential, directly correlates with both polymerization activity and selectivity. It is applied to compare performances of 6 new heterodinuclear Co(III)K(I) catalysts for propene oxide (PO)/CO2 ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) producing poly(propene carbonate) (PPC). The best catalyst shows an excellent turnover frequency of 389 h&#8208;1 and high PPC selectivity of &gt;99% (50 &#176;C, 20 bar, 0.025 mol% catalyst). As demonstration of its utility, neither DFT calculations nor ligand Hammett parameter analyses are viable predictors. It is proposed that the cobalt redox potential informs upon the active site electron density with a more electron rich cobalt centre showing better performances. The method may be widely applicable and is recommended to guide future catalyst discovery for other (co)polymerizations and carbon dioxide utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrolysis of Biaryl Oxazepines for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryl Amino Phenol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed (dynamic) kinetic ring&#8208;opening of biaryl oxazepines with water has been disclosed. A wide range of biaryl oxazepine substrates underwent this catalytic asymmetric hydrolysis reaction in a highly enantioselective manner. Key parameters for the success of this reaction are the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions.







Abstract
The development of catalytic asymmetric reaction with water as the reactant is challenging due to the reactivity&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#8208;control issues resulted from the low nucleophilicity and the small size of water. We disclose herein a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of biaryl oxazepines with water. A series of biaryl oxazepines undergo the CPA catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis in a highly enantioselective manner. The key for the success of this reaction is the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution pathway and the CPA catalyzed addition of water to the imine group is both enantio&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining.

         <title>Cl2&#8226;&#8722; Mediates Direct and Selective Conversion of Inert C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds into Aldehydes/Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new reactive pathway to activate inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds for valuable oxygenated products remains a great challenge. We prepared a series of covalent triazine polymers to photoactivate C&#8208;H into aldehyde/ketone via O2 &#8594;H2O2 &#8594;&#8226;OH&#8594;&#8226;Cl&#8594;Cl2&#8226;&#8722;. Experiment results showed Cl2&#8226;&#8722; could successively activate C(sp3)&#8208;H more effectively than Cl&#8226; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily compared with typical stable dichlorinated complex, avoiding chlorinated by&#8208;products generation. Moreover, an integrated two&#8208;phase system in acid solution strengthened the Cl2&#8226;&#8722; mediated process and inhibited products overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94 mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA) Syntheses in Non&#8208;Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful and highly versatile technique for the rational synthesis of colloidal dispersions of diblock copolymer nanoparticles, including spheres, worms or vesicles. PISA can be conducted in water, polar solvents or non&#8208;polar media. In principle, the latter formulations offer a wide range of potential commercial applications. However, there has been just one review focused on PISA syntheses in non&#8208;polar media and this prior article was published in 2016. The purpose of the current review article is to summarize the various advances that have been reported since then. In particular, PISA syntheses conducted using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various n&#8208;alkanes, poly(&#945;&#8208;olefins), mineral oil, low&#8208;viscosity silicone oils or supercritical CO2 are discussed in detail. Selected formulations exhibit thermally&#8208;induced worm&#8208;to&#8208;sphere or vesicle&#8208;to&#8208;worm morphological transitions and the rheological properties of various examples of worm gels in non&#8208;polar media are summarized.

PISA can be conducted in water, polar solvents or non-polar media. In principle, the latter formulations offer a wide range of potential commercial applications. However, there has been just one review focused on PISA syntheses in non-polar media and this prior article was published in 2016. The purpose of the current review article is to summarize the various advances that have been reported since then. In particular, PISA syntheses conducted using reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various n-alkanes, poly(&#945;-olefins), mineral oil, low-viscosity silicone oils or supercritical CO2 are discussed in detail. Selected formulations exhibit thermally-induced worm-to-sphere or vesicle-to-worm morphological transitions and the rheological properties of various examples of worm gels in non-polar media are summarized. Finally, visible absorption spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) enable in situ monitoring of nanoparticle formation while small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used to examine micelle fusion/fission and chain exchange mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wagner&#8211;Meerwein Rearrangements with Concomitant Nucleophilic Hydrofluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement of gem&#8208;disubstituted allylarenes that generates fluoroalkane products with isolated yields up to 84%. Modification of the counteranion of the N&#8208;fluoropyridinium oxidant suggests the substrates undergo nucleophilic fluorination during the reaction. Subjecting the substrates to other known metal&#8208;mediated hydrofluorination procedures did not lead to observable 1,2&#8208;aryl migration. Thus, indicating the unique ability of these cobalt&#8208;catalyzed conditions to generate a sufficiently reactive electrophilic intermediate capable of promoting this Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraazacoronenes and Their Dimers, Trimers and Tetramers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraazacoronenes were synthesized from bay&#8208;functionalized tetraazaperylenes via Zr&#8208;mediated cyclization and four&#8208;fold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling. In the Zr&#8208;mediated approach, an &#951;4&#8208;cyclobutadiene&#8208;zirconium(IV) complex was isolated as intermediate to cyclobutene&#8208;annulated derivatives. Using bis(pinacolatoboryl)vinyl)trimethylsilane as an C2 building block gave the tetraazacoronene target compound along with the condensed azacoronene dimer as well as higher oligomers. The series of extended azacoronenes show highly resolved UV/Vis absorption bands with increasing extinction coefficients for the extended aromatic cores and fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80% at 659&#160;nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Ion Conductor with Weakened Li Ion Solvation Enables Room Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improved durability, enhanced interfacial stability, and room temperature applicability are desirable properties for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs), yet these desired properties are rarely achieved simultaneously. Here, in this work, it is noticed that the huge resistance at Li metal/electrolyte interface dominantly impeded the normal cycling of ASSLMBs especially at around room temperature (&#65308;30 &#8451;). Accordingly, a supramolecular polymer ion conductor (SPC) with &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ was prepared. Benefiting from the halogen&#8208;bonding interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient iodine atom (on 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene) and electron&#8208;rich oxygen atoms (on ethylene oxide), the O&#8208;Li+ coordination was significantly weakened. Therefore, the SPC achieves rapid Li+ transport with high Li+ transference number, and importantly, derives a unique Li2O&#8208;rich SEI with low interfacial resistance on lithium metal surface, therefore enabling stable cycling of ASSLMBs even down to 10 &#176;C. This work is a new exploration of halogen&#8208;bonding chemistry in solid polymer electrolyte and highlights the importance of &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ in the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for room temperature ASSLMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Fe Cationic Vacancies with Graphdiyne to Enhance Exceptional Pseudocapacitive Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the electronic structure of electrode materials at atomic level is the key to controlling electrodes with outstanding rate capability. On the basis of modulating the electronic structure of materials, we proposed the design idea of graphdiyne/ferroferric oxide heterostructure (IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO) and controllable preparation of anode materials containing Fe Cationic vacancies. The goal is to motivate lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) toward ultra&#8208;high capacity, superior cyclic stability, and excellent rate performance. The graphdiyne is used as carriers to disperse Fe3O4 uniformly without agglomeration and induce high valence of Fe with reducing the energy in the system. The presence of Fe vacancy could regulate the charge distribution around vacancies and adjacent atoms, leading to facilitate electronic transportation, enlarge the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and decrease Li+ diffusion barriers, and thus displaying significant pseudocapacitive process and advantageous lithium&#8208;ion storage. The optimized electrode IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO reveals a capacity of 2084.1mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, superior cycle stability and rate performance with a high specific capacity of 1057.4 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 10C.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;derived Fluorinated Secondary Interphase for Reversible Zn&#8208;graphite Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The irreversibility of anion intercalation&#8208;deintercalation is a fundamental issue in determining the cycling stability of a dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB). In this work, we demonstrate that using a partially fluorinated carbonate solvent can drive a beneficial fluorinated secondary interphase layer formation. Such layer facilitates reversible anion (de&#8208;)intercalation processes by impeding solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation and the associated graphite exfoliation. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB &#8211; a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% after 800 cycles, with an attractive discharge capacity of 156 mAh g&#8208;1 and a mid&#8208;point discharge voltage of &#8776;1.7 V (at 0.1 A g&#8208;1). In addition, the formed fluorinated secondary interphase suppresses the self&#8208;discharge behavior by preserving 29 times of the capacity retention rate after standing for 24 hours, compared to the battery with a commonly used carbonate solvent. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for addressing the critical challenges in graphite&#8208;based DIBs and contributes to fundamental understanding to help accelerate their practical application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A ferrocene&#8208;based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well&#8208;defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multi&#8208;ferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron accepting molecules in water. As a result, unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, displaying relatively wide absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;&#160;= 650&#8208;1350 nm), are observed upon encapsulation of acceptors (i.e., chloranil and TCNQ). The resultant encapsulation&#8208;induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthening Aqueous Electrolytes without Strengthening Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous electrolytes typically suffer from poor electrochemical stability; however, eutectic aqueous solutions&#8212;25 wt.% and 62 wt.% H3PO4&#8212;cooled to &#8211;78 &#176;C exhibit significantly widened stability window. Integrated experimental and simulation results reveal that, upon cooling, Li+ ions become less hydrated and pair up with Cl&#8211;, ice&#8208;like water clusters form, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8211; bonding strengthens. Surprisingly, this low&#8208;temperature solvation structure does not strengthen water molecules&#8217; O&#8211;H bond, bucking the conventional wisdom that increasing water&#8217;s stability requires stiffening the O&#8211;H covalent bond. We propose a more general mechanism for water&#8217;s low temperature inertness in the electrolyte: less favorable solvation of OH&#8211; and H+, the byproducts of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. To showcase this stability, we demonstrate an aqueous Li&#8208;ion battery using LiMn2O4 cathode and CuSe anode with a high energy density of 109 Wh/kg. These results highlight the potential of aqueous batteries for polar and extraterrestrial missions.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding Protein Dynamics in Cells Using Chemical Cross&#8208;Linking and Hierarchical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein dynamics play a crucial role in their diverse functions. The intracellular environment significantly influences protein dynamics, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To comprehensively capture structural information from various proteins wihtin cells and characterize protein dynamics, chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry was employed. In this study, we introduce a hierarchical decoding strategy that enables the investigation of protein dynamics in vivo. Computational analysis based on distance restraints derived from cross&#8208;links is used to infer protein dynamics in cells. To facilitate this analysis, we leverage the prior structure obtained from AlphaFold2. By employing this strategy, we can characterize the full&#8208;length structure of multi&#8208;domain proteins taking into account their distinct dynamic features. Furthermore, by combining restraint sampling with an unbiased sampling and evaluation approach, we can provide a comprehensive description of the intrinsic motion of IDPs. Consequently, the hierarchical strategy we propose holds significant potential in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that undelie protein functions in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 Clusters as Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based material catalysts have shown attractive application prospects in the 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, for the industrial synthesis of H2O2, there is still lack of Co&#8208;based catalysts with high production yield rate. Here, novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster catalysts were prepared via a mild and facile method. The catalyst exhibited remarkable H2O2 selectivity (94.2% ~ 98.2%), good stability (99% activity retention after 35 h), and ultra&#8208;high H2O2 production yield rate (5.58 mol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the H&#8208;type electrolytic cell), demonstrating its promising industrial application potential. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin&#8208;mediated Co(OH)2 electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&#8208; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Oxide Interfaces with Modified Intermediate Configurations Realizing Nearly 100% CO2 Electrocatalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via renewable electricity provides a sustainable way for producing valued chemicals, while it suffers from low activity and selectivity. Herein, we constructed a novel catalyst with unique Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8208;ZnO interfaces, undercoordinated surface sites, as well as mesoporous nanostructures. The designed Ag&#8208;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx catalyst achievesan outstanding CO2 conversion performance of a nearly 100% CO Faraday efficiency with high partial current density of 22.59 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;at &#8722;0.87 V.&#160;The electronic donation of Ag and up&#8208;shifted d&#8208;band center relative to Fermi level within MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8208;ZnO interfaces contributes the high selectivity of CO. The CO2 conversion is highly correlated with the dominated linear&#8208;bonded CO intermediate confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This work enlightens the rational design of unique metal&#8208;oxide interfaces with the regulation of MXene for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the C2&#8208;symmetric 5,6&#8208;dioxy&#8208;4,7&#8208;trans&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100% atom efficiency, good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Proton Conduction against Mechanical Stress in Flexible Free&#8208;Standing Membrane Composed of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of mechanical flexibility into proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymers (CPs) is in high demand for future protonic applications such as fuel cells and hydrogen sensors. Although such mechanical properties have been primarily investigated in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) CPs, in this study, we successfully fabricated highly flexible free&#8208;standing CP membranes with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which is beneficial for enhanced performance in the aforementioned applications. We fabricated a layered CP, Cu2(NiTCPP) (H4(H2TCPP); 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin), in which a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) square grid sheet composed of tetradentate nickel porphyrins and paddlewheel&#8208;type copper dimers was connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The mechanical flexibility was evaluated by bending and tensile tests. The flexural and Young&#8217;s moduli of the membrane were significantly higher than those of conventional Nafion membranes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the in&#8208;plane proton conductivity of the membrane was maintained even under applied bending stress. Because the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the proton&#8208;conducting pathway through the hydrogen bonding network remains intact during the bending operation, our present study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of new and advanced 2D CPs without using substrates or additional polymers for protonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Group Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (GTPISA) in Non&#8208;polar Media: An Organocatalyzed Route to Block Copolymer Nanoparticles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&gt; 50 &#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (GTPISA) in non&#8208;polar media (n&#8208;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis&#8208;benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non&#8208;polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non&#8208;soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non&#8208;polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non&#8208;polar environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation with Polyhydride Ni/Ga Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bimetallic, deca&#8208;nuclear Ni3Ga7&#8208;cluster of the formula [Ni3(GaTMP)3(&#181;2&#8208;GaTMP)3(&#181;3&#8208;GaTMP)] (1, TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl) reacts reversibly with dihydrogen under the formation of a series of (poly&#8208;)hydride clusters 2. Low&#8208;temperature 2D NMR experiments at &#8209;80 &#176;C show that 2 consist of a mixture of a di&#8208; (2Di), tetra&#8208; (2Tetra) and hexahydride species (2Hexa). The structures of 2Di and 2Tetra are assessed by a combination of 2D NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The cooperation of both metals is essential for the high hydrogen uptake of the cluster. Polyhydrides 2 are catalytically active in the semihydrogenation of 4&#8208;octyne to 4&#8208;octene with good selectivity. The example is the first of its kind and conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal / main group metal clusters to the respective solid&#8209;state phase in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;polarization schemes for improved heteronuclear transfers involving labile protons in biomolecular solution NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>INEPT&#8208;based experiments are widely used for 1H&#8208;&gt;15N transfers, but often fail when involving labile protons due to solvent exchanges. J&#8208;based cross polarization (CP) strategies offer a more efficient alternative to perform such transfers, particularly when leveraging the Hwater&#8596;&#65038;HN exchange process to boost the 1H&#8594;15N transfer process. This leveraging, however, demands the simultaneous spin&#8208;locking of both Hwater and HN protons by a strong 1H RF field, while fulfilling the [[EQUATION]]HB1,H=[[EQUATION]]NB1,N Hartmann&#8208;Hahn matching condition. Given the low value of [[EQUATION]]N/[[EQUATION]]H, however, these demands are often incompatible &#8211;particularly when experiments are executed by the power&#8208;limited cryogenic probes used in contemporary high field NMR. The present manuscript discusses CP alternatives that can alleviate this limitation, and evaluates their performance on urea, amino acids, and intrinsically disordered proteins. These alternatives include new CP variants based on frequency&#8208;swept and phase&#8208;modulated pulses, designed to simultaneously fullfil&#160;the aforementioned conflicting conditions. Their performances vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis current options are theoretically analyzed with Liouville&#8208;space simulations, and experimentally tested with double and triple resonance transfer experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorogenic DNAzyme for A Thermally Stable Protein Biomarker from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Human Bacterial Pathogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusobacterium nucleatum has been correlated to many poor human conditions including oral infections, adverse pregnancies and cancer, and thus molecular tools capable of detecting this human pathogen can be used to develop diagnostic tests for them. Using a new selection method targeting thermally stable proteins without a counter&#8208;selection step, we derived an fluorogenic RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RFD&#8208;FN1, that can be activated by a thermally stable protein target that is unique to F. nucleatum subspecies. High thermal stability of protein targets is a very desirable attribute for DNAzyme&#8208;based biosensing directly with biological samples because nucleases found inherently in these samples can be heat inactivated. We further demonstrate that RFD&#8208;FN1 can function as a fluorescent sensor in both human saliva and human stool samples. The discovery of RFD&#8208;FN1 paired with a highly thermal stable protein target presents opportunities for developing simpler diagnostic tests for this important pathogen.</dc:description>

         <title>Locating Hydrogen Positions for COF&#8208;300&#160;by Cryo&#8208;3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have wide&#8208;ranging applications, and their host&#8211;guest interactions play an essential role in the achievement of COF functions. To investigate these host&#8211;guest interactions, it is necessary to locate all atoms, especially hydrogen atoms. However, it is difficult to determine the hydrogen atomic positions in COFs because of the complexities in synthesizing high&#8208;quality large single crystals. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has unique advantages for the structural determination of nanocrystals and identification of light atoms. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that the hydrogen atoms of a COF, not only on the framework but also on the guest molecule, can be located by 3D ED using continuous precession electron diffraction tomography (cPEDT) under cryogenic conditions. The host&#8211;guest interactions were clarified with the location of the hydrogen atoms. These findings provide novel insights into the investigation of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Active Chiral Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts with Suppressed Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombination of free charges in organic semiconductors reduces the available photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;carriers and restricts photovoltaic efficiency. In this work, the chiral organic semiconductors (Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S with enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208; chiral alkyl sidechains) are designed and synthesized, which show effective aggregation&#8208;induced chirality through mainchain packing with chiral conformations in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups with tilt chirality. Based on the analysis of spin&#8208;injection, magnetic&#8208;hysteresis loop, and thermodynamics and dynamics of the excited state, we suggest that the aggregation&#8208;induced chirality can generate spin&#8208;polarization, which suppresses charge recombination and offers more available charge&#8208;carriers within Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S relative to the achiral counterpart (Y6). Then the chiral Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S show enhanced catalytic activity with optimal average hydrogen evolution rates of 205 and 217 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively, 60&#8208;70% higher than Y6, when they are employed as nanoparticle photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light, AM1.5G, 100 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Quinoidal Compounds with Good Air Stability and High Electrical Conductivity for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air stable n&#8208;type conductive molecules with high electrical conductivities and excellent device performance have important applications in organic electronics, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report three self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules, designated QnNs, with a closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone and alkyl amino chains of different lengths. The QnNs are self&#8208;doped via intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone. This process is ascertained unambiguously by experiments and theoretical calculations. The use of quinoidal structure effectively improves the self&#8208;doping level, and thus increases the electrical conductivity of self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules that achieved in a closed&#8208;shell structure from &#706; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 to &gt; 0.03 S cm&#8722;1. Besides, the closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure enables good air stability of QnNs with half&#8208;lives &gt; 73 days; and Q4N shows an electrical conductivity of 0.019 S cm&#8722;1 even after exposure to air for 120 days. When applying Q6N as the cathode interlayer in organic solar cells (OSCs), an outstanding power conversion efficiency of up to 18.2% was obtained, representing one the best results in binary OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Bis&#8208;Cyclization of Allenynes for the Synthesis of Strained and Planar Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of naphthalene&#8208;tethered allenynes gave strained fused phenanthrene derivatives. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic reaction of an alkyne with the activated allene to generate a vinyl cation intermediate, followed by arylation with a tethered naphthalene ring to form the 4H&#8208;cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene (CPP) scaffold. When using aryl&#8208;substituted substrates on the alkyne terminus, the gold&#8208;catalyzed reaction produced dibenzofluorene derivatives along with the CPP derivatives. Selective formation of CPP and dibenzofluorene derivatives depending on the reaction conditions is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Molecular Design for High&#8208;Performance Molecular Diodes Based on Pyridyl Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Better control of molecule&#8208;electrode coupling (&#915;) to minimize leakage current&#160;is an effective method to optimize the functionality of molecular diodes.&#160;Herein we embedded 5 isomers of phenypyridyl derivatives, each with an N atom placed at a different position, in two electrodes to fine&#8208;tune &#915; between self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and top electrode of EGaIn (eutectic Ga&#8208;In terminating in Ga2O3). Combined with electrical tunnelling results, characterizations of electronic structures, single&#8208;level model fitting and DFT calculation, we found that the values of &#915; of SAMs formed by these isomers could be regulated by nearly 10 times, contributing to the leakage current changing for about two orders of magnitude and switching isomers from resistors to diodes with rectification ratio (r+ = |J(+1.5 V)/J(&#8722;1.5 V)|) exceeding 200. We demonstrated that the N atom placement can be chemically engineered to tune the resistive and rectifying properties of the molecular junctions, making it possible to convert molecular resistors into rectifiers. Our study provides fundamental insights into the role of isomerism in molecular electronics and offers a new avenue for designing functional molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin: Its Generality and Novelty as an Oxaporphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin (DOP) is a novel meso&#8208;oxaporphyrin analogue and exhibits unique 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromaticity, unlike its mother congener of 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin, commonly known as its cationic iron complex called verdoheme as a key intermediate of the heme catabolism. To reveal reactivities and properties as an oxaporphyrin analogue, the oxidation reaction of tetra&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylated DOP (DOP&#8208;Ar4) was explored in this study. Stepwise oxidation from the 20&#960;&#8208;electron neutral state was achieved, and the corresponding 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation and 18&#960;&#8208;electron dication were characterized. Further oxidation of the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication resulted in the formation of a ring&#8208;opened dipyrrindione product via hydrolysis. Considering a similar reaction of verdoheme to ring&#8208;opened biliverdin in the heme degradation in nature, the current result consolidates the generality of ring&#8208;opening reactivity as an oxaporphyrinium cation species.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8208;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but great challenge is lying in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8208;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8208;N4 sites decorated nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy on nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is strongly adsorbed on Fe1 site via vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1 s&#8208;1 turnover frequency, ~100% selectivity, 24 types of substrates adaptability). Our findings not only advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations but open a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at atomic level.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) with zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8208;) as donor to form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer. Three water molecules were situated in the channels to connect with acidic species through hydrogen bonding interactions to give a 3D framework. The continuous &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions along the a axis and the smooth H&#8208;bonding chain along the b axis provide the electron and proton transfer pathways, respectively. After 405 nm light irradiation, the photogenerated radicals could simultaneously endow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36 with photoswitchable electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer. By single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient absorption spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the switchable conductivity upon irradiation has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Porous [14]Annulene Graphene Nanoribbon and a&#160;Porous [30]Annulene Graphene Nanosheet on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrical and mechanical properties of graphene&#8208;based materials can be tuned by the introduction of nanopores, which are sensitively related to the size, morphology, density, and location of nanopores. The synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional graphene nanostructures containing well&#8208;defined nonplanar nanopores has been challenging due to the intrinsic steric hindrance. Herein, we report the selective synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111), starting from a same precursor. The formation of distinct products on the two substrates originates from the different thermodynamics and kinetics of coupling reactions. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing the reaction pathways were proposed. In addition,&#160; the combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the electronic structures of porous graphene structures, demonstrating the impact of nonplanar pores on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;Based Separator with Interfacial Chemistry Regulation for Robust Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium metal batteries (KMBs) are ideal choices for high energy density storage system owing to the low electrochemical potential and low cost of K. However, the practical KMB applications suffer from intrinsically active K anode, which would bring serious safety concerns due to easier generation of dendrites. Herein, to explore a facile approach to tackle this issue, we propose to regulate K plating/stripping via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework. As a case study, the functional units of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Benefiting from these favorable features, uniform and stable K plating/stripping is realized with the regulated separator. Full battery assembled with the regulated separator showed ~19.9% higher discharge capacity than that with glass fiber separator at 20 mA g&#8208;1 and much better cycling stability at high rates. The generality of our approach is validated with KMBs using different cathodes and electrolytes. We envision that the strategy to suppress dendrite formation by commercial separator surface engineering using tailor&#8208;designed functional units can be extended to other metal/metal ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Methanobactin OB3b (Mbn&#8208;OB3b) is a unique natural product with stunning affinity for copper ions (Ka &#8776; Cu(I) 1034). Here, we report the first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;bound methanobactin&#160;OB3b featuring as key transformations a cyclodehydration&#8208;thioacylation sequence, to generate the conjugated heterocyclic systems, and a copper&#8208;templated cyclization, to complete the caged structure of the very sensitive target compound.</dc:description>
