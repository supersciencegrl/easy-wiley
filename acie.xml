      <title>Sulfur&#8208;Preloaded Double&#8208;shelled C@MoS2 Structures As an Additive Reservoir for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>The notorious growth of Li dendrites is one of the main hindrances for the practical application of the lithium metal anode (LMA). In this work,  a sulfur&#8208;preloaded hollow nanostructure based on hierarchical MoS  2  coated hollow carbon particles  (C@MoS  2  /S) was designed to modify the LMA. The C@MoS  2  hollow nanostructures serve as a good scaffold for repeated Li plating/stripping. More importantly, the encapsulated sulfur could gradually release lithium polysulfides during the Li plating/stripping processes, which act as an effective additive to promote the formation of a mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer embedded with crystalline hybrid lithium&#8208;based components. These two factors together effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites. The as&#8208;modified LMA shows a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98 % over 500 cycles at the current density of 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  . When matched with a LiFePO  4  cathode,  the assembled full cell  displays a highly improved cycle life of 300 cycles, implying the feasibility of the proposed LMA.</dc:description>

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part A. Stage Setting</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a wave breaking over us&#8212;a wave of simulation and artificial intelligence. In three reflective Essays we make a case for true understanding, for scientific story&#8208;telling, as well as a role for pleasure and the emotions within science in general and quantum chemistry in particular.







Abstract
We begin our tripartite Essay with a triangle of understanding, theory and simulation. Sketching the intimate tie between explanation and teaching, we also point to the emotional impact of understanding. As we trace the development of theory in chemistry, Dirac's characterization of what is known and what is needed for theoretical chemistry comes up, as does the role of prediction, and Thom's phrase &#8220;To predict is not to explain.&#8221; We give a typology of models, and then describe, no doubt inadequately, machine learning and neural networks. In the second part, we leave philosophy, beginning by describing Roald's being beaten by simulation. This leads us to artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens&#8217; account of what a go&#8208;playing program knows. Back to our terrain&#8212;we ask &#8220;Quantum Chemistry, &#8224; ca. 2020?&#8221; Then move to examples of AI affecting social matters, ranging from trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future a voice. But we don't do justice to that view&#8212;how could we? We return to questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. Onward: In the 3rd part of this Essay, we work our way up from pessimism. We trace (another triangle!) the special interests of experimentalists, who want the theory we love, and reliable numbers as well. We detail in our own science instances where theory gave us real joy. Two more examples&#8208;on magnetic coupling in inorganic diradicals, and the way to think about alkali metal halides, show us the way to integrate simulation with theory. Back and forth is how it should be&#8212;between painfully&#8208;obtained, intriguing numbers, begging for interpretation, in turn requiring new concepts, new models, new theoretically grounded tools of computation. Through such iterations understanding is formed. As our tripartite Essay ends, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and searchers for understanding. Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a passage to art and to perceiving, as we argue we must, the sacred in science.

      <title>Early Transition Metal Catalysis for Olefin&#8211;Polar Monomer Copolymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst design: This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations are discussed, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.







Abstract
Introducing polar functional groups into widely used polyolefins can enhance polymer surface, rheological, mixing, and other properties, potentially upgrading polyolefins for advanced, value&#8208;added applications. The metal catalyst&#8208;mediated copolymerization of non&#8208;polar olefins with polar comonomers represents the seemingly most straightforward, atom&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient approach for synthesizing polar functionalized polyolefins. However, electrophilic early transition metal (groups 3 and 4)&#8208;catalyzed processes which have achieved remarkable success in conventional olefin polymerizations, encounter severe limitations here, largely associated with the Lewis basicity of the polar co&#8208;monomers. In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.

However, electrophilic early transition metal (groups 3 and 4)&#8208;catalyzed processes which have achieved remarkable success in conventional olefin polymerizations, encounter severe limitations here, largely associated with the Lewis basicity of the polar co&#8208;monomers. In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methanol synthesis at a wide range of H2/CO2 ratios over Rh&#8208;In bimetallic catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in capturing hydrogen generated from renewables with CO  2  to produce methanol. However, renewable hydrogen production is currently expensive and in limited quantity as compared to CO  2  . Excess CO  2  and limited H  2  in the feedstock gas mixture is not favourable for the CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol reaction, which causes low activity and poor methanol selectivity.

      <title>Water&#8208;Soluble&#160;Polymers with Appending Porphyrins as Bioinspired Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular design to improve catalyst performance is significant but challenging. In enzymes, residue groups that are close to reaction centers play critical roles in regulating activities. Using this bioinspired strategy, we designed three water&#8208;soluble polymers with appending Co porphyrins and different side&#8208;chain groups to mimic enzyme reaction centers and activity&#8208;controlling residue groups, respectively. With these polymers, we achieved high hydrogen evolution efficiency in neutral aqueous media for electro&#8208; ( turnover frequency &#160;&gt; 2.3&#215;10  4  &#160;s  &#8211;1  ) and photo&#8208;catalysis (turnover number &gt; 2.7 &#215; 10  4  ). Porphyrin units are surrounded and protected by polymer chains, and more importantly, the activity can be tuned with different side&#8208;chain groups. Therefore, instead of revising molecular structures that is difficult from both design and synthesis points of view, we can use polymers to improve molecular solubility and stability and simultaneously regulate activity by using side&#8208;chain groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Oligomer as an Organic Template for Direct Synthesis of Aluminosilicate ITH Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>Despite great progress in the synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolites, there are still a large number of zeolites that could not be prepared in the aluminosilicate form. One of typical examples is ITH zeolite, where direct synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH is currently still challenging. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the successful synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH zeolite using a simple cationic oligomer as an organic template. The key to this success is that the cationic oligomer has a strong complexation ability with aluminum species combined with a structural directing ability for the ITH structure similar to that of the conventional organic template. Physicochemical analysis shows that the aluminosilicate ITH zeolite has very high crystallinity, nanosheet&#8208;like crystal morphology, large surface area, fully four&#8208;coordinated Al species, and abundant acidic sites. More importantly, methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) tests reveal that the Al&#8208;ITH zeolite shows much higher selectivity for propylene and longer lifetime than commercial ZSM&#8208;5. FCC tests show that Al&#8208;ITH zeolite is a good candidate as a shape selective FCC additive for enhancing propylene and butylene selectivity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite great progress in the synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolites, there are still a large number of zeolites that could not be prepared in the aluminosilicate form. One of typical examples is ITH zeolite, where direct synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH is currently still challenging. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the successful synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH zeolite using a simple cationic oligomer as an organic template. The key to this success is that the cationic oligomer has a strong complexation ability with aluminum species combined with a structural directing ability for the ITH structure similar to that of the conventional organic template. Physicochemical analysis shows that the aluminosilicate ITH zeolite has very high crystallinity, nanosheet&#8208;like crystal morphology, large surface area, fully four&#8208;coordinated Al species, and abundant acidic sites. More importantly, methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) tests reveal that the Al&#8208;ITH zeolite shows much higher selectivity for propylene and longer lifetime than commercial ZSM&#8208;5. FCC tests show that Al&#8208;ITH zeolite is a good candidate as a shape selective FCC additive for enhancing propylene and butylene selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Overriding Intrinsic Reactivity in Aliphatic C&#8211;H Oxidation: Preferential C3/C4 Oxidation of Aliphatic Ammonium Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H oxidation of unactivated positions in aliphatic ammonium chains poses a tremendous synthetic challenge for which a solution has not been found yet. Here, we report preferential oxidation of the strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions of aliphatic ammonium substrates by employing a novel supramolecular catalyst. This chimeric catalyst was synthesized by linking the well&#8208;explored catalytic moiety Fe(pdp) to an alkyl ammonium binding molecular tweezer. The results highlight the vast potential of overriding the intrinsic reactivity in chemical reactions by guiding catalysis using supramolecular host structures that enable a precise orientation of the substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Partially Pyrolyzed Binary Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of versatile materials for fabricating functional heterogeneous catalysts, but the most routine method is through carbonization to form porous carbon materials, which however inevitably losses their inherent MOFs characteristics. Herein, we developed a partially&#8208;controlled pyrolysis strategy to create evenly distributed NiO nanoparticles within NiFe&#8208;MOF nanosheets (MOF NSs) for electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The elemental Ni can be partially transformed to NiO and uniformly distributed on the surface of the MOF NSs, which is crucial for the formation of the particular structure. The optimized MOF NSs&#8208;300 exhibits the highest activity for ORR with near&#8208;zero overpotential and excellent H2O2 selectivity (~99%) in 0.1 M KOH solution. High&#8208;yield H2O2 production rate of 6.5 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 has also been achieved by MOF NSs&#8208;300 at 0.1 M KOH and 0.6 V (vs.RHE). In contrast to completely pyrolyzed products, the enhanced catalytic activities of partially pyrolyzed MOF NSs&#8208;300 is mainly originated from the maintained MOF structure and the newly&#8208;generated NiO nanoparticles, forming the coordinatively unsaturated Ni atoms and tuning the performance towards electrochemical H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Holey Lamellar High Entropy Oxide as Ultra&#8208;Highly Active Heterogeneous Catalyst for Solvent&#8208;free Aerobic Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol</title>
      <dc:description>The development of noble metal free heterogeneous catalysts is promising for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols; however, the relatively low conversion of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts under solvent&#8208;free atmospheric condition greatly restricts their industrial application. Herein, we design ed synthesize a novel holey lamellar high entropy oxide (HEO) Co  0.2  Ni  0.2  Cu  0.2  Mg  0.2  Zn  0.2  O material with mesoporous structure via a simple anchoring and merging process. The prepared holey lamellar HEO as heterogeneous catalyst exhibits ultra&#8208;high catalytic activity for the solvent&#8208;free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Up to 98% conversion can be achieved in only 2 hours, to our knowledge, it is the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction so far. By rational regulating the catalytic reaction parameters, benzoic acid or benzaldehyde can be selectively optimized as the main product.

      <title>Covalent Assembly of MoS2 Nanosheets with SnS Nanodots as Linkages for Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Weak Van der Waals&#8217; interactions between interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional layered materials have rendered intrinsic problems of disabled across&#8208;interlayer electron transfer and poor layered structural stability, seriously deteriorating their performance in energy applications.

The covalent assembly based on all&#8208;inorganic and carbon&#8208;free concept enables effective across&#8208;interlayer electron transfer, facilitated ion diffusion kinetics and outstanding mechanical stability, which are evidenced by substantial characterizations, density functional theory calculations and mechanical simulations. Consequently, the MoS  2  /SnS HSs exhibit superb rate performance and long cycling stability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, representing the best comprehensive performance in carbon&#8208;free MoS  2  &#8208;based anodes to date. Moreover, the MoS  2  /SnS HSs also show excellent sodium storage performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The proposed strategy provides an effective solution to the intrinsic problems of 2D layered materials for energy applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystal Engineering of Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Organic Solids</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular packing of organic luminogens governs their photophysical behavior. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913393), E. Hamzehpoor and D.&#8197;F. Perepichka report a series of highly emissive azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) solids whose luminescent properties are controlled by the size of substituents. The co&#8208;alignment of carbonyl groups in sterically unencumbered TANGO derivatives leads to room temperature phosphorescence (triplet emission) with quantum yields up to 42&#8201;%, while the &#8776;60&#176; rotation due to bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups results in an almost pure fluorescence.

      <title>Application and Structural Analysis of Triazole&#8208;Bridged Disulfide Mimetics in Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>
1,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles can be used to mimic disulfide bonds and overcome their redox instability. As T. Durek, D.&#8197;J. Craik, and co&#8208;workers show in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003435), the triazole motif can be incorporated into backbone cyclic peptides based on the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 scaffold. NMR and X&#8208;ray structural analyses show that the triazole linkage has exceptional mimicry, whilst maintaining activity and improving metabolic stability compared to its disulfide counterpart.

      <dc:description>
A photoactivatable prodrug approach overcomes the deactivation of drugs based on gold complexes caused by off&#8208;target binding to serum albumin. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000528), T. Zou et&#8197;al. show that gold(III) hydride complexes are inert towards serum albumin in the dark. Once they enter tumor tissues, their thiol reactivity can be photochemically activated, thereby leading to potent inhibition of tumor thiol enzymes through the formation of Au&#8722;S bonds.

      <dc:description>Herein we present a new kind of elastic metal&#8208;organic materials (MOMs) that are capable of multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness based on dual stress and thermally responsive triple&#8208;helix coordination polymers. The strong metal&#8208;coordination linkage in combination with the flexibility of organic linkers in these MOMs, &#160;rather than the &#8216;4 &#197;&#8217; stacking interactions observed in organic crystals, renders the helical chain to be act like a molecular spring and thus accounts for their intriguing macroscopic elasticity. Moreover, the thermosalient effect of elastic MOMs is reported for the first time here. Crystal structure analyses at different temperatures reveal that this thermo&#8208;responsiveness is achieved through adaptive regulation of the triple&#8208;helix chains via fine&#8208;tuning of opening angle of flexible 'V'&#8208;shaped organic linkers as well as rotation of its lateral conjugated groups so as to resist the possible expansion, thus demonstrating the vital role of adaptive reorganization of triple&#8208;helix metal&#8208;organic chain as a molecular spring&#8208;like motif in crystal jumping.</dc:description>

      <title>Three&#8208;step Spin State Transition and Hysteretic Proton Transfer in the Crystal of an Iron(II) Hydrazone Complex</title>
      <dc:description>A proton&#8211;electron coupling system, exhibiting unique bistability or multistability of the protonated state, is an attractive target for developing new switchable materials on the basis of proton dynamics. In this paper, we present an iron(II) hydrazone crystalline compound, which displays the stepwise transition and bistability of proton transfer at the crystal level. These phenomena are realized through the coupling with spin transition. Although the multi&#8208;step transition with hysteresis has been observed in various systems (e.g., valence tautomerism), the corresponding behavior of proton transfer has not been reported in crystalline systems; thus, the described iron(II) complex is the first example. Furthermore, because proton transfer occurs only in one of the two ligands and p electrons redistribute in it, the dipole moment of the iron(II) complexes changes with the proton transfer, wherein the total dipole moment in the crystal was canceled out owing to the antiferroelectric&#8208;like arrangement. This study shows the potential for using the proton transfer phenomenon in the materials science field.</dc:description>

      <title>Revisiting the Polymerization of Diphenylacetylenes with Tungsten(VI) Chloride and Tetraphenyltin: An Alternative Mechanism by a Metathesis Catalytic System</title>
      <dc:description>An alternative reaction mechanism of the polymerization of diphenylacetylelnes using a catalytic system composed of tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin has been proposed through the optimization of reaction conditions and investigation of the effect of the electronic nature of diphenylacetylene monomers on the polymerizability. The detailed structures of the polymers have been suggested by mass spectrometric analysis of the obtained polymers and oligomers, which suggested that a phenyl group of tetraphenyltin has been introduced to an initiating end of the polymer chain. Mass spectrometric analysis also provided information about the termination processes of the polymerization. The experimental results strongly suggested that the polymerization of diphenylacetylenes using tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin proceeds through a migratory insertion mechanism rather than the long&#8208;accepted metathesis mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic, Enantioselective Sulfenofunctionalization of Alkenes&#8212; Development and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>The last decade has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for the enantioselective vicinal difunctionalization of alkenes initiated by electrophilic sulfenyl group transfer. The addition of sulfenium ions to alkenes results in the generation of chiral, non&#8208;racemic thiiranium ions. These highly reactive intermediates are susceptible to attack by a myriad of nucleophiles in a stereospecific ring&#8208;opening event to afford anti 1,2&#8208;sulfenofunctionalized products. The practical application of sulfenium ion transfer has been enabled by advances in the field of Lewis base catalysis. This Review will chronicle the initial discovery and characterization of thiiranium ion intermediates followed by the determination of their configurational stability and the challenges of developing enantioselective variants. Once the framework for the reactivity and stability of thiiranium ions has been established, a critical analysis of pioneering studies will be presented.

They also display characteristic absorption and emission spectra of perylene dyes. ZY&#8208;01 and ZY&#8208;02 with a nearly planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton exhibit amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. All solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers have been fabricated using ZY&#8208;01 and ZY&#8208;02 as active gain materials, both showing narrow emission linewidth (&lt; 0.4 nm) at wavelengths around 515 and 570 nm, respectively. On the other hand, ZY&#8208;03 did not show ASE and lasing, presumably due to its highly twisted backbone, which facilitates non&#8208;radiative internal conversion and intersystem crossing.</dc:description>

      <title>A Novel Side&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Elastomer Exhibiting Anomalous&#160;Reversible Shape Change</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been actively investigated as stimuli&#8208;controlled actuators and soft robots. The basis of these applications is the ability of LCEs to undergo a reversible shape change upon a liquid crystalline (LC)&#8208;isotropic phase transition. When a mechanically stretched LCE strip with uniaxially aligned mesogens (i.e., monodomain) is heated into the isotropic phase, it contracts in length and elongates in width, while the opposite change occurs on cooling the strip back to the LC phase. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel LCE based on a side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) and the finding of a unique property of the polymer. In contrast to known LCEs, this LCE exhibits a striking&#160;anomalous&#160;shape change. Subjecting a mechanically stretched monodomain strip to LC&#8208;disorder phase transition, both the length and width of the strip contract in isotropic phase, and both elongate in LC phase. We show that this thermally induced peculiar&#160;behaviour is the result of a subtle interplay between the relaxation of polymer main chain oriented along the stretching direction and the disordering of side&#8208;group mesogens oriented perpendicularly to the stretching direction. This finding points out potential design of LCEs of this peculiar type and possible applications to exploit.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultramicropore engineering by dehydration to enable molecular sieving of H2 by calcium trimesate</title>
      <dc:description>The high energy footprint of commodity gas purification and ever&#8208;increasing demand for gases require new approaches to gas separation. Kinetic separation of gas mixtures through molecular sieving can enable &#8220;ideal&#8221; separation through molecular size or shape exclusion. Physisorbents must exhibit just the right pore diameter to enable such ideal separation, but the 0.3&#8208;0.4 nm range relevant to small gas molecules is hard to control with precision. Herein, we report that dehydration of the ultramicroporous metal&#8208;organic framework Ca&#8208;trimesate, Ca(HBTC) . H2O (H3BTC = trimesic acid), bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca&#8208;H2O, affords a narrow pore variant, Ca(HBTC), bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca. Whereas bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca&#8208;H2O (pore diameter 0.34 nm) exhibits ultra&#8208;high CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 and C2H2/C2H4 binary selectivities, bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca (pore diameter 0.31 nm) offers ideal selectivities for H 2 /CO 2  and H2/N2 under cryogenic conditions. Ca&#8208;trimesate, the first physisorbent to exhibit H2 sieving under cryogenic conditions, could be prototypal for a potentially general approach to exert precise control over pore diameter in physisorbents.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high energy footprint of commodity gas purification and ever&#8208;increasing demand for gases require new approaches to gas separation. Kinetic separation of gas mixtures through molecular sieving can enable &#8220;ideal&#8221; separation through molecular size or shape exclusion. Physisorbents must exhibit just the right pore diameter to enable such ideal separation, but the 0.3&#8208;0.4 nm range relevant to small gas molecules is hard to control with precision. Herein, we report that dehydration of the ultramicroporous metal&#8208;organic framework Ca&#8208;trimesate, Ca(HBTC) . H2O (H3BTC = trimesic acid), bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca&#8208;H2O, affords a narrow pore variant, Ca(HBTC), bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca. Whereas bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca&#8208;H2O (pore diameter 0.34 nm) exhibits ultra&#8208;high CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 and C2H2/C2H4 binary selectivities, bnn&#8208;1&#8208;Ca (pore diameter 0.31 nm) offers ideal selectivities for H 2 /CO 2  and H2/N2 under cryogenic conditions. Ca&#8208;trimesate, the first physisorbent to exhibit H2 sieving under cryogenic conditions, could be prototypal for a potentially general approach to exert precise control over pore diameter in physisorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Frameworks via Hydrophobic Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>The development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability is of critical importance for their practical uses. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the stability of 3D COFs can be improved by periodic decoration of isopropyl groups on their backbones. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the alkyl groups, the resultant COFs show high crystallinity, permanent pores, and exceptional stability in harsh environments, such as strong acids (3 M HCl or 3 M H2SO4 for one week), a strong base (20 M NaOH for one week) and boiling water (100 &#186;C for one month). Furthermore, these highly&#8208;stable and hydrophobic COFs display excellent oil/water separation performance with &gt; 99% separation efficiency over a wide pH range. This work demonstrates the use of alkyl decoration in 3D COFs to tune their chemical stability and expand their potential applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Deciphering the Intersystem Crossing in a Helical BODIPY for Recorded Low Dose Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Intersystem crossing (ISC) of triplet photosensitizers is a vital process for fundamental photochemistry and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the currently effective long wavelength operating photosensitizers have to rely on heavy atoms to enhance ISC. Unfortunately, the heavy atoms, besides their toxicity, can also cause significant reduction in the triplet lifetime of the photosensitizers, which is fundamentally detrimental to their applications. To overcome this challenge, herein we report the co&#8208;existence of efficient ISC and long triplet excited lifetime in a heavy atom&#8208;free Bodipy helicene molecule. Via advanced theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we confirmed the ISC of the Bodipy is resulted from its twisted molecular structure and reduced symmetry. The twisted Bodipy shows exceptionally intense long wavelength absorption (&#949; = 1.76 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  at 630 nm), satisfactory triplet quantum yield (&#934;  T  = 52%) and long&#8208;lived triplet state (&#964;  T  = 492 &#956;s), leading to unprecedented performance as a triplet photosensitizer for PDT. Moreover, nanoparticles constructed with such helical Bodipy show surprisingly efficient PDT mediated antitumor immunity amplification with ultra&#8208;low dose (0.25 &#956;g/kg body weight), which is several hundred times lower than that of the existing PDT reagents. Our study paves the way to design the next generation of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

      <title>A Diselenide turn&#8208;on Fluorescent Probe for the Detection of Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>We report the first diselenide&#8208;based probe for the selective detection of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), an enzyme commonly overexpressed in melanomas. The probe design involves conjugation of a seminaphthorhodafluor dye with a diselenide moiety. TrxR reduces the diselenide bond, triggering a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response of the probe. Kinetic studies reveal favorable binding of the probe with TrxR with a Michaelis&#8208;Menten constant (K  m  ) of 15.89 &#181;M.

Unlike most titania nanomaterials, the particles remain in anatase phase and undergo no transition to rutile phase, and also become catalytically&#8208;active reduced TiO2&#8208;x, during pyrolysis. When exposed to a slow electron beam, the nanoparticles exhibit an unprecedented charge/discharge behavior, continuously lighting up and fading away for an average period of ca. 15 s, for an extended period of time. The nanoparticles also show a 50 nm&#8208;red&#8208;shift in their UV&#8208;vis absorption and long&#8208;lived charge carriers (electrons and holes) at room temperature in the dark, even long after UV irradiation.

      <dc:description>Flexible multivalent 3&#8208;D nanosystems which can deform and adapt onto the virus surface via specific ligand&#8208;receptor multivalent interactions can efficiently block the virus adhesion onto the cell. We here report on the synthesis of a 250 nm sized flexible sialylated nanogel which adapts onto the influenza A virus (IAV) surface via multivalent binding of its sialic acid (SA) residues with hemagglutinin spike proteins on the virus surface. We could demonstrate that the high flexibility of SA residues in the flexible nanogel improves IAV inhibition by 400 times as compared to a rigid sialylated nanogel in the hemagglutination inhibition assay.

      <title>NIR&#8208;Absorbing &#960;&#8208;Extended Azulene: A Non&#8208;Alternant Isomer of Terrylene Bisimide</title>
      <dc:description>The first planar &#960;&#8208;extended azulene that retains aromaticity of odd&#8208;membered rings was synthesized by [3+3] peri&#8208;annulation of two naphthalene imides at both long&#8208;edge sides of azulene. Using bromination and subsequent nucleophilic substitution by methoxide and morpholine, selective functionalization of the &#960;&#8208;extended azulene was achieved. Whilst these new azulenes can be regarded as isomers of terrylene bisimide they exhibit entirely different properties which include very narrow optical and electrochemical gaps. DFT, TD&#8208;DFT as well as nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations were applied to explain the structural and functional properties of these new &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed planarity of reported &#960;&#8208;scaffolds and aromaticity of their azulene moiety.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;H Bond Formation at a Diiron Bridging Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>Despite their connection to ammonia synthesis, little is known about the ability of iron&#8208;bound, bridging nitrides to form N&#8211;H bonds. Herein we report a linear diiron bridging nitride complex supported by a redox&#8208;active macrocycle. The unique ability of the ligand scaffold to adapt to the geometric preference of the bridging species was found to facilitate the formation of N&#8211;H bonds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer to generate a &#181;&#8208;amide product. The structurally analogous &#181;&#8208;silyl&#8208; and &#181;&#8208;borylamide complexes were shown to form from the net insertion of the nitride into the E&#8211;H bonds (E = B, Si). Protonation of the parent bridging amide produced ammonia in high yield, and treatment of the nitride with PhSH was found to liberate NH3 in high yield through a reaction that engages the redox&#8208;activity of the ligand during PCET.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which overcomes the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem in organic optoelectronics, is revealed by monitoring the real time structural evolution and dynamics of electronic excited state with frequency and polarization resolved ultrafast ultraviolet/infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

The ultrafast excited state cyclization by crossing a conical intersection (CI) provides an efficient nonradiative relaxation pathway in solutions. Without such a reaction mechanism, the electronic excitation is preserved in the molecular solids and the molecule fluoresces efficiently, aided by the very slow intermolecular charge and energy transfers due to the well separated molecular packing arrangement in solids. The mechanisms can be general for tuning the properties of chromophores in different phases for various important applications.</dc:description>

      <title>The Enantioselective Preparation of Arenes with &#946;&#8208;Stereogenic Centers: Confronting the 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefin Problem Using CuH/Pd Cooperative Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Arenes with &#946;&#8208;stereogenic centers are important substructures in pharmaceuticals and natural products. Their synthesis traditionally involves two separate and individually challenging steps: enantioselective synthesis of a chiral main&#8208;group organometallic complex and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl electrophile. We describe the development of asymmetric anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins by dual palladium and copper hydride catalysis as a convenient and significantly more general alternative. This reaction is an efficient one&#8208;step process that addresses several limitations of the stepwise approaches. The use of cesium benzoate as a base and a common phosphine ligand for both the Cu&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalyzed processes were important discoveries that allowed these challenging olefin substrates to be efficiently transformed to products. A variety of aryl bromide coupling partners, including numerous heterocycles, were coupled with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes to generate arenes with &#946;&#8208;stereogenic centers. Finally, the effect of the level of olefin substitution on reaction yield and enantioselectivity has been investigated.</dc:description>

We investigated their electrochemical and photoelectrochemical redox processes under various pH and applied potentials, and employed them as electrocatalyst&#160;and photoanode&#160;for hydrogen production and water oxidation respectively. The catalyst remains intact for at least 100 cycles of electrochemical cycling and six hours of hydrogen production at pH 1.

      <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with strategic use of remote coordinating functional groups has received significant attentions recently in order to address the issues of both low reactivity and poor selectivity. A bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amide group is the most successfully adopted in unactivated alkenes for Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we describe the first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes bearing diverse simple functionalities with arylboronic acids. A series of &#948;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;arylated amides, ketones, pyridines, and amines was accessed with excellent regioselectivity and in high yields. Hydroalkenylation of unactivated alkenes was also proved nicely applicable under this manganese&#8208;catalysis regime. The protocol features earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalysis, easily available substrates, diverse functional group tolerance, and excellent regioselective control.</dc:description>

      <title>Fast and Stable N&#8208;Terminal Cysteine Modification via Thiazolidino Boronate Mediated Acyl Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a novel conjugation chemistry of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (NCys) that proceeds with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity, allowing facile modification of NCys&#8208;bearing proteins in complex biological milieu. This new NCys conjugation proceeds with  a thiazolidine boronate (TzB) intermediate  that results from fast (  k  2  : ~5000 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) and reversible conjugation of NCys with 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA). We have designed a FPBA derivative that upon TzB formation elicits an intramolecular acyl transfer to give N&#8208;acyl thiazolidines. In contrast to the quick hydrolysis of TzB, the N&#8208;acylated thiazolidines exhibit robust stability under physiologic conditions. The utility of the TzB mediated NCys conjugation is demonstrated by rapid and non&#8208;disruptive labeling of two enzymes. Furthermore, applying this chemistry to bacteriophage allows facile chemical modification of phage libraries, which greatly expands the chemical space amenable to phage display.</dc:description>

      <title>Precision Conjugation: An Emerging Tool for Generating Protein&#8208;Polymer Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates are increasingly applied to biomedicine due to a unique combination of the biological activity from the proteins and the multifunctionality and flexibility from the polymers. However, traditional protein&#8208;polymer conjugation techniques suffer from some unavoidable drawbacks, including non&#8208;specificity and low efficiency. In this minireview, we discuss a new approach based on &#8220;  Precision Conjugation  &#8221; to the construction of the next&#8208;generation protein&#8208;polymer conjugates in a better controlled, more efficient, and tailorable fashion for broad and advanced applications. In illustrating the concept, we highlight two general methodologies known as site&#8208;specific in situ growth (SIG) and intrinsically&#8208;disordered polypeptide fusion (IPF), with a focus on the in situ, efficient, and controllable formation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates.

      <title>Gold(I)/Gold(III) Catalysis Merging Oxidative Addition and &#960;&#8208;Alkene Activation</title>
      <dc:description>The hetero&#8208;arylation of alkenes with aryl iodides has been efficiently achieved with the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex via Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis. The possibility to combine oxidative addition of aryl iodides and &#960;&#8208;activation of alkenes at gold is demonstrated for the first time. The reaction is robust and general (&gt;30 examples including internal alkenes, 5, 6 and 7&#8208;membered rings). It is regioselective and leads exclusively to trans addition products. The (P,N) gold complex is most efficient with electron&#8208;rich aryl substrates, which are troublesome with alternative photoredox / oxidative approaches. In addition, it actuates a very unusual switch in regioselectivity from 5&#8208;exo to 6&#8208;endo cyclization between the Z and E isomers of internal alkenols.</dc:description>
