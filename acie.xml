         <title>Antibiotic&#8208;Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8220;Unclear&#8221; Infection Imaging?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides summary and critical evaluation, including the challenges and pitfalls, of antibiotic&#8208;derived positron emission tomographic radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging either considered for radiotracer development for infection imaging or radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization.







Abstract
The excellent features of non&#8208;invasive molecular imaging, its progressive technology (real&#8208;time, whole&#8208;body imaging and quantification), and global impact by a growing infrastructure for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are encouraging prospects to investigate new concepts, which could transform clinical care of complex infectious diseases. Researchers are aiming towards the extension beyond the routinely available radiopharmaceuticals and are looking for more effective tools that interact directly with causative pathogens. We reviewed and critically evaluated (challenges or pitfalls) antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging. We considered both radiotracer development for infection imaging and radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization; overall, a total of 20 original PET radiotracers derived from eleven approved antibiotics.

         <title>One and Two&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Symmetry&#8208;Reduced AIEgen&#8208;Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;reduced TPE&#8208;cored ligand was applied for the construction of MOFs with dense packing structures, which are beneficial to the improvement of one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent properties, achieving high TPA cross&#8208;sections of &#8776;3000&#8197;GM.







Abstract
By designing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based AIEgen&#8208;ligand with reduced symmetry, we obtained two alkaline&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based MOFs (LIFM&#8208;102 and LIFM&#8208;103) with dense packing structures and low porosity as proved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and CO2 sorption data. Excitingly, the desolvated MOFs with rigid environment and reduced lattice free solvent exhibit high quantum yields (QY, 64.9&#8201;% and 79.4&#8201;%) and excellent two&#8208;photon excited photoluminescence (TPA cross&#8208;sections, 2946.6&#8197;GM and 2899.0&#8197;GM), while maintaining the external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties suitable for anticounterfeit fields. The effect of ligand conformation was validated by comparing the structure and fluorescence properties of the samples before and after desolvation and further verified by theoretical calculations. This work expands the study on TPE&#8208;cored materials to symmetry&#8208;reduced ligand and might bring forward novel structures and excellent photoluminescent properties in the future.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Plant&#8208;Produced Toxin Strychnine Elucidated</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While natural products isolated from plants have historically been an important source of bioactive molecules, elucidating their biosynthetic pathways has remained a challenging process. Strychnine is the one such compound known for its neurotoxicity and use as a rodent pesticide. Considerable interest has been shown in the synthesis of strychnine for many decades, yet little was known about its biosynthesis. A recent report from the O&#8217;Connor lab has solved this long&#8208;standing puzzle using modern transcriptomic and transient expression approaches to uncover each enzyme responsible for the production of strychnine along with an unexpected final non&#8208;enzymatic step.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfectly Isotactic Polypropylene upon In Situ Activation of Ultrarigid meso Hafnocenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For more than 40 years, the synthesis of C  2  &#8208;symmetric indenyl&#8208;based racemic metallocenes for the isoselective polymerization of propylene relied on a tedious separation of the produced  rac  and  meso  isomers. Status quo, latter are considered wasteful as they produce atactic polypropylene (aPP) rather than isotactic polypropylene (iPP) if activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Unexpectedly, the  in situ  activation of  meso  hafnocene  I  yielded perfectly isotactic polypropylene. We verified an isomerization of the  meso  compound to the corresponding  racemic  one upon triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) addition  via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and established an easy and convenient polymerization protocol, enabling productivities comparable to pure  rac  &#8208;  I  if applied to pure  meso  &#8208;  I  or a mixture of both isomers. With this established isomerization protocol, the potential yield of iPP was enhanced by more than 400%. This protocol was also shown to be applicable to other  meso  hafnocenes and some initial mechanistic insights were received.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Control of Selenium Functionalization in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central &#960;&#8208;core engineering of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) is effective in boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Especially, selenium (Se) functionalization of NF&#8208;SMAs is considered a promising strategy but the structure&#8208;performance relationship remain unclear. Here, we synthesize two isomeric alkylphenyl&#8208;substituted selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs named mPh4F&#8208;TS and mPh4F&#8208;ST with different substitution positions, and contrast them with the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based analogue, mPh4F&#8208;TT. When placing Se atoms at the outer positions of the &#960;&#8208;core, mPh4F&#8208;TS shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact molecular stacking. The PM6:mPh4F&#8208;TS devices exhibit excellent absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, PM6:mPh4F&#8208;TS achieves more balanced photovoltaic parameters and yields an efficiency of 18.05%, which highlights that precisely manipulating Se is a practicable way toward high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Edged [4]Triangulene: Facile Synthesis and Two&#8208;Dimensional On&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triangulenes have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science, but suffer from their high instability towards oxygen. Embedding heteroatoms into triangulenes provides a new class of ambient stable materials for various applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Triangulenes have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science, but suffer from their high instability towards oxygen. Embedding heteroatoms into triangulenes provides a new class of ambient stable materials for various applications. However, [3]heterotriangulenes have dominated the chemistry of heteroatom-doped triangulenes, while their higher homologues have been rarely explored. In this work, we synthesize a new [4]heterotriangulene with three oxygen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen (OBO) segments incorporated into the zigzag edges. The planar geometry of the OBO-doped [4]triangulene is demonstrated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Self-assembly on metal surfaces reveals substrate-dependent nanostructures, leading to different long-range ordered 2D patterns on Ag and Cu substrates with negligible defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Human Cell Membranes Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was able to resolve the distribution of molecules in human pancreatic cancer cell membranes. TERS imaging revealed the arrangement of different cell membrane components with a spatial resolution down to 2.5&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Lack of appropriate tools for visualizing cell membrane molecules at the nanoscale in a non&#8208;invasive and label&#8208;free fashion limits our understanding of many vital cellular processes. Here, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the molecular distribution in pancreatic cancer cell (BxPC&#8208;3) membranes in ambient conditions without labelling, with a spatial resolution down to ca. 2.5&#8197;nm. TERS imaging reveals segregation of phenylalanine&#8208;, histidine&#8208;, phosphatidylcholine&#8208;, protein&#8208;, and cholesterol&#8208;rich BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane domains at the nm length&#8208;scale. TERS imaging also showed a cell membrane region where cholesterol is mixed with protein. Interestingly, the higher resolution TERS imaging revealed that the molecular domains observed on the BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane are not chemically &#8220;pure&#8221; but also contain other biomolecules. These results demonstrate the potential of TERS for non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free imaging of cell membranes with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Integrating Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Two&#8208;Dimensional Elastic&#8208;Bending and Reconfigurable Plastic&#8208;Twisting Deformations into an Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations were successfully implemented and could be controlled independently in an organic crystal. The multiple flexibilities enabled both spatial control of the optical transmission for cryogenic applications and the reusability of light polarization rotations.







Abstract
Integrating plasticity and elasticity in anisotropic molecular crystals is theoretically possible and is beneficial in enabling rich and complex deformations; however, it is much harder to implement in practice. Herein, we report a centimeter&#8208;long organic crystal that is two&#8208;dimensionally (2D) elastically bendable not only at room temperature but also at ultralow temperatures (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C). The straight crystal can also be manually twisted and reconfigured to form arbitrary right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helical structures. The integration of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant (LTR) 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations into one organic crystal expands the perspectives of the emerging crystal flexibility. Taking advantage of the unique multiple flexibility characteristics, spatial controllability of optical transmission for cryogenic applications and reusability of light&#8208;polarization rotations have been implemented simultaneously in an organic crystal.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Regulated Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Scalable Modules</title>

A hole transport material (BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F) is designed, and it can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility, a decreased energy disorder and high scalability. The perovskite solar cells based on BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F without any dopant obtain promising power conversion efficiencies of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%) for small&#8208;area devices (0.062&#8197;cm2) and 20.17&#8201;% for large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2).







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport materials (HTMs) remain highly desirable for stable and efficient n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) but rarely succeed. Here, we propose a molecular assembly strategy to overcome the limited optoelectronic properties of organic HTMs by precisely designing a linear organic small molecule BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F from the atomic to the molecular levels. BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility and decreased energy disorder. The resultant pero&#8208;SCs showed a promising efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%), which is the highest certified value of pero&#8208;SCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs, to date. These devices also showed a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 22.50&#8201;% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 20.17&#8201;% for 15.64&#8208;cm2 module. For the first time, the pero&#8208;SCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs realized ultralong stabilities with T80 lifetimes over 1200&#8197;h under operation or thermal aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Characterization of a Proposed Terminal Iron(III) Nitride Intermediate of Nitrogen Fixation Stabilized by a Trisphosphine&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation and low&#8208;temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl) borane), a plausible intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, is reported. EPR spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations define a 2A ground state electronic structure for this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride, placing an unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector.







Abstract
Terminal iron nitrides (Fe&#8801;N) have been proposed as intermediates of Fe&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, and well&#8208;defined synthetic iron nitrides have been characterized in high oxidation states, including FeIV, FeV, and FeVI. This study reports the generation and low temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), which is a proposed intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation by the P3BFe&#8208;catalyst system. CW&#8208; and pulse EPR spectroscopy (HYSCORE and ENDOR), supported by DFT calculations, help to define a 2A ground state electronic structure of this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride species, placing the unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector; this electronic structure is distinct for an iron nitride. The unusual d5&#8208;configuration is stabilized by significant delocalization (&#8776;50&#8201;%) of the unpaired electron onto the axial boron and nitrogen ligands, with a majority of the spin residing on boron.

         <title>Making Polyisoprene Self&#8208;Healable through Microstructure Regulation by Rare&#8208;Earth Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyisoprenes with an appropriate mixture of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures were synthesized by scandium catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of isoprene. The polyisoprenes exhibited excellent elasticity and self&#8208;healability without any external intervention, which is a result of microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a highly flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix at the nanoscale.







Abstract
The creation of self&#8208;healing polymers from commodity olefins is of great interest and importance but has remained a challenge to date. We report here for the first time the synthesis of self&#8208;healing polymers by catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of a simple commodity diene, isoprene. We found that polyisoprenes having an appropriate mixture (ca. 70/30) of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures synthesized by using a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst could act as excellent self&#8208;healing elastomers without any external intervention. The unprecedented self&#8208;healability could be ascribed to nanoscale heterogeneities formed by microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix. The hydrogenated polyisoprenes (without C=C bonds) with the analogous microstructures also exhibited excellent mechanical and self&#8208;healing properties, further demonstrating that even simple polyolefins can be made self&#8208;healable if the microstructures are appropriately regulated.

         <title>Sorbents for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: From Design Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) holds great promise in offering decentralized solutions for broad access to safe drinking water. This Review systematically discusses the moisture extraction mechanisms and related design rules of various sorbent materials. Device engineering and multifunctional applications are also discussed to present a comprehensive picture of sorbent&#8208;based AWH.







Abstract
Water scarcity caused by climate change and population growth poses a grave threat to human society. Of the different water purification technologies put forward, one presents a promising strategy that is spatially or temporally non&#8208;restricted&#8212;atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Here we review recent progress in the design and study of AWH sorbents, ranging from the innovative chemistries to the integration of sophisticated architectures and functional components, and clarify the structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship that governs the water capture and release processes. Features and limitations of each type of sorbents are summarized to elucidate the optimal working environments and modes. Progress in applications extending from water generation to thermal management and agriculture are discussed. Future developments regarding material modifications, performance measurements, and system optimizations are provided to overcome lingering barriers to sorbent design and implementation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In neutral aqueous solution, a single&#8208;atom nanozyme Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic active sites exhibited ultra&#8208;high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and durability of 100&#8197;h for electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO2, while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97&#8201;% over &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE reached a maximum of 1.23&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (turnover frequency of 69.7&#8197;s&#8722;1) with an FE of 99.6&#8201;%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has an increase and a decrease in the 
 and dxz/yz orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site is more superior to activate CO2 molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.

         <title>Two Radical SAM Enzymes Are Necessary and Sufficient for the In Vitro Production of the Oxetane Nucleoside Antiviral Agent Albucidin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the oxetane nucleoside albucidin was demonstrated in vitro to proceed in two steps involving the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction reaction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which is responsible for the elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. These activities are uncommon among the presently described radical SAM enzymes.







Abstract
Oxetanocin&#8197;A and albucidin are two oxetane natural products. While the biosynthesis of oxetanocin&#8197;A has been described, less is known about albucidin. In this work, the albucidin biosynthetic gene cluster is identified in Streptomyces. Heterologous expression in a nonproducing strain demonstrates that the genes alsA and alsB are necessary and sufficient for albucidin biosynthesis confirming a previous study (Myronovskyi et&#8197;al. Microorganisms 2020, 8, 237). A two&#8208;step construction of albucidin 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphate from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine monophosphate (2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP) is shown to be catalyzed in vitro by the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which catalyzes elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. Isotope labelling studies show that AlsB catalysis begins with stereospecific H&#8208;atom transfer of the C2&#8242;&#8208;pro&#8208;R hydrogen from 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP to 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, and that the eliminated one&#8208;carbon fragment originates from C3&#8242; of 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Splitting of Mono&#8208; and Dibranched Hexane Isomers by a Robust Zinc&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high surface area and optimal pore aperture has been used for the discrimination of alkane isomers. It adsorbs linear and monobranched alkanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, with high capacities and selectivities, outperforming other splitters for alkane isomers.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency separation of C6 alkanes, particularly the mono&#8208; and dibranched isomers by using porous solids, is of paramount significance in the petrochemical industry and, remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we report the complete separation of linear/monobranched hexanes from their dibranched isomers through selective size&#8208;exclusion by a microporous MOF, Zn&#8208;tcpt (H3tcpt=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine), with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of hms nets. Importantly, its adsorption capacity and selectivity are notably higher than those of the previously reported adsorbents that can split mono&#8208; and dibranched alkane isomers. Dynamic breakthrough measurements verify the excellent separation of C6 alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt, and the size&#8208;exclusion based separation mechanism has been confirmed by ab initio materials modeling. The high&#8208;efficiency separation of alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt can be attributed to its optimal pore dimensions as well as high porosity.

     alt="High-Capacity Splitting of Mono- and Dibranched Hexane Isomers by a Robust Zinc-Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microporous Zn-based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high surface area and optimal pore aperture has been used for the discrimination of alkane isomers. It adsorbs linear and monobranched alkanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, with high capacities and selectivities, outperforming other splitters for alkane isomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-efficiency separation of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes, particularly the mono- and dibranched isomers by using porous solids, is of paramount significance in the petrochemical industry and, remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we report the complete separation of linear/monobranched hexanes from their dibranched isomers through selective size-exclusion by a microporous MOF, Zn-tcpt (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;tcpt=2,4,6-tris(4-carboxyphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine), with a two-fold interpenetrated structure of &lt;b&gt;hms&lt;/b&gt; nets. Importantly, its adsorption capacity and selectivity are notably higher than those of the previously reported adsorbents that can split mono- and dibranched alkane isomers. Dynamic breakthrough measurements verify the excellent separation of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; alkane isomers by Zn-tcpt, and the size-exclusion based separation mechanism has been confirmed by &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; initio materials modeling. The high-efficiency separation of alkane isomers by Zn-tcpt can be attributed to its optimal pore dimensions as well as high porosity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Based Supramolecular Access to Full&#8208;Scale Phase&#8208;Diagram Structures through in situ Phase&#8208;Volume Ratio Phototuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy was demonstrated based on the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules (persulfurated arenes) and block polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions, leading to a progressive and wide&#8208;ranging phase transitions across the phase diagram under different irradiation periods.







Abstract
Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self&#8208;assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide&#8208;range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full&#8208;scale phase&#8208;diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods. Moreover, the phase transition was accompanied by considerable aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity change for building a functional surface. This strategy allows for a conceptual advance of accessing a wide range of distinct self&#8208;assembled structures and functions in real time.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self-assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide-range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far-from-equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation-induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an in situ phase-volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full-scale phase-diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution by Side&#8208;Group Engineered Benzodiimidazole Oligomers with Strong Built&#8208;in Electric Fields and Short&#8208;Range Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insufficient charge separation and sluggish exciton transport severely limit the utilization of polymeric photocatalysts. To resolve the above issues, we incorporate bountiful carboxyl substituents within a novel benzodiimidazole oligomer and assemble it into a crystalline semiconductor. The photocatalyst is polar, hydrophilic, short&#8208;range crystalline, and capable of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The introduction of carboxyl side&#8208;groups adds asymmetry to the local structure and increases the built&#8208;in electric field. Further, accelerated carrier transfer is enabled via the short&#8208;range crystallinity. The superior hydrogen and oxygen production rates of 18.63 and 2.87 mmol g&#8210;1  h&#8210;1  represent one of the best performances ever reported among dual&#8208;functional polymeric photocatalysts. Our work initiates studies on high&#8208;performance oligomer photocatalysts, opening a new frontier to produce solar fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges and and Breakthroughs in Selective Amide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>:  In contrast to ketones and carboxylic esters, amides are classically seen as comparatively unreactive members of the carbonyl family, owing to their unique structural and electronic features. However, recent decades have seen the emergence of research programs focused on the selective activation of amides under mild conditions. In the past four years, this area has continued to rapidly develop, with new advances coming in at a fast pace. Several novel activation strategies have been demonstrated as effective tools for selective amide activation, enabling transformations that are at once synthetically useful and mechanistically intriguing. This review comprises recent advances in the field, highlighting new trends and breakthroughs in what could be called a new age of amide activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Assisted Click&#8208;Chemistry for Proximity&#8208;Driven, Site&#8208;Specific Acetylation of Histones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of histones are essential in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Among these modifications, lysine acetylation is one of the most established. Earlier studies relied on the use of chromatin containing heterogeneous mixtures of histones acetylated at multiple sites. Differentiating the individual contribution of single acetylation events towards chromatin regulation is thus of great relevance. However, it is difficult to access homogeneous samples of histones, with a single acetylation, in sufficient quantities for such studies. By engineering histone H3 with a cysteine in proximity of the lysine of interest, we demonstrate that conjugation with maleimide&#8208;DBCO followed by a strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction results in the acetylation of a single lysine in a controlled, site&#8208;specific manner. The chemical precision offered by our click&#8208;to&#8208;acetylate approach will facilitate access to and the study of acetylated histones.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids and derivatives all the way to their corresponding methyl&#8208;compounds is very rare and still challenging for homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report an unprecedented and general catalytic exhaustive reduction of carboxylic functional group straightforwardly to a methyl group. This reaction was achieved using earth&#8208;abundant and readily available titanium as a catalyst. Our system has broad functional group tolerance and works for various other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates (&gt;100 examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the in situ&#8208;generated TiIII&#8208;H species was vital for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrowband Emissive TADF Conjugated Polymers towards Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) conjugated polymers usually show broad emission spectra due to the large structure relaxation, which is not desirable for high&#8208;quality organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. Herein, through attaching multiple resonance (MR) induced emitting moiety as pendant onto the polycarbazole backbone, TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emission are demonstrated. The obtained conjugated polymers exhibit typical TADF characteristics with narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 33&#8208;43 nm. The solution&#8208;processed devices employing these polymers as emissive layers realize excellent performances with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.5%, emission peak at 496 nm and FWHM of 34 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury in Real Time with a Reversible NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescent Redox Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) is responsible for liver dysfunction, which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the most critical marker. Real&#8208;time monitoring of ROS during HIRI can provide significant chance for early diagnosis and timely intervention. However, there is no probe available to track ROS fluctuations during HIRI in vivo, as it is extremely challenging to design reversibly responsive fluorescent probe in near&#8208;infrared region. Here, a reversible redox probe REPOMs emitting beyond 1500 nm is proposed to fill the blank, using rare earth ions&#8208;doped nanoparticles as emitter, and molybdenum&#8208;based polyoxometalate nanoclusters as the ROS&#8208;recognition site and emission modulator. REPOMs exhibited excellent response towards the repeated cycle between ROS and glutathione, based on which the time&#8208;resolved ROS changes during HIRI were successfully obtained. This reversible probe may provide a powerful tool to promote the hepatology research in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Pyritide A2 through Pyridine Ring Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyritides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide class of natural products that were recently genome&#8208;predicted and are structurally defined by unique pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycles. Inspired by their biosynthesis, proceeding through peptide modification and cycloaddition to form the heterocyclic core, we report the chemical synthesis of pyritide A2 involving pyridine ring synthesis from an amino acid precursor  via  aza Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. This strategy permitted the preparation of the decorated pyridine core with an appended amino acid residue in two steps from a commercially available arginine derivative and secured pyritide A2 in ten steps. Moreover, the synthetic logic enables efficient preparation of different pyridine subunits associated with pyritides, allowing the rapid and convergent access to this new class of natural products and analogs thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiomeric NIR&#8208;II Emitting Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped Ag2Se Nanoparticles with Differentiated In Vivo Imaging Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low photoluminescence quantum difference rate and weak targeting ability make the practical application of NIR&#8208;II nanoparticles challenging. Here, NIR&#8208;II chiral rare&#8208;earth doped Ag  2  Se nanoparticles (defined as R&#8208; or S&#8208;Ag  2  Se NPs) were fabricated, exhibiting circular dichroism signal peak at 850 nm and fluorescence emission peak at 1550 nm, with 145.7&#8208;fold enhanced intensity compared to the reported Ag  2  Se NPs. Compared with S&#8208;Ag  2  Se NPs, a significant improvement in imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag  2  Se NPs was observed in living cells, which was attributed to a higher cellular uptake rate and 927.7&#8208;fold higher affinity. Furthermore, R&#8208;Ag  2  Se NPs reached at the tumor 2&#8208;fold faster than S&#8208;Ag  2  Se NPs  in vivo  . We discover that chirality leads to differences in the affinity of chiral Ag  2  Se NPs for 4T1 cell surface CD44, further causing the differences of  in vivo  imaging efficiency. These results reveal that chiral Ag  2  Se NPs have high photoluminescence intensity and high  in vivo  imaging efficiency reflecting wide applications in biomedical diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain Control Toward Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are rivaling most commercial photovoltaics in the aspect of efficiency and cost, while the intrinsic instability remains a major concern for their practical deployment. The presence of undesirable strain in PSCs during device fabrication and operation refers to extension/narrowing of chemical bonds and expansion/shrinkage of lattice volume, which largely affect device stability due to the promoted phase transition, chemical decomposition and mechanical fragility. Forefront investigations and aggressive achievements have revealed that strain control is dispensable in the design of stable PSCs. Herein, the evolution of strain in perovskite thin films and its effect on device performance is elucidated, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies of strain modulation are systematically reviewed. A thorough understanding and cautious control of the strain&#8208;related phenomenon pave the pathway to derive perovskite materials with desired properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC&#160;I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHC&#160;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC&#160;I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;Dracocephalone A and (&#177;)&#8208;Dracocequinones A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;dracocephalone A (  1  ) and (&#177;)&#8208;dracocequinones A (  4  ) and B (  5  ). The synthesis was initially envisioned as proceeding through an intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, a strategy that eventually evolved into a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization. This highly diastereoselective transformation set the stage for  trans  &#8208;decalin formation and a late&#8208;stage Su&#225;rez oxidation that produced a [3.2.1] oxabicycle suited for conversion to  1  . Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated aromatization, followed by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations, allowed for rearrangement to a [2.2.2] oxabicycle poised for conversion to  4  and  5  .</dc:description>

Br&#248;nsted acid-mediated aromatization, followed by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations, allowed for rearrangement to a [2.2.2] oxabicycle poised for conversion to  4  and  5  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites, made of nanograins with the same composition but different phases, offer a platform to optimize the physiochemical performance of materials. Herein, we demonstrate a straightforward strategy to synthesize Cu2&#8208;xS phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites by retaining surface 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands, in contrast to the traditional method that strips the ligands. As a result, phase junctions between a conventional monoclinic (m) phase and an unconventional metastable tetragonal (t) phase are obtained. The significantly improved power factor is obtained due to the doping of the t&#8208;phase. The phase&#8208;junction interfaces reduce thermal conductivity. Finally, surface regulation of phase junctions pushes the peak  zT  to 2.1 at 932 K, being the highest reported for environment&#8208;friendly metal sulfides. This work provides a paradigm to optimize thermoelectric performance by controlling phase junctions through surface&#8208;ligand tuning.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes with alkenes is of much interest and importance as a straightforward route for the construction of four&#8208;membered carbocycles but has remained much underexplored to date.

The reaction proceeded through an allene C(sp  2  )&#8722;H activation mechanism initiated by the site&#8208;selective deprotonation of the allene unit by a rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl species followed by alkene insertion into the resulting metal&#8722;allenyl bond and the subsequent intramolecular cycloaddition to an allene C=C bond.

         <title>Lipid Mass Tags via Aziridination for Probing Unsaturated Lipid Isomers and Accurate Relative Quantification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aziridine&#8208;based isobaric labeling strategy is developed for lipid accurate relative quantification, isomer identification, and ionization efficiency improvement. This strategy allows multiplex analysis without using lipid internal standards and characterization of lipid double&#8208;bond positional isomers. We envision it will accelerate the discovery of lipid biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapeutic response prediction.







Abstract
Knowing concentrations of lipids is essential for understanding their physiological functions and discovering new disease biomarkers. However, it is highly challenging to accurately quantify lipids due to structural diversity and multiple isomeric forms of lipids. To address these critical gaps, we have developed a novel aziridine&#8208;based isobaric tag labelling strategy that allows (i) determination of lipid double&#8208;bond positional isomers, (ii) accurate relative quantification of unsaturated lipids, and (iii) improvement of ionization efficiencies of nonpolar lipids. The power of this method is demonstrated in characterization and quantification of various categories of lipids such as fatty acids, phosphoglycerol lipids, cholesteryl esters (CE), and glycerides. 17 CE lipid isomers were identified and quantified simultaneously from Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse serum without using lipid standards. Among them, 6 CE isomers showed significant changes in concentrations in AD serum.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis: From Nitrite and Cyanate as Major Products to Nitrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea electrooxidation to N2 is a promising anodic process for producing renewable fuels at the cathode. However, Ni(OH)2&#8208;catalyzed urea oxidation predominantly produces a &#8776;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of nitrite+cyanate, with N2 being a minor product. A mechanistic analysis suggests that the binding site availability for both N atoms in urea is crucial for reaction selectivity. Doping Ni(OH)2 with Cu significantly suppresses the cyanate+nitrate pathway.







Abstract
The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to N2 represents an efficient route to simultaneous nitrogen removal from N&#8208;enriched waste and production of renewable fuels at the cathode. However, the overoxidation of urea to NOx&#8722; usually dominates over its oxidation to N2 at Ni(OH)2&#8208;based anodes. Furthermore, detailed reaction mechanisms of UOR remain unclear, hindering the rational catalyst design. We found that UOR to NOx&#8722; on Ni(OH)2 is accompanied by the formation of near stoichiometric amount of cyanate (NCO&#8722;), which enabled the elucidation of UOR mechanisms. Based on our experimental and computational findings, we show that the formation of NOx&#8722; and N2 follows two distinct vacancy&#8208;dependent pathways. We also demonstrate that the reaction selectivity can be steered towards N2 formation by altering the composition of the catalyst, e.g., doping the catalyst with copper (Ni0.8Cu0.2(OH)2) increases the faradaic efficiency of N2 from 30&#8201;% to 55&#8201;%.

         <title>Alternating Terpolymers through Cyclopolymerization and Subsequent Orthogonal Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alternating radical copolymerization of divinyl monomer A and hex&#8208;5&#8208;enyl vinyl ether (HVE) using reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) is reported. The obtained cyclopolymer B can chemically be further modified by three orthogonal functionalization reactions i.e. thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, amidation and transesterification or acylation to provide access to various alternating ABC&#8208;type terpolymers C.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of functionalized alternating copolymers by reversible deactivation radical polymerization was developed. Copolymerization by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer of hexenyl vinyl ether with a novel fluorinated divinyl monomer yields alternating cyclopolymers that can be chemoselectively modified by three distinct orthogonal functionalization reactions. Along the thiol&#8208;ene click reaction and amidation, a third functionalization was achieved via NHC&#8208;catalyzed transesterification or acylation resulting in a small library of ABC&#8208;type alternating terpolymers.

         <title>Tuning Intramolecular Stacking of Rigid Heteroaromatic Compounds for High&#8208;Efficiency Deep&#8208;Blue Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrapure&#8208;blue through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) emitters have been constructed by the close intramolecular stacking of rigid heteroaromatic compounds. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show the best performances among all currently reported deep&#8208;blue TSCT thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters and a sequentially hypochromic&#8208;shift emission with CIEy coordinates ranging from 0.122 to 0.034.







Abstract
A series of ultrapure&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) have been constructed by close stacking between the donor and acceptor moieties in rigid heteroaromatic compounds. The obviously accelerated radiative transition of singlet excitons, the diminished vibrionic relaxation of ground and excited states, and the consequent reduced Stokes shift and the narrow emission are evident. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on AC&#8208;BO realize the best performance among all deep&#8208;blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters, with an external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 19.3&#8201;%. Furthermore, the OLEDs based on QAC&#8208;BO display an EQEmax of 15.8&#8201;%, and achieve the first high&#8208;efficiency ultrapure&#8208;blue TSCT&#8208;TADF material with an excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate (CIE) of (0.145, 0.076) which perfectly matches the ultrapure&#8208;blue CIE requirements (0.14, 0.08) defined by the National Television System Committee.

         <title>Repetitive Thiazolidine Deprotection Using a Thioester&#8208;Compatible Aldehyde Scavenger for One&#8208;Pot Multiple Peptide Ligation

A novel one&#8208;pot sequential peptide ligation strategy using N&#8208;terminal thiazolidine peptides and a newly designed 2&#8208;aminobenzamide&#8208;based aldehyde scavenger is reported. The scavenger efficiently deprotected the thiazolidine group at pH&#8197;4.0 but not at pH&#8197;7.5 of the ligation condition, and showed sufficient compatibility with the thioester. The pH&#8208;controlled one&#8208;pot assembly of four peptide segments allowed us to accomplish the total chemical synthesis of Arabidopsis monoubiquitinated histone H2A.Z (209 amino acids, 23&#8197;kD).







Abstract
Strategies for one&#8208;pot peptide ligation enable chemists to access synthetic proteins at a high yield in a short time. Herein, we report a novel one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;segments ligation strategy using N&#8208;terminal thiazolidine (Thz) peptide and a newly designed formaldehyde scavenger. Among the designed 2&#8208;aminobenzamide&#8208;based aldehyde scavengers, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylbenzohydrazide (AMDBH) can remarkably convert Thz into unprotected cysteine at pH&#8197;4.0. Furthermore, AMDBH degrades Thz at a considerably low rate at pH&#8197;7.5, and thioester degradation caused by this scavenger is negligible. As a result, we have developed an efficient one&#8208;pot peptide ligation strategy by simply repetitively changing the pH with AMDBH. Finally, we synthesize mono&#8208;ubiquitinated histone H2A.Z (209 amino acids) via AMDBH&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot four&#8208;segment peptide ligation in good yield.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Multiply Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Fused Porphyrins by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tandem C&#8722;H functionalization/annulation of porphyrins with internal alkynes gives singly, doubly, and quadruply seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring fused porphyrins. This is the first example of [5+2] annulation reaction for porphyrins. The optical and electrochemical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps, as well as the aromatic character of the fused porphyrins decrease as the number of fused parts increases.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of meso&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl NiII porphyrins with internal alkynes proceeded smoothly to give singly, doubly, and quadruply seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring fused NiII porphyrins as the first example of [5+2] annulation reaction for porphyrin substrates, where the meso&#8208;appended pyrrole unit serves as a directing group. These reactions are operationally quite simple and easy. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the isolation of a key intermediate. The structures of the representative products have been revealed to be considerably bent owing to the implemented seven&#8208;membered rings. Doubly fused ZnII and NiII porphyrins possessing an unsubstituted meso&#8208;position were dimerized to meso&#8208;meso linked dimers by aerobic oxidation with Zn(OAc)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O and electrochemical oxidation, respectively. The optical and electrochemical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps, as well as the aromatic characters of the fused porphyrins decrease as the fusion parts increases.

         <title>Proton Transfer Pathways in Nitrogenase with and without Dissociated S2B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possible proton transfer pathways in the active&#8208;site FeMo cluster of nitrogenase from the S5A, S4A or S3B sulfide ions to the substrate were studied through combined quantum and molecular mechanical calculations. The results show that the barriers are prohibitively high if the S2B sulfide ion has dissociated from the cluster, but are reasonable with S2B bound.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can convert N2 to NH3. Crystallographic structures have indicated that one of the sulfide ligands of the active&#8208;site FeMo cluster, S2B, can be replaced by an inhibitor, like CO and OH&#8722;, and it has been suggested that it may be displaced also during the normal reaction. We have investigated possible proton transfer pathways within the FeMo cluster during the conversion of N2H2 to two molecules of NH3, assuming that the protons enter the cluster at the S3B, S4B or S5A sulfide ions and are then transferred to the substrate. We use combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations with the TPSS and B3LYP functionals. The calculations indicate that the barriers for these reactions are reasonable if the S2B ligand remains bound to the cluster, but they become prohibitively high if S2B has dissociated. This suggests that it is unlikely that S2B reversibly dissociates during the normal reaction cycle.

         <title>Blending the Optical and Redox Properties of Oligoynes and Boron Difluoride Formazanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active boron difluoride formazanate end&#8208;caps are used to stabilize symmetric and asymmetric families of oligoynes containing between 2 and 10 alkyne units. These oligoyne&#8208;dye conjugates exhibit multiple redox waves and panchromatic absorption profiles.







Abstract
Oligoynes and polyynes are 1D chains of conjugated sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms consisting of alternating single and triple bonds. Their stability rapidly decreases with increasing chain length beyond only a few repeating units. Design strategies, such as the use of bulky end&#8208;capping groups, allow for their characterization and isolation while not contributing significantly to their physical properties. In this study, we incorporate redox&#8208;active BF2 formazanate dyes (BF2) as end&#8208;caps to prepare symmetric (BF2&#8722;[C&#8801;C]n&#8722;BF2) and asymmetric (BF2&#8722;[C&#8801;C]n&#8722;Si(iPr)3) families of oligoynes containing up to 10 alkyne units. In doing so, we introduce stable oligoynes that possess a blend of optical and redox properties that cannot be achieved by either oligoynes or BF2 formazanates individually (e.g., panchromatic absorption, multiple and tunable reversible redox waves). This approach is transferable to other functional end&#8208;caps to facilitate the preparation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials with utility in the organic electronics arena.

     alt="Blending the Optical and Redox Properties of Oligoynes and Boron Difluoride Formazanates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox-active boron difluoride formazanate end-caps are used to stabilize symmetric and asymmetric families of oligoynes containing between 2 and 10 alkyne units. These oligoyne-dye conjugates exhibit multiple redox waves and panchromatic absorption profiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligoynes and polyynes are 1D chains of conjugated &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;-hybridized carbon atoms consisting of alternating single and triple bonds. Their stability rapidly decreases with increasing chain length beyond only a few repeating units. Design strategies, such as the use of bulky end-capping groups, allow for their characterization and isolation while not contributing significantly to their physical properties. In this study, we incorporate redox-active BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formazanate dyes (&lt;b&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) as end-caps to prepare symmetric (&lt;b&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;[C&#8801;C]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and asymmetric (&lt;b&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;[C&#8801;C]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Green and Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Biocatalysts Using Covalent Organic Frameworks as Enzyme Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ assembly of enzymes and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables the environmentally benign large&#8208;scale fabrication of a new generation of high&#8208;performance biocatalysts. This approach shows how limitations in enzyme immobilization can be overcome and it opens up a new avenue for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance biocatalysts to accelerate enzyme industrialization.







Abstract
Enzyme immobilization is essential to the commercial viability of various critical large&#8208;scale biocatalytic processes. However, challenges remain for the immobilization systems, such as difficulties in loading large enzymes, enzyme leaching, and limitations for large&#8208;scale fabrication. Herein, we describe a green and scalable strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance biocatalysts through in situ assembly of enzymes with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under ambient conditions (aqueous solution and room temperature). The obtained biocatalysts have exceptional reusability and stability and serve as efficient biocatalysts for important industrial reactions that cannot be efficiently catalyzed by free enzymes or traditional enzyme immobilization systems. Notably, this versatile enzyme immobilization platform is applicable to various COFs and enzymes. The reactions in an aqueous solution occurred within a short timeframe (ca. 10&#8211;30&#8197;min) and could be scaled up readily (ca. 2.3&#8197;g per reaction).

         <title>Emissive Metallacage&#8208;Cored Polyurethanes with Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of metallacage&#8208;cored polyurethanes was prepared using emissive metallacages as crosslinks. As the content of the metallacages increases, the mechanical properties of such polymers are greatly enhanced. These polymers not only show intense emission both in solution and in the solid state, but also exhibit good self&#8208;healing and shape memory properties, which promotes the applications of metallacage&#8208;cored networks as elastic smart materials.







Abstract
The structures of the crosslinks in supramolecular polymer networks play an important role on their properties and functions. Herein, emissive metallacages are used as crosslinks to prepare metallacage&#8208;cored polyurethanes. The mechanical properties including storage modulus, toughness, Young's modulus and breaking strength of polymers are greatly enhanced with the increase of crosslinking densities. Moreover, such polymers not only exhibit good fluorescence in the solid state, but also show self&#8208;healing and shape memory properties owing to the dynamic reversible non&#8208;covalent bonds in their structures. This study not only offers a convenient strategy to prepare metallacage&#8208;crosslinked networks, but also explores their applications as self&#8208;healing and shape memory materials, which will promote the study of metallacage&#8208;cored supramolecular networks as smart materials.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;based Supramolecular Plastics Mediated by Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) was driven by the non&#8208;covalent association of a disulfide bond linked azobenzene macrocycle with negative charges and a small cationic surfactant. The LLPS resulted in three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular plastic materials that were highly adhesive at high water content and tough and stretchable at low water content. The resulting materials were also reusable and highly recyclable.







Abstract
Plastics are one of the most widely used polymeric materials. However, they are often undegradable and non&#8208;recyclable due to the very stable covalent bonds of macromolecules, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Here, we report that liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) could drive the formation of robust, stable, and sustainable plastics using small molecules. The LLPS process could sequester and concentrate solutes, strengthen the non&#8208;covalent association between molecules and produce a bulk material whose property was highly related to the encapsulated water amounts. It was a robust plastic with a remarkable Young's modulus of 139.5&#8197;MPa when the water content was low while became adhesive and could instantly self&#8208;heal with more absorbed water. Finally, responsiveness enabled the material to be highly recyclable. This work allowed us to understand the LLPS at the molecular level and demonstrated that LLPS is a promising approach to exploring eco&#8208;friendly supramolecular plastics that are potential substitutes for conventional polymers.

         <title>Ring&#8208;to&#8208;Thread Chirality Transfer in [2]Rotaxanes for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The base&#8208;promoted cyclization of N&#8208;(arylmethyl)fumaramide threads present in orientational mechanostereoisomers, which contain a single stereogenic center in the ring, allows the generation of enantioenriched lactams of different ring sizes as well as amino acids. The chiral information is effectively transmitted across the mechanical bond from the encircling ring to the new interlocked functionality.







Abstract
The synthesis of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years, with applications in different fields, such as asymmetric catalysis or sensing. Herein we describe the synthesis of orientational mechanostereoisomers, which include a benzylic amide macrocycle with a stereogenic center, and nonsymmetric N&#8208;(arylmethyl)fumaramides as the axis. The base&#8208;promoted cyclization of the initial fumaramide thread allows enantioenriched value&#8208;added compounds, such as lactams of different ring sizes and amino acids, to be obtained. The chiral information is effectively transmitted across the mechanical bond from the encircling ring to the interlocked lactam. High levels of enantioselectivity and full control of the regioselectivity of the final cyclic compounds are attained.

         <title>Encoding Supramolecular Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly with Photo&#8208;Controlled Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Overcrowded Alkene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;PBI Modulators</title>

         <dc:description>
Two chiral overcrowded alkene&#8208;based modulators were designed, which self&#8208;assembled into &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking nanofibers, inducing opposite circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) through the amplification of intrinsically molecular chirality. Upon UV light irradiation, a transformation from nanofibers to nanospheres resulted in a gradual decrease in CPL signal, providing a photo&#8208;controllable CPL system.







Abstract
Developing photoresponsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials is an essential step for biosensing and biomedical applications. However, fabricating CPL assemblies rooted in the chirality amplification and transmission of the molecular building blocks, which simultaneously show photo&#8208;controllable CPL signals, remains challenging. Herein, a molecular building block containing an overcrowded&#8208;alkene core and bis&#8208;PBI (MPBI) was designed. Importantly, the enantiopure MPBI can self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;organized nanofibers via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and enable the transmission of the intrinsic chirality, providing opposite CPL signals. The photoisomerization of MPBI induced a transformation from nanofibers to discrete nanospheres, accompanied by a gradually decreased CPL signal. The results demonstrated the development of photo&#8208;controllable CPL materials from the assembly of chiral MPBI, which provides an alternatively facile strategy to fabricate CPL&#8208;active materials and would offer opportunities for future biosensing and biomedical applications.

         <title>Semisynthesis of Homogeneous, Active Granulocyte Colony&#8208;Stimulating Factor Glycoforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four variants of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G&#8208;CSF) were prepared via semisynthesis. A new PEGylated photocleavable linker enabled quantitative glycosylation of the C&#8208;terminal fragment and selenocysteine&#8208;based ligation as well as expressed protein selenoester ligation helped to overcome solubility issues.







Abstract
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G&#8208;CSF) is a cytokine used to treat neutropenia. Different glycosylated and non&#8208;glycosylated variants of G&#8208;CSF for therapeutic application are currently generated by recombinant expression. Here, we describe our approaches to establish a first semisynthesis strategy to access the aglycone and O&#8208;glycoforms of G&#8208;CSF, thereby enabling the preparation of selectively and homogeneously post&#8208;translationally modified variants of this important cytokine. Eventually, we succeeded by combining selenocysteine ligation of a recombinantly produced N&#8208;terminal segment with a synthetic C&#8208;terminal part, transiently equipped with a side&#8208;chain&#8208;linked, photocleavable PEG moiety, at low concentration. The transient PEGylation enabled quantitative enzymatic elongation of the carbohydrate at Thr133. Overall, we were able to significantly reduce the problems related to the low solubility and the tendency to aggregate of the two protein segments, which allowed the preparation of four G&#8208;CSF variants that were successfully folded and demonstrated biological activity in cell proliferation assays.

         <title>Discovery of the First Selective Nanomolar Inhibitors of ERAP2 by Kinetic Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis and optimisation led to the first nanomolar ERAP2 inhibitors with outstanding selectivity. The binding modes of the most potent inhibitors were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Our frontrunners engage target in cells and display good in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) is a key enzyme involved in the trimming of antigenic peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I. It is a target of growing interest for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in cancer immunotherapy. However, the discovery of potent and selective ERAP2 inhibitors is highly challenging. Herein, we have used kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) to identify such inhibitors. Co&#8208;crystallization experiments revealed the binding mode of three different inhibitors with increasing potency and selectivity over related enzymes. Selected analogues engage ERAP2 in cells and inhibit antigen presentation in a cellular context. 4&#8201;d (BDM88951) displays favorable in vitro ADME properties and in vivo exposure. In summary, KTGS allowed the discovery of the first nanomolar and selective highly promising ERAP2 inhibitors that pave the way of the exploration of the biological roles of this enzyme and provide lead compounds for drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Glutathione Peroxidase Degrader Induces Ferroptosis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule protein degrader based on the strategy of proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) was designed to deplete glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and regulate cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4 shows a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition. Moreover, the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using a novel type of biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces ferroptosis in vivo to effectively suppress tumor growth without appreciable side effects.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Its therapeutic potential is however, greatly limited by the low efficiency of regulating cell ferroptosis in vivo. Herein, we report a PROTAC&#8208;based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX4 degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition using ML162. Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces cell&#8208;selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the protein degradation strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Radical Hydro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of olefins has been successfully achieved by employing FABI as a FSO2&#8208;radical precursor and ODA as an organic photocatalyst. With this photocatalytic system, radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes can also be realized with a unique, high Z&#8208;selectivity. Utilization of this method is further demonstrated in the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug ligation chemistry.







Abstract
Recently, radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which are highly in demand in various disciplines, particularly in chemical biology and drug discovery. Here, we report the first establishment of radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkenes, which is enabled by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl 2&#8208;aryl benzoimidazolium (FABI) as an effective redox&#8208;active radical precursor. This method provides a new and facile approach for the synthesis of aliphatic sulfonyl fluorides from unactivated alkenes, and can be further applied to the late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and peptides, as well as ligation of drugs in combination with click chemistry. Remarkably, this system could enable the radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes, affording valuable alkenylsulfonyl fluoride products with a rare, high Z&#8208;selectivity, which are normally less stable and more challenging to synthesize in comparison with the E&#8208;configured products.

         <title>Chirality Induction on a Coordination Capsule for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric structures composed of acetic acid and tartaric acid derivatives inside a molecular capsule have been realized. Substituents on the tartaric acid derivatives allowed conveyance of chirality to the capsule, resulting in the enrichment of one of the diastereomers. The chirality&#8208;enriched capsule biased the dynamic axial chirality of a guest carrying benzothiadiazole arms, allowing it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the near infrared region.







Abstract
By utilizing a confined space inside a coordination capsule consisting of achiral components, we achieve trimeric structures composed of acetic acid and 2,3&#8208;disubstituted tartaric acid derivatives. Steric and electronic interactions between the substituents on the tartaric acid and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl arms of the capsule permit the transfer of the chirality of the tartaric acid to the capsule, resulting in diastereoenrichment of the host&#8208;guest complexes of up to 92&#8201;%&#8197;de. The chiral templates can be washed away with diethyl ether, leaving an enantiomerically enriched capsule. The resulting capsule biases the dynamic axial chirality of a 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest carrying benzothiadiazole units, demonstrating guest&#8208;to&#8208;capsule and capsule&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer. The induced chirality on the bound guest enables it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the NIR region, demonstrating the application of induced chirality for confined spaces for the generation of chiroptical properties.

         <title>Bloom Syndrome Helicase Compresses Single&#8208;Stranded DNA into Phase&#8208;Separated Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule optical&#8208;tweezers analysis revealed that Bloom syndrome helicase can undergo phase separation and form condensates on single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA, giving rise to the compression and condensation of ssDNA into the condensates that are stable in the presence of a high resistant force.







Abstract
Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is a conserved RecQ family helicase involved in the maintenance of genome stability. BLM has been widely recognized as a genome &#8220;caretaker&#8221; that processes structured DNA. In contrast, our knowledge of how BLM behaves on single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is still limited. Here, we demonstrate that BLM possesses the intrinsic ability for phase separation and can co&#8208;phase separate with ssDNA to form dynamically arrested protein/ssDNA co&#8208;condensates. The introduction of ATP potentiates the capability of BLM to condense on ssDNA, which further promotes the compression of ssDNA against a resistive force of up to 60 piconewtons. Moreover, BLM is also capable of condensing replication protein A (RPA)&#8208; or RAD51&#8208;coated ssDNA, before which it generates naked ssDNA by dismantling these ssDNA&#8208;binding proteins. Overall, our findings identify an unexpected characteristic of a DNA helicase and provide a new angle of protein/ssDNA co&#8208;condensation for understanding the genomic instability caused by BLM overexpression under diseased conditions.

         <title>Photoinduced Persistent Polarization Change in a Spin Transition Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced persistent polarization change was achieved in an ionic FeII spin&#8208;crossover complex by combining the light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping effect (LIESST) and macroscopic polarization. The pyroelectric current is detected at a crystal level when the light&#8208;induced metastable state returns to the ground state. This study provides a platform for the development of optoelectric materials.







Abstract
Using light as a local heat source to induce a temporary pyroelectric current is widely recognized as an effective way to control the polarization of crystalline materials. In contrast, harnessing light directly to modulate the polarization of a crystal via excitation of the electronic bands remains less explored. In this study, we report an FeII spin crossover crystal that exhibits photoinduced macroscopic polarization change upon excitation by green light. When the excited crystal relaxes to the ground state, the corresponding pyroelectric current can be detected. An analysis of the structures, magnetic properties and the M&#246;ssbauer and infrared spectra of the complex, supported by calculations, revealed that the polarization change is dictated by the directional relative movement of ions during the spin transition process. The spin transition and polarization change occur simultaneously in response to light stimulus, which demonstrates the enormous potential of polar spin crossover systems in the field of optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Momomycin, an Antiproliferative Cryptic Metabolite from the Oxytetracycline Producer Streptomyces rimosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial producers of pharmaceuticals still code for dozens of yet&#8208;to&#8208;be identified natural products. Herein, three groups of cryptic metabolites were uncovered from Streptomyces rimosus, the industrial producer of oxytetracycline, using high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening, notably momomycin, a novel cyclic peptide with antiproliferative properties.







Abstract
Natural products provide an important source of pharmaceuticals and chemical tools. Traditionally, assessment of unexplored microbial phyla has led to new natural products. However, with every new microbe, the number of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) grows. As such, the more difficult proposition is finding new molecules from well&#8208;studied strains. Herein, we targeted Streptomyces rimosus, the widely&#8208;used oxytetracycline producer, for the discovery of new natural products. Using MALDI&#8208;MS&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening (HiTES), we mapped the global secondary metabolome of S.&#8197;rimosus and structurally characterized products of three cryptic BGCs, including momomycin, an unusual cyclic peptide natural product with backbone modifications and several non&#8208;canonical amino acids. We elucidated important aspects of its biosynthesis and evaluated its bioactivity. Our studies showcase HiTES as an effective approach for unearthing new chemical matter from &#8220;drained&#8221; strains.

         <title>Elucidating CO2 Hydrogenation over In2O3 Nanoparticles using Operando UV/Vis and Impedance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 activation over In2O3 nanoparticle catalysts is consistent with redox processes, including oxidation by CO2 as the rate&#8208;determining step, whereby hydrogen&#8208;containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Besides surface processes, subsurface/bulk dynamics are shown to be essential for the activity in reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction, as revealed by operando UV/Vis and impedance spectroscopies.







Abstract
In2O3 has emerged as a promising catalyst for CO2 activation, but a fundamental understanding of its mode of operation in CO2 hydrogenation is still missing, as the application of operando vibrational spectroscopy is challenging due to absorption effects. In this mechanistic study, we systematically address the redox processes related to the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction (rWGSR) over In2O3 nanoparticles, both at the surface and in the bulk. Based on temperature&#8208;dependent operando UV/Vis spectra and a novel operando impedance approach for thermal powder catalysts, we propose oxidation by CO2 as the rate&#8208;determining step for the rWGSR. The results are consistent with redox processes, whereby hydrogen&#8208;containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Our findings demonstrate that oxygen/hydrogen dynamics, in addition to surface processes, are important for the activity, which is expected to be of relevance not only for In2O3 but also for other reducible oxide catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has emerged as a promising catalyst for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, but a fundamental understanding of its mode of operation in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation is still missing, as the application of operando vibrational spectroscopy is challenging due to absorption effects. In this mechanistic study, we systematically address the redox processes related to the reverse water-gas shift reaction (rWGSR) over In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, both at the surface and in the bulk. Based on temperature-dependent operando UV/Vis spectra and a novel operando impedance approach for thermal powder catalysts, we propose oxidation by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the rate-determining step for the rWGSR. The results are consistent with redox processes, whereby hydrogen-containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Our findings demonstrate that oxygen/hydrogen dynamics, in addition to surface processes, are important for the activity, which is expected to be of relevance not only for In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but also for other reducible oxide catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ppm Pd&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles as Catalysts for Negishi Couplings &#8230; in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi couplings rely typically on pre&#8208;formed organozinc reagents, dry organic solvents, and unsustainable loadings of a Pd catalyst (usually 1&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%). In this report we describe heterogeneous nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed couplings under mild conditions using water as the reaction medium, and only ppm levels of a Pd catalyst.







Abstract
New technology is reported that enables Negishi couplings to be run under sustainable, far greener conditions. Thus, ppm Pd&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed that catalyze couplings in recyclable water under very mild conditions. These heterogeneous reactions involve loadings of Pd of typically only 2500&#8197;ppm (0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;%). Highly functionalized aromatic and heteroaromatic bromides readily participate, including examples taken from the Merck Informer Library indicative of the functional group tolerance associated with these couplings. Direct comparisons with existing literature routes are made. Very low residual levels of Pd in newly formed products are to be expected, as determined by ICP&#8208;MS. The reagent involved has been extensively characterized via DLS, TEM, cryo&#8208;TEM, and EDX measurements.

         <title>Spontaneous Decomposition of an Extraordinarily Twisted and Trans&#8208;Bent Fully&#8208;Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Digermene to an Unusual GeI Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a fully phosphanyl&#8208;substituted digermene, {(Mes)2P}2Ge=Ge{P(Mes)2}2 (3), exhibits a uniquely distorted Ge=Ge double bond. Unexpectedly, 3 is unstable in solution, decomposing to a novel GeI cluster (7).







Abstract
Ditetrelenes R2E=ER2 (E=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) substituted by multiple N/P/O/S&#8208;donor groups are extremely rare due to their propensity to disaggregate into their tetrylene monomers R2E. We report the synthesis of the first fully phosphanyl&#8208;substituted digermene {(Mes)2P}2Ge=Ge{P(Mes)2}2 (3, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2), which adopts a highly unusual structure in the solid state, that is both strongly trans&#8208;bent and highly twisted. Variable&#8208;temperature 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy suggests that 3 persists in solution, but is subject to a dynamic equilibrium between two conformations, which have different geometries about the Ge=Ge bond (twisted/non&#8208;twisted) due to a difference in the nature of their &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Compound 3 undergoes unprecedented, spontaneous decomposition in solution to give a unique GeI cluster {(Mes)2P}4Ge4&#8901;5&#8201;CyMe (7).

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Tetrylene&#8208;Tetrylone&#8208;Iron Complexes Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine) Ligands</title>

The germanium and tin iron carbonyl complexes were prepared by the reaction of dimeric chloro(imino)tetrylenes [IPrNECl]2 (E=Ge, Sn; IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) with one equivalent of Na2Fe(CO)4 at room temperature. Besides, a Li/Sn/Fe trimetallic complex was isolated by the reaction of chloro(imino)stannylene with cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl anion.







Abstract
The germanium iron carbonyl complex 3 was prepared by the reaction of dimeric chloro(imino)germylene [IPrNGeCl]2 (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) with one equivalent of Collman's reagent (Na2Fe(CO)4) at room temperature. Similarly, the reaction of chloro(imino)stannylene [IPrNSnCl]2 with Na2Fe(CO)4 (1&#8197;equiv) resulted in the Fe(CO)4&#8208;bridged bis(stannylene) complex 4. We observed reversible formation of bis(tetrylene) and tetrylene&#8208;tetrylone character in complexes 3 vs. 5 and 4 vs. 6, which was supported by DFT calculations. Moreover, the Li/Sn/Fe trimetallic complex 12 has been isolated from the reaction of [IPrNSnCl]2 with cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl anion. The computational analysis further rationalizes the reduction pathway from these chlorotetrylenes to the corresponding complexes.

         <title>Hydrophobicity Graded Gas Diffusion Layer for Stable Electrochemical Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hydrophobicity engineering method has been developed to transform a hydrophilic carbon gas diffusion layer into a hydrophobicity&#8208;graded one. This modification controls gas transport and hydrophobicity as well as mitigates electrolyte flooding of the gas diffusion layer, hence, facilitating stable electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
To mitigate flooding associated with the gas diffusion layer (GDL) during electroreduction of CO2, we report a hydrophobicity&#8208;graded hydrophobic GDL (HGGDL). Coating uniformly dispersed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binders on the carbon fiber skeleton of a hydrophilic GDL uniformizes the hydrophobicity of the GDL and also alleviates the gas blockage of pore channels. Further adherence of the PTFE macroporous layer (PMPL) to one side of the hydrophobic carbon fiber skeleton was aided by sintering. The introduced PMPL shows an appropriate pore size and enhanced hydrophobicity. As a result, the HGGDL offers spatial control of the hydrophobicity and hence water and gas transport over the GDL. Using a nickel&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, the resulting HGGDL electrode provided a CO faradaic efficiency of over 83&#8201;% at a constant current density of 75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 103&#8197;h operation in a membrane electrode assembly, which is more than 16&#8197;times that achieved with a commercial GDL.

         <title>Optimize Lithium Deposition at Low Temperature by Weakly Solvating Power Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reversible Li plating/stripping behavior at low temperature environment is achieved by accelerating the Li+ desolvation process by employing weakly solvating power DMM as electrolyte solvent. As a result, the battery displayed high Li metal coulombic efficiency and avoided dendritic growth from room temperature to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
For lithium (Li) metal batteries, the decrease in operating temperature brings severe safety issues by more disordered Li deposition. Here, we demonstrate that the solvating power of solvent is closely related to the reversibility of the Li deposition/stripping process under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The electrolyte with weakly solvating power solvent shows lower desolvation energy, allowing for a uniform Li deposition morphology, as well as a high deposition/stripping efficiency (97.87&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). Based on a weakly solvating electrolyte, we further built a full cell by coupling the Li metal anode with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile electrode at a low anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio for steady cycling at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Our results clarified the relationship between solvating power of solvent and Li deposition behavior at low temperatures.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Direct Ultralong All&#8208;Phosphorescence from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Photonic Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of transparent MOF glasses are made by a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. They exhibit a rare direct ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) output with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 75&#8201;%. Exploiting the highly efficient ultralong RTP of these MOF glasses, further photonic applications, such as all&#8208;photonic information storage and light&#8208;emitting devices, were developed.







Abstract
Realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is highly desirable but remains a challenge due to the inherent competition between excited state lifetime and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly of transparent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) bulk glasses exhibiting direct ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescence (lifetime: 630.15&#8197;ms) with a PLQY of up to 75&#8201;% at ambient conditions. These macroscopic MOF glasses have high Young's modulus and hardness, which provide a rigid environment to reduce non&#8208;radiative transitions and boost triplet excitons. Spectral technologies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the photoluminescence of MOF glasses is directly derived from the different triplet excited states, indicating the great capability for color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission. We further developed information storage and light&#8208;emitting devices based on the efficient and pure RTP of the fabricated MOF photonic glasses.

         <title>HXV2O5 Nanocatalysts Combined with Ultrasound for Triple Amplification of Oxidative Stress to Enhance Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts (HVO) were constructed and employed as a novel biocatalyst for amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts combined with ultrasound could triply boost tumor oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS would cause mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death.







Abstract
Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. Herein, vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (HXV2O5, for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi&#8208;functional catalytic activity in decomposing H2O2 into &#8901;OH and depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. Collectively, HVO nanocatalysts highlight the remarkable value of ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapies.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Carbamoyloximes for the Activation of Secondary Amines in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbamoylaldoximes undergo mechanochemical homolytic bond scission of the oxime N&#8722;O bond when embedded into polymers. The subsequent radical mechanism yields mainly the nitrile, upon hydrogen dissociation, and the free amine, upon decarboxylation and hydrogen abstraction. Force&#8208;induced organocatalysis is demonstrated for the activation of a secondary amine.







Abstract
Mechanophores are molecular moieties that are incorporated into polymers and respond to force with constitutional, configurational, or conformational bond rearrangements to enable functionality. Up to today, several chemically latent motifs have been activated by polymer mechanochemical methods, but the generation of secondary amines remains elusive. Here we report carbamoyloximes as mechanochemical protecting groups for secondary amines. We show that carbamoyloximes undergo force&#8208;induced homolytic bond scission at the N&#8722;O oxime bond in polymers thus producing the free amine, as the reaction proceeds via the carbamoyloxyl and aminyl radicals, analogously to its photochemical counterpart. Eventually, we apply the carbamoyloxime motif in a force&#8208;activated organocatalytic Knoevenagel reaction. We believe that this protecting strategy can be universally applied for many other secondary and primary amines in polymer materials.

         <title>Identifying and Differentiating Topological G&#8208;Quadruplex Structures with DNA&#8208;Encoded Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures are resolved with a DNA&#8208;encoded nanoparticle growth strategy. In this method, through monitoring the UV/Vis extinction of plasmonic gold nanoparticles grown in the presence of G4s, both topological structures and nucleotide residues within G4 DNA are identified and differentiated.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified as critical elements in modulating genomic functions and many other biological processes. Their functions are highly dependent on the primary nucleotides and secondary folding structures. Therefore, to understand their functions, methods to identify and differentiate structures of G4 with speed and accuracy are required but limited. In this report, we have applied a synthetic G4 DNA&#8208;encoded nanoparticle approach to identify and differentiate G4 DNA molecules with different topologies and nucleotide residues. We found that the resulting plasmonic properties of the gold nanoparticles, monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy, are quite sensitive to different G4 structures, including stacking layers, loop sequences, capping bases on G4s, and topological structures. Through these systematic investigations, we demonstrate that this G4&#8208;encoded gold nanoparticle approach can be used to profile the G4 structures and distinguish G4s from human telomeres. Such a method may have wide applications in G4 research.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Catalysis by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Complex Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation of transition metal complexes (TMCs) into nanodots generates redshifted and broadened absorption covering the visible and the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region compared with the individual molecular complexes. The TMC nanodots demonstrate excellent performance for the carbonylation reaction under solar&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Developing light&#8208;harvesting materials with broad spectral response is of fundamental importance in full&#8208;spectrum solar energy conversion. We found that, when a series of earth&#8208;abundant metal (Cu, Co, Ni and Fe) salts are dissolved in coordinating solvents uniformly dispersed nanodots (NDs) are formed rather than fully dissolving as molecular species. The previously unrecognized formation of this condensed state is ascribed to spontaneous aggregation of molecular transition&#8208;metal&#8208;complexes (TMCs) via weak intermolecular interactions, which results in redshifted and broadened absorption into the NIR region (200&#8211;1100&#8197;nm). Typical photoredox reactions, such as carbonylation and oxidative dehydrogenation, well demonstrate the feasibility of efficient utilization of NIR light (&#955;&gt;780&#8197;nm) by TMCs NDs. Our finding provides a conceptually new strategy for extending the absorption towards low energy photons in solar energy harvesting and conversion via photoredox transformations.

         <title>Perovskite Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction or Photoredox Organic Transformation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskite photocatalytic CO2 reduction in organic solvent is likely problematic. The observed CO product clearly results from photocatalytic organic transformation involving solvents (i.e., ethyl acetate or chloroform). Perovskite&#8208;photocatalyzed generation of CO from solvent at a fast rate may create synthetic opportunities for useful organic syntheses using organic solvent as the CO surrogate.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have been explored as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. We report that perovskite photocatalytic CO2 reduction in organic solvents is likely problematic. Instead, the detected products (i.e., CO) likely result from a photoredox organic transformation involving the solvent. Our observations have been validated using isotopic labeling experiments, band energy analysis, and new control experiments. We designed a typical perovskite photocatalytic setup in organic solvents that led to CO production of up to &#8776;1000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. CO2 reduction in organic solvents must be studied with extra care because photoredox organic transformations can produce orders of magnitude higher rate of CO or CH4 than is typical for CO2 reduction routes. Though CO2 reduction is not likely to occur, in situ CO generation is extremely fast. Hence a suitable system can be established for challenging organic reactions that use CO as a feedstock but exploit the solvent as a CO surrogate.

         <title>Structure of a Promiscuous Thioesterase Domain Responsible for Branching Acylation in Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The OocS branching thioesterase (TEB) catalyzes promiscuous O&#8208;acylation of polyketides. Structural analysis of the TEB domain facilitated engineering to modulate reactivity and acyl&#8208;group acceptance.







Abstract
Thioesterases (TEs) are fundamentally important enzymes present in all bacteria and eukaryotes, where they have conserved functions in fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary metabolism. This work provides the first structural insights into a functionally distinct group of TEs that perform diverse acylations in polyketide and peptide biosynthesis (TEBs). Structural analysis of the oocydin (OocS) TEB domain facilitated identification and engineering of the active site to modulate acyl&#8208;group acceptance. In this way, we achieved higher reactivity using a structure&#8208;based approach, building a foundation for biocatalytic development of TEB&#8208;mediated O&#8208;acylation, a modification known to improve the bioactivity of oocydin&#8208;type polyketides. Lastly, the promiscuity of the OocS TEB motivated us to investigate, and ultimately provide evidence for, the production of longer chain branched oocydins in the native host Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13. This work frames the OocS TEB and homologs as invaluable synthetic biology tools for polyketide drug development.

         <title>Switchable Electrostatically Templated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable templated polymerization system is reported where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated. Regulating the templating effect enables control over the polymerization kinetics and provides an effective &#8220;ON&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;OFF&#8221; switch for polymer growth. The controlled co&#8208;assembly of template and growing polymers with modular association strength provides a novel concept to create and control coupled polymerization and self&#8208;assembly pathways.







Abstract
We report a switchable, templated polymerization system where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated by solution pH and/or ionic strength. The responsiveness to these cues is incorporated through a dendritic polyamidoamine&#8208;based template of which the charge density depends on pH. The dendrimers act as a template for the polymerization of an oppositely charged monomer, namely sodium styrene sulfonate. We show that the rate of polymerization and maximum achievable monomer conversion are directly related to the charge density of the template, and hence the environmental pH. The polymerization could effectively be switched &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; on demand, by cycling between acidic and alkaline reaction environments. These findings break ground for a novel concept, namely harnessing co&#8208;assembly of a template and growing polymer chains with tunable association strength to create and control coupled polymerization and self&#8208;assembly pathways of (charged) macromolecular building blocks.

         <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution Kinetics by Tuning the Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Environment on Functionalized Platinum Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specifically adsorbed organic additives are found to enhance the intrinsic kinetics of hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions in alkaline solution on Pt surfaces by reorganizing the interfacial water structure. In situ vibrational spectroscopies present compelling evidence that weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water has a substantial impact on the hydrogen electrocatalytic process.







Abstract
Developing efficient catalytic systems for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) is essential in the world's transition to renewable energy. There is a growing recognition that the HOR/HER activity depends on properties of the electrochemical interface, rather than just the composition and structure of the catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate that specifically adsorbed organic additives (theophylline derivatives) could enhance the intrinsic HOR/HER activity in base on polycrystalline Pt by up to a factor of 3 via introducing weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, as confirmed by in situ surface enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Optimal HOR/HER activity is achieved on a 7&#8208;n&#8208;butyltheophylline decorated Pt surface, which sufficiently disrupts the hydrogen bonding network in the double layer without depleting the interfacial water. This work demonstrates the promise of electrochemical interfacial engineering as a strategy to boost electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>An Organic Laser Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Local Excited State Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material that achieves thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties from the local excited (LE) state is confirmed. The emission dominated by LE states leads to aggregation induced emission (AIE) in single crystal organic microwires. This result expands the way to realize electric driving laser by using aggregation induced TADF (AI&#8208;TADF) material as gain medium.







Abstract
The spatial separation between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) in thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecules leads to charge transfer (CT) states, which degrade the oscillator strength of emission transition and sacrifices high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), together limiting its application in organic solid&#8208;state lasers (OSSLs). Here, we demonstrated organic microwire lasers from TADF emitters that combine aggregation induced emission (AIE) and local excited (LE) state characteristics. The unique AIE and LE feature lead to a PLQY approaching 50&#8201;% and a high optical gain of 870&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for TADF microwires. The regenerated singlet excitons by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process are conducive to population inversion. As a result, we demonstrated microwire lasers around 465&#8197;nm with a low threshold of 3.74&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Therefore, our work provides insight to design TADF materials for OSSLs.

         <title>Operando Quantified Lithium Plating Determination Enabled by Dynamic Capacitance Measurement in Working Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operando quantified detection method enabled by dynamic capacitance measurement (DCM) is proposed for working batteries without extra equipment and sensors. An upward trend of capacitance can be observed once the Li plating occurs, which determines the onset of Li plating.







Abstract
The access to full performance of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by the mysterious lithium plating behavior. A rapid quantified lithium plating determination method compatible with actual working conditions is an urgent necessity for safe working LIBs. In this contribution, the relationship between electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of graphite anodes during the Li&#8208;ion intercalation and Li plating processes is unveiled. We propose an operando lithium plating determination method based on the dynamic capacitance measurement (DCM) test. Reasonable selection of alternating current (AC) frequency protects the anodic responses from the interference of cathodic responses, which allows DCM to be applied in practical LIBs. The onset of lithium plating can be quantitatively traced, demonstrating the promise for real&#8208;time operando determination for lithium plating in a working battery.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction Enhanced by Oxygen Vacancies in Pt&#8208;loaded Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Oxide Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we create and stabilize oxygen vacancies in the Pt&#8208;loaded porous single crystalline molybdenum oxide monolith and demonstrate efficient and durable low temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction.







Abstract
Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction at low temperature plays an important role in hydrogen production from fossil fuels and hydrogen purification for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the activation of H2O is a critical reaction step that greatly limits the overall performance during WGS reaction. Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) MoO3 monoliths at 1&#8197;cm scale and deposit atomic&#8208;layered Pt clusters at the lattice surface to create the interfacial system toward the low&#8208;temperature WGS reaction. The single&#8208;crystalline nature stabilizes the oxygen vacancies (VO) at lattice and facilitates the effective activation of H2O at the interface. We show the highest Pt&#8208;normalized activity of 0.86&#8197;molCO&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the ultra&#8208;low temperature WGS reaction at 120&#8201;&#176;C. The single&#8208;crystalline features with enhanced fluxion in porous architectures lead to outstanding performance without visible degradation even after continuous operation for 100&#8197;hours.

         <title>Semiconducting Copolymers with Naphthalene Imide/Amide &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Units: Synthesis, Crystallography, and Systematic Structure&#8208;Property&#8208;Mobility Correlations</title>

The effects of electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl (C=O) group deletion on the naphthaleneimide unit from 4C=O in NDI to 3C=O in NBL to 2C=O in NBA on charge transport and structure&#8208;property correlations are systematically investigated.







Abstract
In a series of n&#8208;type semiconducting naphthalene tetracarboxydiimide (NDI)&#8208;dithiophene (T2) copolymers, structural and electronic properties trends are systematically evaluated as the number of NDI carbonyl groups is reduced from 4 in NDI to 3 in NBL (1&#8208;amino&#8208;4,5&#8208;8&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;tricarboxylic acid&#8208;1,8&#8208;lactam&#8208;4,5&#8208;imide) to 2 in NBA (naphthalene&#8208;bis(4,8&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarboxyl)&#8208;amide). As the NDI&#8208;T2 backbone torsional angle falls the LUMO energy rises. However, the thienyl attachment regiochemistry also plays an important role in less symmetric NBL and NBA. Electron mobility is greatest for N2200 (0.17&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) followed by PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2 and PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 (0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2, and negligible in PNBA&#8208;3,7&#8208;T2. Charge transport reflects a delicate balance between electronic backbone communication (optimum for N2200 and PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2), backbone planarity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2), LUMO energy (optimum for N2200), &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2), and film crystallinity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and N2200). These results offer generalizable insight into semiconducting copolymer design.

         <title>Encoding Morphogenesis of Quasi&#8208;Triangular Gold Nanoprisms with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, thiol&#8208;DNA (HS&#8208;DNA) is employed to protect transient quasi&#8208;nanoprisms, so as to improve their stability in different microenvironments and facilitate the study of their plasmonic properties. These quasi&#8208;nanoprisms&#8208;DNA complexes can not only form the user&#8208;defined programmable self&#8208;assembly structures but act as microplatforms to encode and decode barcode&#8208;like orthogonal information, which extends their applications in nanophotonics.







Abstract
Properties of gold nanoparticles vary with their morphologies. Typically, the research on the properties and applications of the nonequilibrium intermediates generated by the morphological evolution of triangular gold nanoprisms is still incomplete. Herein, we employ thiol&#8208;DNA (HS&#8208;DNA) to protect the low&#8208;stability quasi&#8208;nanoprisms with different truncation degrees (R values). The presence of HS&#8208;DNA not only increases the stability of the quasi&#8208;nanoprisms in different microenvironments, but also facilitates us to investigate their intrinsic plasmonic properties related to morphology. Additionally, we serve quasi&#8208;nanoprisms loaded with HS&#8208;DNA as assembly modules and nanoplatforms for programmable self&#8208;assembly higher&#8208;order hybrid structures, as well as carriers for encoding and decoding of orthogonal barcode&#8208;like information, which opens new opportunities for developing novel building blocks for light manipulation at nanoscale.

         <title>Manipulating Reaction Intermediates to Aqueous&#8208;Phase ZnSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters and Quantum Dots at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the prenucleation stage of aqueous&#8208;phase ZnSe quantum dots (QDs), an optically&#8208;transparent intermediate forms, which can transform to absorbing magic&#8208;size clusters (MSC&#8208;299). The MSC precursor compound (PC&#8208;299) fragments passively when a room&#8208;temperature reaction proceeds beyond nucleation, while aggressively at elevated temperatures. High reaction concentrations favor the PC&#8208;299 formation more.







Abstract
It is not resolved which model describes better the aqueous&#8208;phase nucleation and growth of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), the classical one&#8208;step one or the nonclassical multi&#8208;step one. Here, we design a room&#8208;temperature reaction to trap reaction intermediates in the prenucleation stage of ZnSe QDs (as a model system). We show that the trapped intermediate can transform to magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) via intra&#8208;molecular reorganization and can fragment to enable the growth of QDs. The MSCs exhibit a sharp optical absorption peaking at 299&#8197;nm, labelled MSC&#8208;299. The intermediate, the precursor compound (PC&#8208;299) of MSC&#8208;299, is optically transparent at 299&#8197;nm and to longer wavelengths. This intermediate forms in various Zn and Se reaction systems. The present study provides unambiguous evidence that the nonclassical and classical pathways are both necessary to explain the nucleation and growth of aqueous&#8208;phase QDs, with the former pathway favored more by high reaction concentrations.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Construction of Vicinal All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters via Iridium/Europium Bimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Ir/Eu dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction has been developed by makig use of challenging trisubstituted allylic esters and nucleophilic C3&#8208;substituted oxindole derivatives. A variety of allylated products bearing vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters could be obtained in good yields with high to excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters is a formidable task. We here report a synergistic bimetallic catalysis via a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;europium (Eu) complex and a phosphoramidite&#8208;iridium (Ir) catalyst for the asymmetric allylation of oxindole derivatives by using challenging trisubstituted allylic esters. The allylated products bearing vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters were obtained with good diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Control experiments showed that the complementary diastereomers of the products were not accessible by the change of the stereochemistry of the chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide ligand.

         <title>Zeolite NPO&#8208;Type Azolate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle for obtaining zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with an underlying NPO built from three&#8208;membered rings (3&#8208;rings) is reported. Among the hundreds of unique ZIFs known, only a few have been discovered that are partially constructed from 3&#8208;ring motifs. These findings provide a significant addition to the limited library of ZIF design principles to access attractive structural features for realizing practical function.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered rings (3&#8208;rings) are an important structural motif in zeolite chemistry, but their formation remains serendipitous in reticular chemistry when designing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Herein, we report a design principle for constructing four new ZIFs, termed ZIF&#8208;1001 to &#8208;1004, from tetrahedral ZnII centers (T), benzotriazolate (bTZ), and different functionalized benzimidazolates (RbIM) that adopt a new zeolite NPO&#8208;type topology built from 3&#8208;rings. Two factors were critical for this discovery: i)&#8197;incorporating the bTZ linker within the structures formed 3&#8208;rings due to a &#8736;(T&#8722;bTZ&#8722;T) angle of 120&#8211;130&#176; reminiscent of the &#8736;(Ge&#8722;O&#8722;Ge) angle (130&#176;) observed in germanate zeolite&#8208;type structures having 3&#8208;rings; and ii)&#8197;RbIM guided the coordination chemistry of bTZ to bind preferentially in an imidazolate&#8208;type mode. This series&#8217; ability to selectively capture CO2 from high&#8208;humidity flue gas and trap ethane from tail gas during shale gas extraction was demonstrated.

A new type of nitrogen&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold with a unique combination of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings and appealing properties was synthesized through 3&#8208;fold oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of tri(1&#8208;naphthyl)amine.

Abstract
We describe a new type of nitrogen&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold comprising a unique combination of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings. The compound is accessible through an intramolecular oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of tri(1&#8208;naphthyl)amine. To the best of our knowledge this is the very first example of a direct 3&#8208;fold cyclization of a triarylamine under oxidative conditions. The unusual ring fusion motif is confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and the impact of cyclization on the electronic and photophysical properties is investigated both experimentally and theoretically based on density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation of the unexpected product is rationalized by detailed mechanistic studies on the DFT level. The results suggest the cyclization to occur under kinetic control via a dicationic mechanism.

The compound is accessible through an intramolecular oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of tri(1-naphthyl)amine. To the best of our knowledge this is the very first example of a direct 3-fold cyclization of a triarylamine under oxidative conditions. The unusual ring fusion motif is confirmed by X-ray crystallography and the impact of cyclization on the electronic and photophysical properties is investigated both experimentally and theoretically based on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation of the unexpected product is rationalized by detailed mechanistic studies on the DFT level. The results suggest the cyclization to occur under kinetic control via a dicationic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
New D2h symmetric porphyrin hole&#8208;transporting materials were synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. The best device based on MDA4 with two diphenylamino groups directly attached to the porphyrin core exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 22.67&#8201;% (certified value of 22.19&#8201;%) with exceptional thermal stability. The novel strategy paves the way for efficient and stable PSCs with porphyrin HTMs.







Abstract
A series of new D2h symmetric porphyrins (MDA4, MTA4, and MDA8) with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structures have been synthesized as the hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The novel porphyrin molecules feature a D2h symmetrically substituted ZnII porphyrin core and two kinds of donor systems (diarylamine (DAA) and triarylamine (TAA)), which can regulate energy level, increase thermal stability, solubility, and hydrophobicity via long alkoxyl chains. PSC devices based on MDA4 as the HTM showed impressive power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.67&#8201;% under AM1.5G solar illumination. Notably, the device was sent for certification, and a PCE of 22.19&#8201;% was reported, representing the highest PCE from porphyrin&#8208;based HTMs. Furthermore, the MDA4&#8208;based PSCs showed excellent thermal stability under 60&#8201;&#176;C and RH 60&#8201;% and preserved 88&#8201;% of initial performance after 360&#8197;hours. The strategy opens a new avenue for developing efficient and stable porphyrin HTMs for PSCs.

         <title>Competitive Adsorption: Reducing the Poisoning Effect of Adsorbed Hydroxyl on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Site with SnO2 for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C elecotrocatalyst with low OHad poisoning effect to Ru sites was demonstrated by the competition adsorption strategy. It exhibited excellent HER activity owing to the fast OHad transfer process (OHad+e&#8722;&#8651;OH&#8722;, the key step of Vomer step), which alleviated the poisoning of OHad on Ru sites and facilitate regeneration of Ru active sites.







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) has been theoretically considered a viable alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst due to its fast water dissociation kinetics. However, its strong affinity to the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) blocks the active sites, resulting in unsatisfactory performance during the practical HER process. Here, we first reported a competitive adsorption strategy for the construction of SnO2 nanoparticles doped with Ru single&#8208;atoms supported on carbon (Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C) via atomic galvanic replacement. SnO2 was introduced to regulate the strong interaction between Ru and OHad by the competitive adsorption of OHad between Ru and SnO2, which alleviated the poisoning of Ru sites. As a consequence, the Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C exhibited a low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (10&#8197;mV) and a low Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This approach provides a new avenue to modulate the adsorption strength of active sites and intermediates, which paves the way for the development of highly active electrocatalysts.

         <title>Directly Imaging Dynamic Electronic Coupling during Electrochemical Oxidation of Single Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
During electrochemical oxidation processes, a dip behavior for single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrodes is directly visualized using a monochromatic bright field imaging technique. This observation can be attributed to interfacial Au&#8722;Ag electronic coupling interactions, which are manifested as the heterogeneity of electrochemical activity of individual Ag nanoparticles.







Abstract
The electronic coupling between a metal electrode and single nano&#8208;entities is of unfading significance which impacts the heterogeneous electron transfer. Herein, we demonstrated a simple optical technique for directly imaging the transient interfacial electronic coupling events during electrochemical oxidation of single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrode. The electronic coupling brings out a dramatic dip behavior of bright field imaging traces, and is conductive to cross the energy barrier of oxidation for single silver nanoparticles. This dip behavior is further verified by in situ vis&#8208;transmission spectroscopy, and the heterogeneity of the Au&#8722;Ag electronic coupling down to single&#8208;nanoparticle level is uncovered by unifying the morphology and size of individual silver nanoparticles. These results suggest the interfacial electronic coupling facilitates electron transfer of single nanoparticles, and provide important insight into understanding detailed mechanism of nanoelectrochemistry.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Barium Hydride Mediates Dinitrogen Fixation and Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free barium hydride has been demonstrated to mediate nitrogen fixation and ammonia synthesis via a chemical looping route. The creation of hydrogen vacancies plays a crucial role in the activation and hydrogenation of N2 to NH3.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated dinitrogen fixation has been intensively investigated. The employment of main group elements for this vital reaction has recently sparked interest because of new dinitrogen reaction chemistry. We report ammonia synthesis via a chemical looping process mediated by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free barium hydride (BaH2). Experimental and computational studies reveal that the introduction of hydrogen vacancies is essential for creating multiple coordinatively unsaturated Ba sites for N2 activation. The adjacent lattice hydridic hydrogen (H&#8722;) then undergoes both reductive elimination and reductive protonation to convert N2 to NHx. The ammonia production rate supports this hydride&#8208;vacancy mechanism via a chemical looping route that far exceeds that of a catalytic process. The BaH2&#8208;mediated chemical looping process has prospects in future technologies for ammonia synthesis using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 9&#8208;fluorenylidene&#8208;substituted expanded radialenes with a diacetylene spacer were synthesized. The neutral compounds are cross&#8208;conjugated but their dianions are stabilized by the aromaticity of the central cores and fluorenyl anion substituents. The larger sized macrocyclic dianions exhibited unique open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
Radialenes and expanded radialenes are cross&#8208;conjugated macrocycles displaying poor aromatic character. In this work, three 9&#8208;fluorenylidene substituted expanded [n]radialenes (ER&#8208;n, n=3&#8211;5) with a diacetylene spacer were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and NMR spectroscopy. They all can be easily reduced into relatively stable dianions. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that their dianions (ER&#8208;n2&#8722;, n=3&#8211;5) are stabilized by both the aromatic fluorenyl anion substituents and the central aromatic rings with formally [4n+2] delocalized &#960; electrons. In addition, the dianions of the extended radialenes (ER&#8208;42&#8722; and ER&#8208;52&#8722;) show unique open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. For comparison, their linear counterparts (L&#8208;3 and L&#8208;4) were also synthesized; their dianions exhibit very different redox and optical properties from their respective macrocycles.

         <title>Calcination&#8208;regulated Microstructures of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymers towards Enhanced and Stable Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous nanorod&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor polymer with efficient and stable photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production in pure water is synthesized via a simple strategy of supramolecular chemistry combined with subsequent calcination treatment. The excellent performance could be attributed to the achievement of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction and two&#8208;electron water oxidation and the improvement of exciton splitting, O2 adsorption and activation.







Abstract
Regulating molecular structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymer is a promising strategy to improve photoactivity. Herein, a porous nanorod&#8208;like D&#8208;A polymer is synthesized via a strategy of supramolecular chemistry combined with subsequent calcination treatment. This polymer consists of benzene rings (D) and triazine (A) that are linked by amido bond (&#8722;CONH&#8722;). &#8722;CONH&#8722; further partially cracks into cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) (A) under calcination. The ratio of benzene to triazine could be tuned to adjust the &#8722;C&#8801;N content by varying the calcination atmosphere. Such regulation of molecular structure could modulate the band structure of D&#8208;A polymer and endow it with unique porous nanorod&#8208;like morphology, leading to the achievement of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction and two&#8208;electron water oxidation and the improvement of exciton splitting, O2 adsorption and activation. These merits synergistically ensure a highly efficient and stable photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Atropisomers with Vicinal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Diaxes by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective C&#8722;H Annulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step construction of atropisomers with vicinal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N chiral diaxes by cyclopentadiene (Cp)&#8208;free cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective C&#8722;H annulation with decent stereocontrols (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and 70/1 dr) was reported. Atropisomerization experiments and DFT calculations are done to study the rotational barriers and pathways of the diaxes.







Abstract
The atroposelective synthesis of atropisomers with vicinal diaxes remains rare and challenging, due to the steric influence between the two axes and their unique topology. Herein, we disclose a single&#8208;step construction of atropisomers with vicinal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N chiral diaxes by cyclopentadiene (Cp)&#8208;free cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective C&#8722;H annulation, providing the desired diaxial atropisomers of unique structures with decent stereocontrols of both axes (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and 70&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The optically pure products bearing fluorophores show circular polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, being candidate materials for potential CPL applications. Atropisomerization experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to study the rotational barriers and rotation pathways of the diaxes.

Realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is highly desirable in chemistry and materials science. In their Research Article (e202208735), Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers report highly efficient and direct ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescence from transparent MOF glasses that were made by a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. This work provides an alternative way to synthesize new MOF glasses with highly efficient utilization of triplet excitons and extends the function of color&#8208;tunable ultralong RTP into advanced photonic applications.

A novel hybrid material that mimics NAD(P)H oxidase was designed and tested for the in&#8197;situ regeneration of assorted enzyme cofactors, as reported by Ana Beloqui and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202206926). This material was fabricated by the controlled assembly of glucose oxidase and hemin catalysts supported by a functional nanogel that allocates the (bio)catalysts in different compartments. The synthesis procedure allows for the fabrication of heterogeneous nanoreactors that were proven to be very effective for the in&#8197;situ regeneration of natural and artificial enzyme cofactors.

Switchable templated polymerization is reported by Bas&#8197;G.&#8197;P. van&#8197;Ravensteijn, Ilja&#8197;K. Voets et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202206780), as illustrated in the cover picture. The green and grey sections represent the high (green) and low (grey) pH conditions under which the template is switched OFF and ON, respectively. In the OFF state, monomers and growing polymers are not attracted to the template, preventing any monomer conversion. In the ON state, monomers are drawn to the template, facilitating their polymerization. The forming polymers and templates assemble into micellar structures, of which one is highlighted in the middle of the cover.

         <title>Cascades of Evolved Enzymes for the Synthesis of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of enzymes in multistep reaction cascades offers new opportunities for drug synthesis and is often shorter than their chemical synthesis routes, thus supporting the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently, several cascades with evolved enzymes have been developed that have led to efficient synthetic pathways for highly complex molecules, thus pushing biocatalysis to a new level.







Abstract
Thanks to advances in enzyme discovery and protein engineering combined with the development of enzymatic multistep reaction cascades, new efficient routes for drug synthesis have been created that are superior to chemical syntheses. This supports the goal of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to move to more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently described outstanding examples include the biocatalytic cascade syntheses of the cyclic dinucleotide MK&#8208;1454, molnupiravir, and islatravir, as well as the efficient fixation of CO2 to make starch using an artificial enzyme cascade.

This supports the goal of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to move to more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes. Recently described outstanding examples include the biocatalytic cascade syntheses of the cyclic dinucleotide MK-1454, molnupiravir, and islatravir, as well as the efficient fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to make starch using an artificial enzyme cascade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Task&#8208;Specific Janus Materials in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the application of nano&#8208; and microstructured Janus materials, which are a new generation of heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions. Such materials can act as catalysts for reduction, oxidative desulfurization, dye degradation, asymmetric catalysis, biomass transformation, cascade reactions, oxidation, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, and gas&#8208;phase reactions.







Abstract
Janus materials are anisotropic nano&#8208; and microarchitectures with two different faces consisting of distinguishable or opposite physicochemical properties. In parallel with the discovery of new methods for the fabrication of these materials, decisive progress has been made in their application, for example, in biological science, catalysis, pharmaceuticals, and, more recently, in battery technology. This Minireview systematically covers recent and significant achievements in the application of task&#8208;specific Janus nanomaterials as heterogeneous catalysts in various types of chemical reactions, including reduction, oxidative desulfurization and dye degradation, asymmetric catalysis, biomass transformation, cascade reactions, oxidation, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, as well as gas&#8208;phase reactions. Finally, an outlook on possible future applications is given.

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the impact of the microenvironment, including the catalyst surface, substrate, co&#8208;reactants, electrolyte, membrane, and reactor, on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Different microenvironmental factors are discussed in the context of industrial applications, including coupling of CO2RR to carbon capture and conversion.







Abstract
Rather than just focusing on the catalyst itself in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), as previously reviewed elsewhere, we herein extend the discussion to the special topic of the microenvironment around the electrocatalytic center and present a comprehensive overview of recent research progress. We categorize the microenvironment based on the components relevant to electrocatalytic active sites, i.e., the catalyst surface, substrate, co&#8208;reactants, electrolyte, membrane, and reactor. Supported by most of the reported articles, the relevant factors affecting the catalytic performance of eCO2RR are then discussed in detail, and existing challenges and potential solutions are mentioned. Perspectives for the future research on eCO2RR, including the integration of different microenvironment factors, the extension to industrial application by coupling with carbon capture and conversion, and separation of products, are also discussed.

         <title>Non&#8208;Immunosuppressive Cyclophilin Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophilins are enzymes that accelerate the rotation of the peptide bond in front of a proline residue. As a consequence of their involvement in pathophysiological processes, they are associated with various diseases. Thus, the inhibition of cyclophilins appears to be a worthwhile goal, whose pursuit has led to various promising drug candidates&#8212;particularly for the treatment of viral infections&#8212;without contraproductive immunosuppression.







Abstract
Cyclophilins, enzymes with peptidyl&#8208;prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity, are relevant to a large variety of biological processes. The most abundant member of this enzyme family, cyclophilin A, is the cellular receptor of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA). As a consequence of the pathophysiological role of cyclophilins, particularly in viral infections, there is a broad interest in cyclophilin inhibition devoid of immunosuppressive activity. This Review first gives an introduction into the physiological and pathophysiological roles of cyclophilins. The presentation of non&#8208;immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors will commence with drugs based on chemical modifications of CsA. The naturally occurring macrocyclic sanglifehrins have become other lead structures for cyclophilin&#8208;inhibiting drugs. Finally, de&#8197;novo designed compounds, whose structures are not derived from or inspired by natural products, will be presented. Relevant synthetic concepts will be discussed, but the focus will also be on biochemical studies, structure&#8211;activity relationships, and clinical studies.

         <title>Heterosynthons, Solid Form Design and Enhanced Drug Bioavailability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>

The heterosynthon from the toolkit of the crystal engineer enables medicinal and pharmaceutical chemists to identify in the early stages of the design cycle those molecules whose solid forms are less likely to pose bioavailability issues.







Abstract
Starting from a molecular pharmacophore, which is a marker of drug action in medicinal molecules, we propose that the heterosynthon, a supramolecular synthon between unlike functional groups, plays an analogous role in the design and discovery of high bioavailability drugs. The heterosynthon could provide a more efficient and economical route to novel drugs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of Diverse Arenes Ortho to Small Alkyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionally rich and pharmaceutically relevant arene classes were shown to undergo site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation ortho to endocyclic methylene groups. These results suggest that there might be a tendency for C&#8722;H activation next to alkyl groups, which could be seen as a general selectivity mode for C&#8722;H activation. This site&#8208;selectivity appears to be distinct from more common sterically and electronically dominated selectivity modes.







Abstract
Catalytic systems for direct C&#8722;H activation of arenes commonly show preference for electronically activated and sterically exposed C&#8722;H sites. Here we show that a range of functionally rich and pharmaceutically relevant arene classes can undergo site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation ortho to small alkyl substituents, preferably endocyclic methylene groups. The C&#8722;H activation is experimentally supported as being the selectivity&#8208;determining step, while computational studies of the transition state models indicate the relevance of non&#8208;covalent interactions between the catalyst and the methylene group of the substrate. Our results suggest that preference for C(sp2)&#8722;H activation next to alkyl groups could be a general selectivity mode, distinct from common steric and electronic factors.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride, Alkenes and Diazo Compounds and Synthesis of Pentafluorosulfanylfurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component radical reaction of SF5Cl, alkenes, and diazo compounds for synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF5 carbonyl compounds was developed. Furthermore, the three&#8208;component adducts formed from SF5Cl, &#945;&#8208;diazoacetophenones and vinyl acetates were converted into pentafluorosulfanylfurans.







Abstract
We report herein the three&#8208;component radical addition reaction of SF5Cl, alkene and diazo compounds for the selective formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF5 carbonyl compounds. The three&#8208;component addition reaction proceeded through the first reaction of SF5 radical with the diazo compound followed by the addition of the in situ generated carbon radical to alkene. The synthetic useful &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF5 carbonyl compounds were successfully prepared when allyl trimethylsilanes were used as the alkene substrates. Furthermore, the three&#8208;component adducts formed from SF5Cl, &#945;&#8208;diazoacetophenones and vinyl acetates were converted into pentafluorosulfanylfurans. This transformation provided a practical and efficeint method for the synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylfurans.

         <title>Homogeneous Synthesis of Monodisperse Sequence&#8208;Defined Conjugated Oligomers by Temperature Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined macromolecules has been one of the ultimate goals and challenges for polymer chemists for decades. This work reports the first homogeneous synthesis of monodisperse sequence&#8208;defined conjugated oligomers. The synthesis is supported by catalyst transfer polymerization and a custom Python&#8208;based automated program.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined synthetic oligomers and polymers provide unprecedented opportunities for polymer chemists to finely control properties such as chain folding, self&#8208;assembly, and optoelectronic performance of materials. However, absolute control over both chain&#8208;length and monomer sequence has been a long&#8208;standing &#8220;grand challenge&#8221; for decades. Herein, we report a novel strategy to synthesize monodisperse sequence&#8208;defined conjugated oligomers in a homogeneous manner by temperature cycling, thereby achieving single&#8208;monomer precision in conjugated polyheterocycles. A series of sequence&#8208;defined oligomers with up to twelve repeating units, four different monomers, and various sequences were successfully synthesized. Monomer sequence was also proved to affect optical properties. We believe this strategy not only exhibits general applicability to the synthesis of group&#8197;16 conjugated oligomers and polymers, but also has far&#8208;reaching potential for other polymer systems.

         <title>Towards Hexagonal Planar Nickel: A Dispersion&#8208;Stabilised Tri&#8208;Lithium Nickelate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic tri&#8208;lithium nickelates can be readily prepared from simple precursors, but despite exhibiting a hexagonal planar geometry according to solid&#8208;state parameters, complementary bonding analysis reveals that the Li&#8722;Ni interactions are repulsive in nature. London dispersion interactions between the TMEDA donor and aryl&#8208;acetylide ligands are found to be crucial in the stabilisation and isolation of these complexes.







Abstract
Advancing the understanding of lithum nickelate complexes, here we report a family of homoleptic organonickelate complexes obtained by reacting Ni(COD)2 and lithium aryl&#8208;acetylides in the presence of the bidentate donor TMEDA. These compounds represent rare examples of low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metals supported solely by organolithium ligands. Whilst the solid&#8208;state structures indicate a hexagonal planar geometry around Ni0 with Ni&#8722;Li bonds, bonding analysis via QTAIM, NCI, NBO and ELI methods reveals that the Ni&#8722;Li interactions are repulsive in nature, characterising these complexes as tri&#8208;coordinated. London dispersion forces between TMEDA and the organic substituents on nickel are found to play a crucial role in the stabilisation and thus isolation of these complexes. Preliminary reactivity studies demonstrate that the homoleptic lithium nickelates undergo stoichiometric cross&#8208;coupling with PhI to give dinickel clusters containing both anionic acetylide and neutral alkyne ligands.

         <title>The Interaction of K and O2 on Au(111): Multiple Growth Modes of Potassium Oxide and Their Catalytic Activity for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different types of potassium oxides were observed on top of Au(111) at 300&#8211;525&#8197;K. Small aggregates of K2O2/K2O (1&#8211;2&#8197;nm in size) were seen at the elbows of the herringbone structure. After increasing the K coverage (&gt;0.15&#8197;ML), large islands of the oxide (20&#8211;40&#8197;nm in size) appeared with a mixture of K2O and KOy (y&lt;0.5). A key correlation was found involving the structure, oxidation state, and catalytic activity of the alkali oxide.







Abstract
In industrial catalysis, alkali cations are frequently used to promote activity or selectivity. Scanning tunneling microscopy, ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional calculations were used to study the structure and reactivity of potassium oxides in contact with the Au(111) surface. Three different types of oxides (K2O2, K2O and KOy with y&lt;0.5) were observed on top of the gold substrate at 300&#8211;525&#8197;K. Initially, small aggregates of K2O2/K2O (1&#8211;2&#8197;nm in size) were seen at the elbows of the herringbone structure. After increasing the K coverage (&gt;0.15&#8197;ML), large islands of the oxide (20&#8211;40&#8197;nm in size) appeared. These islands contained a mixture of K2O and KOy (y&lt;0.5). A key correlation was found involving the structure, oxidation state, and chemical activity of the alkali oxide. The small aggregates of potassium oxide had a very high catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO, being much more than plain promoters.

         <title>A Versatile Chemoenzymatic Nanoreactor that Mimics NAD(P)H Oxidase for the In Situ Regeneration of Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NanoNOx hybrids, consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) enzymes individually wrapped by a catalytic polymer, were designed for the glucose&#8208;mediated regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors. With this confined distribution, hydrogen peroxide generated in situ is injected into the organometallic catalyst, which is ultimately responsible for the oxidation of the cofactor. The system was successfully coupled to NAD&#8208;dependent enzymes.







Abstract
Herein, we report a multifunctional chemoenzymatic nanoreactor (NanoNOx) for the glucose&#8208;controlled regeneration of natural and artificial nicotinamide cofactors. NanoNOx are built of glucose oxidase&#8208;polymer hybrids that assemble in the presence of an organometallic catalyst: hemin. The design of the hybrid is optimized to increase the effectiveness and the directional channeling at low substrate concentration. Importantly, NanoNOx can be reutilized without affecting the catalytic properties, can show high stability in the presence of organic solvents, and can effectively oxidize assorted natural and artificial enzyme cofactors. Finally, the hybrid was successfully coupled with NADH&#8208;dependent dehydrogenases in one&#8208;pot reactions, using a strategy based on the sequential injection of a fuel, namely, glucose. Hence, this study describes the first example of a hybrid chemoenzymatic nanomaterial able to efficiently mimic NOx enzymes in cooperative one&#8208;pot cascade reactions.

NanoNOx are built of glucose oxidase-polymer hybrids that assemble in the presence of an organometallic catalyst: hemin. The design of the hybrid is optimized to increase the effectiveness and the directional channeling at low substrate concentration. Importantly, NanoNOx can be reutilized without affecting the catalytic properties, can show high stability in the presence of organic solvents, and can effectively oxidize assorted natural and artificial enzyme cofactors. Finally, the hybrid was successfully coupled with NADH-dependent dehydrogenases in one-pot reactions, using a strategy based on the sequential injection of a fuel, namely, glucose. Hence, this study describes the first example of a hybrid chemoenzymatic nanomaterial able to efficiently mimic NOx enzymes in cooperative one-pot cascade reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stibenium: Lewis Superacidity by Antimony(III)&#8208;Antimony(V) Electromerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the calix[4]pyrrolato stibenium cation is treated with pyridine, a Lewis&#8208;base coordination&#8208;induced electromerism transforms the low&#8208;affinity stibenium to a high&#8208;affinity stibonium state. The generated transient stibonium ion readily reacts with SbF6&#8722; and illustrates a Lewis superacid that can be triggered by electromerism.







Abstract
Lewis superacids enable the activation of highly inert substrates. However, the permanent presence of a Lewis superacidic center comes along with a constantly increased intolerance toward functional groups or ambient conditions. Herein, we describe a strategy to unleash Lewis superacidity by electromerism. Experimental and computational results indicate that coordinating a Lewis base to &#916;&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato&#8208;antimony(III) triggers a ligand redox&#8208;noninnocent coupled transfer into antimony(V)&#8208;state that exhibits Lewis superacidic features. Lewis acidity by electromerism establishes a concept of potential generality for powerful yet robust reagents and on&#8208;site substrate activation approaches.

         <title>Topochemical Synthesis of Ca3CrN3H Involving a Rotational Structural Transformation for Catalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topochemical synthesis route of a nitride hydride, h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H is reported. It is interesting to observe a rotational structural transformation in a nitride&#8208;based inorganic material. Furthermore, h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H exhibits catalytic ammonia synthesis activity despite the lack of Ru/Fe centers.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions have led to great progress in the discovery of new metastable compounds with novel chemical and physical properties. With these reactions, the overall crystal structure of the host material is generally maintained. Here we report a topochemical synthesis of a hexagonal nitride hydride, h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H, by heating an orthorhombic nitride, o&#8208;Ca3CrN3, under hydrogen at 673&#8197;K, accompanied by a rotational structural transformation. The hydrogen intercalation modifies the Ca&#8722;N rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like atomic packing in o&#8208;Ca3CrN3 to a face&#8208;sharing octahedral chain in h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H, mimicking a &#8220;hinged tessellation&#8221; movement. In addition, the h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H exhibited stable ammonia synthesis activity when used as a catalyst.

         <title>A Chemically Recyclable Crosslinked Polymer Network Enabled by Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining two types of dynamic covalent chemistries within a single network enables a chemically recyclable crosslinked material with excellent mechanical performances. Virgin&#8208;quality monomers can be recovered and reused by efficient depolymerization under mild conditions.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of synthetic polymers offers a solution for developing sustainable plastics and materials. Here we show that two types of dynamic covalent chemistry can be orthogonalized in a solvent&#8208;free polymer network and thus enable a chemically recyclable crosslinked material. Using a simple acylhydrazine&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dithiolane as the starting material, the disulfide&#8208;mediated reversible polymerization and acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent crosslinking can be combined in a one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;free reaction, resulting in mechanically robust, tough, and processable crosslinked materials. The dynamic covalent bonds in both backbones and crosslinkers endow the network with depolymerization capability under mild conditions and, importantly, virgin&#8208;quality monomers can be recovered and separated. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study show opportunities to design chemically recyclable materials based on the dynamic chemistry toolbox.

         <title>Diastereoselective, Catalytic Access to Cross&#8208;Aldol Products Directly from Esters and Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique, catalytic method has been developed to directly access aldol&#8208;type products from esters and lactones. Using borane catalysis and transborylation as the turnover mechanism, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;aldol&#8208;type products were selectively obtained in excellent yield and stereoselectivity across a range of functionalised substrates, including bioactive natural and unnatural products.







Abstract
High oxidation&#8208;state carbonyl coupling partners including esters and lactones were reacted with enones to give aldol&#8208;type products directly using two&#8208;fold organoborane catalysis. This new retrosynthetic disconnection to aldol&#8208;type products is compatible with enolisable coupling partners, without self&#8208;condensation, and couples the high reactivity of secondary dialkylboranes with the stability of pinacolboronic esters. Excellent chemoselectivity, substrate scope (including those containing reducible functionalities and free alcohols) and diastereocontrol were achieved to access both the syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;aldol&#8208;type products. Mechanistic studies confirmed the two&#8208;fold catalytic role of the single secondary borane catalyst for boron enolate formation and formation of an aldehyde surrogate from the ester or lactone coupling partner.

         <title>Successive Redox&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Triggered Interface Radical Polymerization for Growing Hydrogel Coatings on Diverse Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface modification method without UV assistance is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto diverse substrates regardless of material size, geometry, and transparency. This strategy takes advantage of the synergy among the catechol adhesion mechanism, coordination to metal ions and its unique redox reactivity for interface polymerization, providing a simple and universal route for surface modification.







Abstract
Growing lubricating hydrogel coatings in controllable manners on diverse material surfaces demonstrates promising applications. Here, a surface modification method is reported for in situ growing hydrogel coatings onto surfaces of diverse substrates in the absence of UV assistance. It is performed by decorating substrates with a universal mussel&#8208;inspired synthetic adhesive with catechol groups. Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in situ capture and reduce Fe3+ into Fe2+ for decomposing S2O82&#8722; into SO4&#8722;&#8901; catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.

Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in situ capture and reduce Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; into Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for decomposing S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901; catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstonlarsine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective total synthesis of alkaloid (+)&#8208;alstonlarsine A is reported. The key step is a domino sequence comprising enamine formation and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The developed methodology for indole C(2)&#8208;H carbenoid insertion enabled closure of the 7&#8208;membered ring via intramolecular Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons reaction. This approach allowed for the synthesis of other scaffolds containing an indole ring fused to 6&#8208;,7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered rings.







Abstract
An enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstonlarsine A (1), a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid possessing a unique pentacyclic skeleton as well as a rare biological activity, is achieved. The key step is an efficient domino sequence, comprising enamine formation followed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand intramolecular dearomative Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition for the construction of 9&#8208;azatricyclo[4.3.1.03,8]decane core. The key intermediate for this domino sequence was synthesized by a newly developed methodology, relying on indole C(2)&#8208;H bond functionalization, combined with intramolecular Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons reaction. This tactical combination offers a new general entry into other (privileged) tricyclic frameworks possessing indole ring fused to 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; or 8&#8208;membered rings.

We report &#945;&#8208;thianthrenium carbonyl species as &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation equivalents, generated in situ by radical conjugate addition of trifluoromethyl radical to Michael acceptors. The method can obtain C&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted amino acids in 90&#8197;seconds.







Abstract
Here we report an &#945;&#8208;thianthrenium carbonyl species, as the equivalent of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation, which is generated by the radical conjugate addition of a trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt to Michael acceptors. The reactivity allows for the synthesis of C&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid analogues via a Ritter reaction by addition of acetonitrile. Addition of hydroxide, methoxide, and even fluoride can afford &#945;&#8208;heteroatom substituted &#945;&#8208;phenylpropanoates.

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin for Bioactivity Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully stereocontrolled synthesis of the algae differentiation factor (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin was achieved by employing a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization and effective late&#8208;stage sp2&#8211;sp2&#8208;coupling using non&#8208;toxic reagents. Quantitative phenotype profiling in the alga Ulva mutabilis gave an EC50 of 4.8&#8197;pM. SAR investigations of derivatives uncovered two functionally distinct chemical mediator functions.







Abstract
Chemical mediators are key compounds for controlling symbiotic interactions in the environment. Here, we disclose a fully stereoselective total synthesis of the algae differentiation factor (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin that utilizes sophisticated 6&#8208;endo&#8208;cyclization chemistry and effective late&#8208;stage sp2&#8211;sp2&#8208;couplings using non&#8208;toxic reagents. An EC50 of 4.8&#8197;pM was determined by quantitative phenotype profiling in the green seaweed Ulva mutabilis (Chlorophyte), underscoring this potent mediator&#8216;s enormous, pan&#8208;species bioactivity produced by symbiotic bacteria. SAR investigations indicate that (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin triggers at least two different pathways in Ulva that may be separated by chemical editing of the mediator compound structure.

         <title>Membrane Manipulation of Giant Unilamellar Polymer Vesicles with a Temperature&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane manipulation of giant polymers using a temperature&#8208;responsive polymer is reported. The strategy makes it possible to develop materials and create compartmentalized systems that can mimic the adaptive properties of biomembranes.







Abstract
Understanding the complex behavior and dynamics of cellular membranes is integral to gain insight into cellular division and fusion processes. Bottom&#8208;up synthetic cells are as a platform for replicating and probing cellular behavior. Giant polymer vesicles are more robust than liposomal counterparts, as well as having a broad range of chemical functionalities. However, the stability of the membrane can prohibit dynamic processes such as membrane phase separation and division. Here, we present a method for manipulating the membrane of giant polymersomes using a temperature responsive polymer. Upon elevation of temperature deformation and phase separation of the membrane was observed. Upon cooling, the membrane relaxed and became homogeneous again, with infrequent division of the synthetic cells.

         <title>Oxalate Oxidase for In Situ H2O2&#8208;Generation in Unspecific Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Drug Oxyfunctionalisations
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput &#956;L&#8208;scale screenings revealed optimal conditions for in situ H2O2&#8208;generation using oxalate oxidase in bioconversions catalysed by unspecific peroxygenase. This enzymatic tandem exhibits extraordinary potential for selective C&#8722;H oxyfunctionalisation reactions of complex drug scaffolds.







Abstract
H2O2&#8208;driven enzymes are of great interest for industrial biotransformations. Herein, we show for the first time that oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an efficient in situ source of H2O2 for one of these biocatalysts, which is known as unspecific peroxygenase (UPO). OXO is reasonably robust, produces only CO2 as a by&#8208;product and uses oxalate as a cheap sacrificial electron donor. UPO has significant potential as an industrial catalyst for selective C&#8722;H oxyfunctionalisations, as we confirm herein by testing a diverse drug panel using miniaturised high&#8208;throughput assays and mass spectrometry. 33 out of 64 drugs were converted in 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8208;scale reactions by the UPO with OXO (conversion &gt;70&#8201;% for 11 drugs). Furthermore, oxidation of the drug tolmetin was achieved on a 50&#8197;mg scale (TONUPO 25&#8201;664) with 84&#8201;% yield, which was further improved via enzyme immobilization. This one&#8208;pot approach ensures adequate H2O2 levels, enabling rapid access to industrially relevant molecules that are difficult to obtain by other routes.

Herein, we show for the first time that oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an efficient in situ source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for one of these biocatalysts, which is known as unspecific peroxygenase (UPO). OXO is reasonably robust, produces only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a by-product and uses oxalate as a cheap sacrificial electron donor. UPO has significant potential as an industrial catalyst for selective C&#8722;H oxyfunctionalisations, as we confirm herein by testing a diverse drug panel using miniaturised high-throughput assays and mass spectrometry. 33 out of 64 drugs were converted in 5&#8197;&#956;L-scale reactions by the UPO with OXO (conversion &amp;gt;70&#8201;% for 11 drugs). Furthermore, oxidation of the drug tolmetin was achieved on a 50&#8197;mg scale (TON&lt;sub&gt;UPO&lt;/sub&gt; 25&#8201;664) with 84&#8201;% yield, which was further improved via enzyme immobilization. This one-pot approach ensures adequate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, enabling rapid access to industrially relevant molecules that are difficult to obtain by other routes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon Incorporated Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sp&#8208;carbon incorporated 2D c&#8208;MOF (Cu3HHAE2) single crystals are achieved based on the hexahydroxyarylene&#8208;ethynyl macrocycle ligand. Owing to the abundant acetylene units, Cu3HHAE2 acts as the first example of a MOF photocathode for highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increasing interest for broad applications in catalysis and gas separation due to their high porosity. However, the insulating feature and the limited active sites hindered MOFs as photocathode active materials for application in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, we develop a layered conductive two&#8208;dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c&#8208;MOF) comprising sp&#8208;carbon active sites based on arylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle ligand via CuO4 linking, named as Cu3HHAE2. This sp&#8208;carbon 2D c&#8208;MOF displays apparent semiconducting behavior and broad light absorption till the near&#8208;infrared band (1600&#8197;nm). Due to the abundant acetylene units, the Cu3HHAE2 could act as the first case of MOF photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation and presents a record hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of &#8776;260&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode among the structurally&#8208;defined cocatalyst&#8208;free organic photocathodes.

         <title>An Activatable and Reversible Virus&#8208;Mimicking NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe for Monitoring the Progression of Viral Encephalitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an activatable virus&#8208;mimicking NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe based on PbS quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated in a Fe2+&#8208;coordinating viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection, providing a favorable approach for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis.







Abstract
Viral encephalitis is an inflammatory disease of the brain parenchyma and caused by various viral infections. In vivo monitoring of the progression of viral infections can aid accurate diagnosis of viral encephalitis and effective intervention. We developed an activatable and reversible virus&#8208;mimicking near&#8208;infrared II nanoprobe consisting of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated, viral protein&#8208;decorated vesicle encapsulating PbS quantum dots with a 1300&#8197;nm fluorescence emission. The probe can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and monitor real&#8208;time changes in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations during viral infection by tuning the quenching level of quantum dots and regulating the fusion&#8211;fission behavior of vesicles via changes in Fe oxidation state. This switching strategy reduces background noise and improves detection sensitivity, making this nanoprobe a promising imaging agent for dynamic visualization of viral encephalitis and future clinical applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho(dicyano)methanide Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis of the cyapho(dicyano)methanide ion, [C(CN)2(CP)]&#8722;, by reaction of sodium phosphanide with (EtO)2C=C(CN)2. This species can be readily protonated at the methanide carbon atom to afford the parent acid, HC(CN)2(CP), which readily decomposes at room temperature. The reactivity of the cyaphide moiety was also probed by reaction with nucleophiles and in cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of a cyapho(dicyano)methanide salt, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][C(CN)2(CP)], from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with 1,1&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;dicyanoethylene (EtO)2C=C(CN)2. The reaction proceeds through a Michael addition&#8208;elimination pathway to afford [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][HP{C(OEt)=C(CN)2}]. Addition of a strong, non&#8208;nucleophilic base (KHMDS) to this intermediate results in the formation of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][C(CN)2(CP)]. Subsequent reactivity studies reveal that the cyapho(dicyano)methanide ion is susceptible to protonation with strong acids to afford the parent acid HC(CN)2(CP). The reactivity of the cyaphide moiety in [C(CN)2(CP)]&#8722; was explored through coordination to metal centers and in cycloaddition reactions with azides.

         <title>Enantioselective oxa&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Sequences of Dendralenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of target&#8208;relevant oxabicyclic systems is reported. The synthesis involves a sequence of two formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions between a wide variety of achiral dendralenes and a carbonyl dienophile, proceeding with the generation of two new rings, four new covalent bonds and up to four new stereocenters.







Abstract
Diene&#8208;transmissive hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder sequences involving carbonyl dienophiles are reported for the first time. High enantioselectivities are achieved in the reaction of phenylglyoxal with a broad range of dendralene structures, through the optimization of a Pd2+ catalyst system. The initial catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective oxa&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (ODA) cycloaddition to a [3]dendralene generates a dihydropyran carrying a semicyclic diene. This participates in a subsequent catalyst or substrate&#8208;controlled Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to generate sp3&#8208;rich fused polycyclic systems containing both heterocycles and carbocycles. Computational investigations reveal a concerted asynchronous mechanism. &#960;&#8208;Complexation of a diene C=C bond to Pd2+ occurs in both the pre&#8208;transition state (TS) complex and in cycloaddition TSs, controlling stereoselectivity. A formal enantioselective [4+2]cycloaddition of a CO2 dienophile is demonstrated.

         <title>A Switchable Palladium(II) Trefoil Entangled Tetrahedron with Temperature Dependence and Concentration Independence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A junctioned system has been developed that gives rise to a [Pd4(L)2]8+ trefoil entangled tetrahedron irrespective of the concentration. Heating the sample reversibly shifts the equilibrium from the knot to an isomeric non&#8208;interlocked dual metallocycle, thus demonstrating that thermodynamic equilibria can still be exploited for switching even in the absence of concentration effects.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly makes metallo&#8208;interlocked architectures attractive targets, but being in equilibrium with smaller species means that they can suffer from dilution effects. We show that a junctioned system gives rise to a [Pd4(L)2]8+ trefoil entangled tetrahedron irrespective of concentration. Heating the sample reversibly shifts the equilibrium from the knot to an isomeric non&#8208;interlocked dual metallo&#8208;cycle, demonstrating that thermodynamic equilibria can still be exploited for switching even in the absence of concentration effects.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylsulfenylation with a Disulfide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disulfide&#8208;based alkylthio transfer reagent was developed for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylsulfenylation of ketones and aldehydes, showing good activity and stereoselectivity when combined with primary amine organocatalysis.







Abstract
The use of alkylthio electrophiles in synthesis has remained elusive because of the lack of a suitable reagent that is practical and of excellent enantioselectivity and appropriate reactivity. In this work we introduce a novel alkylthio reagent based on the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MMTD) fragment for direct alkylsulfenylation of ketones and aldehydes. It can be readily prepared by the oxidative coupling between thiadiazole and other alkylthio reagents and be combined with chiral primary aminocatalysis. This protocol provides facile access to diverse &#945;&#8208;alkylthio quaternary carbon centers with good stereoselectivities.

         <title>Designing Quinone&#8208;Based Anodes with Rapid Kinetics for Rechargeable Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetramethylquinone (TMBQ) anode in acidic electrolyte exhibits high&#8208;rate capability (releases/stores 50&#8201;% theoretical capacity in 16&#8197;seconds) and fast kinetics, benefiting from continuous H+ migration channel, high proton diffusion coefficient (10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low proton migration barrier of 0.26&#8197;eV. When coupling with MnO2 cathode, the aqueous proton battery shows high power density of 20&#8201;000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and long cycle life of 4000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, which are capable of accommodating proton (H+), are emerging electrodes in aqueous batteries. However, the storage mechanism of proton in quinone compounds is less known and the energy/power density of quinone&#8208;based proton battery is still limited. Here we design a series of quinone anodes and study their electrochemical properties in acidic electrolyte, in which tetramethylquinone (TMBQ) delivers a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an extremely low polarization of 20&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;C, and maintains over 50&#8201;% theoretical capacity in less than 16&#8197;seconds. The fast kinetics of TMBQ is attributed to the continuous H+ migration channel, high H+ diffusion coefficient (10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1), and low H+ migration energy barrier (0.26&#8197;eV). When coupling with MnO2 cathode, the battery shows a long lifespan of 4000&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 77&#8201;% at 5&#8197;C. This study reveals the proton transport in quinone&#8208;electrodes and offers new insights to design advanced aqueous batteries.

         <title>A Conjugated Covalent Template Strategy for All&#8208;Benzene Catenane Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;free catenanes are synthetically non&#8208;trivial targets, and especially those composed of highly strained oligoparaphenylene&#8208;derived nanohoops. Herein, a novel conjugated covalent template strategy employing an azo group is established for an efficient synthesis of an all&#8208;benzene catenane. It features azobenzene&#8208;directed dual intramolecular macrocyclizations and traceless removal of the azo template.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules based on oligoparaphenylene&#8208;derived nanohoops, particularly those without heteroatoms, are synthetically challenging and topologically intriguing targets. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent template strategy based on azo group has been developed, which features dual intramolecular macrocyclizations directed by a tetra&#8208;substituted azobenzene core, followed by traceless removal of the azo linker. Employing this strategy, the efficient synthesis of a novel all&#8208;benzene [2]catenane consisting of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been accomplished.

         <title>Kinetic&#8208;Sieving of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene through a Novel Sulfonic Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 39, September 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fine&#8208;tuning of the pore structure without changing the topology is possible through post&#8208;synthetic heat treatment and gives the novel sulfonic anion&#8208;pillared hybrid ultramicroporous material ZU&#8208;610a. It achieves the kinetic sieving of C2H2 and CO2 which have the same kinetic diameter. It produces C2H2 with purity higher than 99.5&#8201;% in only one adsorption process.







Abstract
The engineering and tailoring of porous materials to realize the precise discrimination of CO2 and C2H2, with almost identical kinetic diameters, is a challenging task. We herein report the first example of the kinetic&#8208;sieving of relatively larger molecule of C2H2 from CO2 by a novel sulfonic anion&#8208;pillared hybrid ultramicroporous materials of ZU&#8208;610a. Specifically, ZU&#8208;610 constructed from copper(II), isonicotinic acid and 1,2&#8208;ethanedisulfonic acid is synthesized and shows the preferential affinity for C2H2 over CO2. After the post&#8208;synthetic heat treatment of ZU&#8208;610, ZU&#8208;610a with a contracted aperture is obtained. Interestingly, the C2H2&#8208;selctive ZU&#8208;610 was reversed to the CO2&#8208;selective ZU&#8208;610a. High purity C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) could be directly obtained from the dynamic breakthrough experiments on an equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixture at 298&#8197;K. This study provides guidance for the design of adsorbents aimed at separation systems with similar kinetic diameter.

High purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99.5&#8201;%) could be directly obtained from the dynamic breakthrough experiments on an equimolar C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture at 298&#8197;K. This study provides guidance for the design of adsorbents aimed at separation systems with similar kinetic diameter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating a Far&#8208;Red Fluorescent Probe with a Microfluidic Platform for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Erythrocyte Membrane Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC) membranes present rich ultrastructural and dynamic details, which rely on synchronous super&#8208;resolution imaging and tracking to unveil. Yet, it poses a serious challenge to achieve the dual functions in a single probe, due to the rigid and conflicting photophysical demands of different techniques. Herein, we rationally developed a far&#8208;red boron dipyrromethene membrane probe with blinking capability and consistent single&#8208;molecule emission, and constructed a microfluidic platform for noninvasive trapping and long&#8208;term imaging of RBCs. By combining them, multi&#8208;dimensional super&#8208;resolution reconstructions and single&#8208;molecule tracking were achieved at the molecular scale on living human RBC membranes in a high&#8208;throughput manner. Our integrated system defines a quantitative method for analyzing RBC membranes under physiological and pathological conditions, improving precisions and revealing new perspectives for future disease diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>19F Barcoding Enables Multiplex Detection of Biomarkers Associated with Organ Injury and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in complex environments is critical for the in&#8208;depth exploration of different biological processes, which is challenging for many current analytical methods due to various limitations. Herein, we report a strategy of 19F barcoding which takes the advantages of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output, and multiplex capacity. A set of 19F&#8208;barcoded sensors responding to different biomarkers involved in organ injury and cancer are designed, synthesized, and characterized. With these sensors, we accomplish concurrent assessment of different biomarkers in the samples collected from the mice with drug&#8208;induced liver/kidney injury or tumor, illustrating the feasibility of this approach for multiplexed detection of different biomarkers in complex environments during various biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Assembly of MOFs Colloidosomes for Bubble&#8208;Propelled Micromotors and Stirring&#8208;Free Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of MOF&#8208;based micromotors (MOFtors) is still challenging and with limited approaches, especially for the MOF nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we report a universal and straightforward strategy to efficiently self&#8208;assemble MOF NPs into robust MOFtors for enhanced organic or heavy metal ions contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring. Based on the transient Pickering emulsion method, Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Fe&#8208;UiO) NPs are rapidly self&#8208;assembled into Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 colloidosomes (Fe&#8208;UiOSomes) on a large scale, and the formation mechanism is systematically studied. The Fe&#8208;UiOSomes&#8208;Pt micromotors through chemical reduction (Micromotor&#8208;C) presented a higher moving ability of 450&#177;180 &#956;m s&#8208;1 in a 5 wt% H2O2 aqueous solution. Finally, the bubble&#8208;propelled Micromotor&#8208;C was employed to efficiently remove dyes and heavy metal ions (94% for MO and 91% for CrVI). Our simple fabrication strategy overcomes the current challenges and paves the way to design bubble&#8208;propelled MOFtors based on small&#8208;size MOF particles for stirring&#8208;free environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Stille Coupling/Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder Cascade for the Generation of Fused Pyridines and Application in the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Lycopladine A and (&#8722;)&#8208;Lycoposerramine R</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient asymmetric intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrones were combined with C3&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a tandem fashion. The resulting diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure cycloadducts were successfully converted into (+)&#8208;lycopladine A and lycoposerramine R.







Abstract
2&#8208;Pyrones with a chiral branched allylic silyl ether substituent underwent intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with remarkably high &#960;&#8208;facial&#8208; and endo&#8208;selectivities. The resulting diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure cycloadducts were transformed into the natural products (+)&#8208;lycopladine A and (&#8722;)&#8208;lycoposerramine R.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Functionalities for Modulating Surface Potentials in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but different functional groups ranging from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing on the pore channel were pre&#8208;designed as TENGs platform and further used to protect the cathodic current of carbon steel. Besides, the corresponding output performance of the COF&#8208;TENG to be precisely tuned through the transmit effects of surface sites to the polygonal backbones.







Abstract
Designing materials with high triboelectric is an efficient way of improving output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Herein, we synthesized a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but various functional groups ranging between electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing. These COFs form an ideal platform for clarifying the contribution of each group to TENG performance because the pore wall is perturbed in a predesigned manner. Kelvin probe force microscopy and computational data suggest that surface potentials and electron affinities of COFs can be improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, with the highest values observed for fluorinated COF. The TENG with fluorinated COF delivered an output voltage and current of 420&#8197;V and 64&#8197;&#956;A, respectively, which are comparable to other reported materials. This strategy can be used to efficiently screen suitable frameworks as TENG materials with excellent output performance.

         <title>An Inorganic Huisgen Reaction between a 1,2&#8208;Diboraallene and an Azide to Access a Diboratriazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the regioselective cycloaddition of 1,2&#8208;diboraallene with aryl azide, namely, Huisgen 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, affords an aromatic diboratriazole derivative. The diboratriazole readily releases N2 without the aid of any catalysts to furnish a 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative.







Abstract
Regioselective Huisgen cycloaddition reaction between 1,2&#8208;diboraallene and azide proceeds under catalyst&#8208;free and mild conditions to furnish a diboratriazole (2). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N3 five&#8208;membered ring of (2), indicating its aromatic features. Molecule (2) spontaneously releases N2 to form the 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative (3). The mechanism of a whole reaction profile was extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Chloride Ion Adsorption Enables Ampere&#8208;Level CO2 Electroreduction over Silver Hollow Fiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;coordination adsorbed Cl&#8722; on the surface of silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) not only suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction but also optimizes the kinetics of CO2 reduction to CO at ampere&#8208;level current density.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable feedstocks is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. However, it remains a challenge to possess a large current density, a high faradaic efficiency and excellent stability for practical applications of CO2 utilization. Herein, we report a facile tactic that enables exceedingly efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO by virtue of low&#8208;coordination chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption on a silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) electrode. A CO faradaic efficiency of 92.3&#8201;% at a current density of one ampere per square centimeter (1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 3.0&#8197;M KCl with a sustained performance observed during a 150&#8208;hour test was achieved, which is better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a low&#8208;coordination Cl&#8722; adsorption on surface of Ag HF, which not only suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also facilitated the CO2 reduction kinetics.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries via a Semi&#8208;Conductive Bipolar&#8208;Type Polymer Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) with a moderate electronic conductivity of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated as the cathode material for aqueous Zn battery. With the synergetic benefits of the semi&#8208;conductive nature and bipolar&#8208;type reaction of PDAN, the Zn//PDAN cell shows a promising capacity and a perfect cycle stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries have received considerable attention owing to their green, low&#8208;cost and high safe nature. Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (&#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and most of reported promising performances of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are achieved with a low mass&#8208;loading (&#8776;2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Herein, we demonstrate a semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar&#8208;type charge storage mechanism. Accordingly, the Zn//PDAN cell exhibits a promising capacity (140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a remarkable cycle stability (1000 cycles without capacity fading) at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These encouraging results shed light on the design of advanced organic electrode.

         <title>Fluorination Treatment of Conjugated Protonated Polyanilines for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation can get electrochemical performance improved by introducing functional groups. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PANI&#8208;H+/CNT organic composite cathode via fluoridized treatment provides a capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for PF6&#8722; storage, which may facilitate sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries with long cycle life and stable energy/power outputs.







Abstract
The overall performance of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized&#8208;polyaniline&#8208;H+/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high&#8208;efficiency PF6&#8722; storage. F&#8722; in PF6&#8722; is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8722;NH&#8722; in FPHC, so that PF6&#8722; can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) (310&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1/7720&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Besides, the relative pouch&#8208;type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers with extended &#960;-conjugation can get electrochemical performance improved by introducing functional groups. A proof-of-concept PANI-H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CNT organic composite cathode via fluoridized treatment provides a capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; storage, which may facilitate sodium dual-ion batteries with long cycle life and stable energy/power outputs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall performance of dual-ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized-polyaniline-H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high-efficiency PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; storage. F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8722;NH&#8722; in FPHC, so that PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) (310&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/7720&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Besides, the relative pouch-type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up-and-coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Conjugation of Aptamers on a Carbon Fiber Microelectrode Enables Highly Stable and Selective In&#8197;Vivo Neurosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and simple approach to interface aptamers with implantable electrodes for in&#8197;vivo sensing is reported. The strategy employs direct electrochemical conjugation to couple aptamers onto carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes (CFEs) with high controllability, efficiency, and stability. The covalent linkage improves the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, thereby allowing the continuous in&#8197;vivo probing of dopamine (DA) dynamics in the brain.







Abstract
Interfacing aptamers with carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) provides a versatile platform to probe the chemical activity in a living brain at the molecular level. However, new approaches are needed for the efficient and stable modification of electrode surfaces with aptamers. Here, we present an electrochemical conjugation strategy to covalently couple aptamers onto CFEs with high chemoselectivity, efficiency, and stability for sensing in the brain. The strategy employs an initial electrochemical coupling of catechol on an CFE, thereby generating a thin layer of quinone intermediates that couple rapidly with thiol&#8208;containing oligonucleotides under a controlled potential. This approach dramatically simplifies and improves the efficiency for modifying carbon surfaces, thereby allowing direct conjugation of high levels of aptamers on CFEs within 5&#8197;minutes. Importantly, the covalent linkage between the aptamers and carbon surfaces enables a greatly improved sensitivity and stability for the sensing of dopamine, offering a robust system for continuously probing dopamine dynamics in the living brains of animals.

Abstract

Asymmetric synthesis of structurally similar chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/aryl C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction is described.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Zn&#8208;S Batteries in Aqueous Media Through Cosolvent&#8208;Catalyst Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible Zn&#8722;S chemistry in aqueous media is realized by introducing tetraglyme cosolvent and iodine catalyst. The cosolvent&#8208;catalyst synergy can not only activate the polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple for S conversion but also generate an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase on Zn in situ, thus resulting in boosted cathode activity and anode stability. The strategy presents a new paradigm to stabilize aqueous Zn&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery with high energy density represents a promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, but its application is severely hindered by the poor reversibility of both S cathode and Zn anode. Herein, we develop a &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte containing tetraglyme (G4) and water as co&#8208;solvents and I2 as additive. The G4&#8208;I2 synergy could activate efficient polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple and shield the cathode from water, thus facilitating the conversion kinetics of S and suppressing the interfacial side reactions. Simultaneously, it could stabilize Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase upon cycling. With boosted electrodes reversibility, the Zn&#8722;S cell delivers a high capacity of 775&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and retains over 70&#8201;% capacity after 600 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The advances can also be readily generalized to other ethers/water hybrid electrolytes, showing the universality of the &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte design strategy.

Abstract
[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion (3) and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species (4). Compound (4) is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 gas under the mild reaction condition to generate an ion&#8208;separated species 5. An X&#8208;ray study shows that the anionic part of 5 bears a considerable short exocyclic Al&#8722;C bond, and computational studies involving molecular orbital and natural bond orbital analysis indicate the Al=C &#960; bonding character. The Al=C moiety of 5 undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation. Moreover, reaction of 5 with a diazo compound leads to the reduction and complete cleavage of the N=N double bond.

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction strategy is taken to synthesize diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu catalysts on 2D phosphorene. On the strength of the unique synergistic effect of PdCuP4 coordination, the adsorption of NO3&#8722;, the transfer of intermediates, and the formation of N&#8801;N bond are all enhanced, leading to the high NO3&#8722; removal rate and N2 selectivity.







Abstract
The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP4 coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3&#8201;% NO3&#8722; removal rate and 95.2&#8201;% N2 selectivity. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8722;O bond, and the short bond length of &#8776;3&#8197;&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO2&#8722;, and eventually the two Pd&#8722;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics is an essential model to rationalize enzyme reactions. The quantification of Michaelis&#8208;Menten parameters can be very challenging as it is sensitive to even small experimental errors. We here present a quantification of the uncertainty inherent to the experimental determination of kinetic rate parameters for enzymatic reactions. We study the influence of several sources of uncertainty and bias, including the inner filter effect, pipetting errors, number of points in the Michaelis&#8208;Menten curve, and flat&#8208;field correction. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analyses of experimental data, we compute typical uncertainties of&#160; [[EQUATION]] , [[EQUATION]] , and catalytic efficiency [[EQUATION]] . As a salient example, we analyze the extraction of such parameters for CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems. CRISPR diagnostics have recently attracted much interest and yet reports of these enzymatic kinetic rates have been highly unreliable and inconsistent.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Reductive Amination in Nonenzymatic Amino Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid biosynthesis initiates with the reductive amination of&#160;&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate with ammonia to produce glutamate. However, the other&#160;&#945;&#8208;keto acids coming from the glyoxylate or Krebs cycles are converted to amino acids by transamination, rather than by reductive amination. Why is only one amino acid synthesized by reductive amination and not the others? To answer this question, we quantified the inherent reactivities of keto acids in nonenzymatic reduction and reductive amination by using BH3CN&#8211;&#160;as a model nucleophile. Biological&#160;&#945;&#8208;keto acids were found to show pronounced nonenzymatic reactivity differences for the formation of amino acids (a&#8208;ketoglutarate &lt; oxaloacetate &#8776; pyruvate &lt;&lt; glyoxylate). Accordingly, the flow of ammonia passes through the least reactive&#160;&#945;&#8208;keto acid of the Krebs cycle. One possible explanation for this choice is the position of the corresponding amino acid, glutamate, at the top of the thermodynamic landscape for subsequent transamination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of the (bi)carbonate adlayer on Cu(100) electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  (Bi)carbonate adsorption on Cu(100) in 0.1 M KHCO  3  &#160;has been studied by  in situ  scanning tunneling microscopy. Coexistence of different ordered adlayer phases with ( [[EQUATION]] &#215; 6 [[EQUATION]] )R45&#176; and (4&#160;&#215; 4) unit cells was observed in the double layer potential regime. The adlayer is rather dynamic and undergoes a reversible order&#8208;disorder phase transition at 0&#160;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode.

Coexistence of different ordered adlayer phases with ( [[EQUATION]] &#215; 6 [[EQUATION]] )R45&#176; and (4&#160;&#215; 4) unit cells was observed in the double layer potential regime. The adlayer is rather dynamic and undergoes a reversible order-disorder phase transition at 0&#160;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional calculations indicate that the adlayer consists of coadsorbed carbonate and water molecules and is strongly stabilized by liquid water in the adjacent electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full Control of the Chiral Overpass Effect in Helical Polymers: P/M Screw Sense Induction by Remote Chiral Centers After Bypassing the First Chiral Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In helical polymers, helical sense induction is usually commanded by teleinduction mechanism, where the largest substituent of the chiral residue directly attached to the main chain is the one that commands the helical sense. In this work, different helical structures with different helical senses are induced in a helical polymer [poly(phenylacetylene)] when the conformational composition of two different dihedral angles of a pendant group with more than two chiral residues is tamed. Thus, while the dihedral angle at chiral residue  1  [( R  &#160;  )&#8208; or (S)&#8208;alanine], attached to the backbone, produces an extended or bent conformation in the pendant resulting in two scaffolds with different stretching degree, the second dihedral angle at chiral residue  2  [(  R  )&#8208; or (  S  )&#8208;methoxyphenylacetamide] places the substituents of this chiral center in a different spatial orientation, originating opposite helical senses at the polymer that are induced through a total control of the &#8220;chiral overpass effect&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Enhanced Oncolytic Virus&#8208;Like Nanoparticle for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T lymphocytes (T cells) are essential for tumor immunotherapy. However,  the  insufficient number of activated T cells  greatly limits the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy.  Herein, we proposed an  oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy to enhance T cell recruitment and activation for tumor treatment. We constructed an  oncolytic virus&#8208;like  nanoplatform (PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8)  that was degraded in the acidic tumor environment to  release PolyIC and  Zn2  +. The released PolyIC exhibited an  oncolytic virus&#8208;like function that induced tumor cell apoptosis and promoted T cell  recruitment  and activation through a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner. More importantly,  the released  Zn2+  not only enhanced T cell recruitment by inducing CXCL9/10/11 expression but also promoted T cell activation to increase interferon&#8208;&#947; (INF&#8208;&#947;) expression by i  nducing the phosphorylation of ZAP&#8208;70  via a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner.  This Zn2+&#8208;enhanced  oncolytic  virus&#8208;mimicking strategy provides a new approach for tumor  immunotherapy  .</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial Avenalumic Acid Biosynthesis Includes Substitution of an Aromatic Amino Group for Hydride by Nitrous Acid Dependent Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diazo group is an important functional group that can confer biological activity to natural products owing to its high reactivity. Recent studies have revealed that diazo groups are synthesized from amino groups using nitrous acid in secondary metabolites of actinomycetes. However, genome database analysis indicated that there are still many diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes for unknown biosynthetic pathways. Here, we discovered an avenalumic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77 by genome mining of enzymes involved in diazo group formation. Through heterologous expression, the gene cluster was revealed to direct avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthesis via 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;AAA). In vitro enzyme assays showed that AvaA6 and AvaA7 catalyzed the diazotization of 3&#8208;AAA using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively. This study revealed an unprecedented pathway for amino group removal via diazotization.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (SCoV2) and its variants of concern pose serious challenges to the public health. The  variants  increased challenges to vaccines, thus necessitating for development of new intervention strategies including anti&#8208;virals. Within the international Covid19&#8208;NMR consortium, we have identified binders targeting the RNA genome of SCoV2. We established protocols for the production and NMR characterization of more than 80% of all SCoV2 proteins. Here, we performed an NMR screening using a fragment library for binding to 25 SCoV2 proteins and identified hits also against previously unexplored SCoV2 proteins. Computational mapping was used to predict binding sites and identify functional moieties (chemotypes) of the ligands occupying these pockets. Striking consensus was observed between NMR&#8208;detected binding sites of the main protease and the computational procedure. Our investigation provides novel structural and chemical space for structure&#8208;based drug design against the SCoV2 proteome.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of &#8216;Elongated&#8217; Conformational States in &#945;&#8208;Synuclein upon Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), fibrillation, and forms insoluble intracellular Lewy&#8217;s bodies in neurons, which are the hallmark of Parkinson&#8217;s Disease (PD).   Neurotoxicity precedes the formation of aggregates and might be related to &#945;&#8208;syn LLPS.  The molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of LLPS are still elusive. To obtain structural insights into &#945;&#8208;syn upon LLPS, we take advantage of cross&#8208;linking/mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) and introduce an innovative approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive PAiring StatisticS). In this work, we show that the conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;syn shifts from a &#8216;hairpin&#8208;like&#8217; structure towards more &#8216;elongated&#8217; conformational states upon LLPS. We obtain insights into the critical initial stages of LLPS and establish a novel mass spectrometry&#8208;based approach that will aid to solve open questions in LLPS structural biology.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a CO&#8208;resilient MOR catalyst of palladium&#8208;tin nano&#8208;alloy anchored on Se&#8208;doped MXene (PdSn  0.5  /Se&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  ) via a progressive one&#8208;step electrochemical deposition strategy. MOR mass activity resulting from Pd/Se&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  catalyst (1046.2 mA mg  &#8208;1  ) is over 2&#8208;fold larger than that of Pd/Ti  3  C  2  , suggesting that the introduction of Se atoms on MXene might accelerate the reaction kinetics. PdSn  0.5  /Se&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  with Se&#8208;doping progress of MXene and the cooperated Pd&#8208;Sn sites has a superior MOR mass activity (4762.8 mA mg  &#8208;1  ), outperforming many other reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Both experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that boosted electron interaction of metal crystals with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8208;Sn sites can modulate the d band center, reduce adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, resulting in highly efficient removal of CO intermediates by reaction with neighboring OH species on adjacent Sn sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Siloxane&#8208;based Organosilicon Materials in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Siloxane&#8208;based molecular material, by virtue of its unique chemical structure, thermal and electrochemical properties, has triggered tremendous research interest and sparked a revolution for energy storage in the past years. Siloxanes and their analogues are generally demonstrated more environmentally friendly, durable and safer when employed to&#160;reconstruct the nano&#8208;micro&#160;surface&#160;structure of electrode, separator and their interfaces with electrolyte. To master the recent and comprehensive achievement of siloxane&#8208;based materials in energy storage, a systematic summary is necessary to offer important clues, aiming at achieving better electrochemical properties. Herein, a minireview on siloxane materials in terms of molecule design, functionality and unique superiority for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors is presented comprehensively and systematically. The challenges, perspectives and future directions of siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials are put forward for higher performances and wider applications in electrochemical energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts for Direct Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent progress in the chemistry of Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), direct FLP&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of CO  2  remains elusive. From a near&#8208;infinite array of plausible Lewis pairs, it is challenging to identify individual combinations that are appropriate for catalyzing this reaction. To this end, we developed a general computational approach, based on linear scaling relationships, to map the chemical composition of FLPs to their activity towards direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO  2  into formate. The resulting maps pinpoint specific FLP combinations with the proper complementary acidity and basicity to optimally balance the energetics of the catalytic cycle. One such combination was experimentally validated to achieve  hitherto  unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Inhibitor Synthesis and Screening by Fluorescence Polarization: An Efficient Approach for Accelerating Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry has emerged as a useful tool for hit identification, but has not been widely used, in part due to challenges associated with analyses involving complex mixtures. We describe an operationally simple alternative: in situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS), which links high&#8208;throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening tor target binding by fluorescence. We exemplify the ISISS method by showing how coupling screening for target binding by fluorescence polarization with the reaction of acyl&#8208;hydrazides and aldehydes led to the efficient discovery of a potent and novel acylhydrazone&#8208;based inhibitor of human prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a target for anemia treatment, with equivalent in vivo potency to an approved medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8211;H Arylation of Anilines with Aromatic Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8211;H functionalizations is a key challenge in chemical method development. In arenes, functionalizations are most difficult to direct towards the C&#8211;H group furthest away from a substituent, in its  para  position. We herein demonstrate how the  para  &#8208;C&#8211;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides, elusive to date, is achieved by a base&#8208;assisted &#8220;metalla&#8208;tautomerism&#8221; approach. A proton is abstracted from the aniline substrate and replaced by an arylpalladium species, generated from the aryl halide coupling partner. In this step, the palladium is directed away from the  N  &#8208; to the tautomeric  para  &#8208;C&#8211;H position by a large phosphine ligand combined with a triphenylmethyl shielding group. The triphenylmethyl group is easily installed and removed, and can be recycled.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorinated fused rings are challenging to construct from simple starting materials. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade reactions of readily available cyclopropanols and  &#593;  &#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted olefins for the synthesis of fused  gem  &#8208;difluorooxetanes. Two rings and three bonds were efficiently constructed in one reaction. The reaction showed broad substrate scope and the downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction. The mechanistic study supported the presence of cascade photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation of Hexafluoroacetone Hydrate Enables Hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented photoredox&#8208;catalyzed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation of hexafluoroacetone hydrate was established to accomplish the hydroxylpolyfluoroalkylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. A range of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols were facilely accessed by using readily available hexafluoroacetone hydrate, instead of toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. A range of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are tolerated, giving the corresponding hydro&#8208;hydroxylpolyfluoroalkylated products in moderate to high yields. Remarkable features of this synthetic strategy include operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, excellent regioselectivity, and broad functional group tolerance. The success of this strategy relies on the delicate utilization of aldehyde/ketone&#8212; gem  &#8208;diol intrinsic equilibrium, which offers an innovated open&#8208;shell pathway for the assembly of synthetically challenging polyfluoroalkylated scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography: A New Paradigm for Versatility in Simultaneous Multicomponent Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generality in analytical chemistry can be manifested in impactful platforms that can streamline modern organic synthesis and biopharmaceutical processes. We herein introduce a hybrid separation technique named Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), which is built upon an automated dynamic modulation of CO2, organic modifier, and water blends. This concept enables simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range in single experimental runs. After a careful investigation of its fundamental aspects, a DGUC&#8208;DAD&#8208;MS screening workflow that combines multiple orthogonal column and mobile phase choices across a far&#8208;reaching universal elution profile is also reported. The power of this framework is demonstrated with new analytical applications guiding academic and industrial laboratories in the development of new (bio)pharmaceutical targets (e.g. synthetic intermediates, nucleosides, cyclic and linear peptides, proteins, antibody drug conjugates).</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylative Selective Phosphorylation of Aliphatic Acids: A Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208; and Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Avenue to Dialkyl and Trialkyl Phosphine Oxides from White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing practical and mild strategies for the direct functionalization of white phosphorus (P  4  ) without chlorination is an appealing but formidable challenge. Toward this end, we report a breakthrough in the preparation of structurally diverse dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines that rely on the successive generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from  N  &#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters and the controllable alkylation of the P  4  molecule under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. To facilitate separation and prevent product losses during purification, the corresponding oxidation products dialkylphosphine oxides (DAPOs) and trialkylphosphine oxides (TAPOs) were isolated. This photoinduced phosphorylation reaction features one&#8208;pot operation, high product selectivity, and tolerates a broad range of alkyl NHPI esters, including derivatives of complex natural products and pharmaceuticals. Further diversified transformation of DAPOs to construct P&#8211;F, P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N and, P&#8211;O bonds was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy was proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY). In this way, Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY are periodically interrupted to reformat and strengthen the delocalized electronic states, ultimately yielding excellent electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing decoration.







Abstract
&#960; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8722;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Halogen Atom Participation in Guiding the Stereochemical Outcomes of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic additions to &#945;&#8208;haloacetals proceed via an oxocarbenium ion intermediate where the carbon&#8208;halogen bond can either adopt a pseudo&#8208;axial or a pseudo&#8208;equatorial position. trans&#8208;Selectivity is typically observed when a halogen atom is positioned at C&#8208;2 of an acetal because hyperconjugative interactions involving the pseudo&#8208;axial carbon&#8208;halogen bond stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.







Abstract
Acetal substitution reactions of &#945;&#8208;halogenated five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings can be highly stereoselective. Erosion of stereoselectivity occurs as nucleophilicity increases, which is consistent with additions to a halogen&#8208;stabilized oxocarbenium ion, not a three&#8208;membered&#8208;ring halonium ion. Computational investigations confirmed that the open&#8208;form oxocarbenium ions are the reactive intermediates involved. Kinetic studies suggest that hyperconjugative effects and through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions can both contribute to the stabilization of halogen&#8208;substituted oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. The most stable isomer of Be4B12+ cluster is a closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms.







Abstract
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. When beryllium is gradually added to the B12 motif, it undergoes drastic structural modifications. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is an Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium forms strong bonding with the boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interactions. For instance, the bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ fragment in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12, followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.

         <title>Sequential Passivation for Lead&#8208;Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) was proposed. The ACAC treatment can enlarge the grain size, and the EDA treatment stabilizes the perovskite against oxidation. A 13.0&#8201;% efficiency with improved stability was reported, which is one of the top efficiencies and stabilities for tin halide perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead&#8208;based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by the fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) enhancement). A promising 13&#8201;% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or amines are selected, with similar effects.

     alt="Sequential Passivation for Lead-Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technique of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) was proposed. The ACAC treatment can enlarge the grain size, and the EDA treatment stabilizes the perovskite against oxidation. A 13.0&#8201;% efficiency with improved stability was reported, which is one of the top efficiencies and stabilities for tin halide perovskite-based solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead-free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead-based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by the fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short-circuit current (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) enhancement). A promising 13&#8201;% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or amines are selected, with similar effects. This study provides a universal strategy to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects while fabricating stable PKSCs with high efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Aryl&#8208;Alkene Axis by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction to forge the atropisomeric biaryls has seen remarkable progress but exploration of this chemistry to directly forge chiral C(aryl)&#8208;C(alkene) axis is underdeveloped. The replacement of arene substrates by alkenes intensifies the challenges in terms of reactivity, configurational atropostability of product and selectivity control. By meticulous ligand design and fine&#8208;tuning of reaction parameters, we identified a highly active 3,3'&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand to realize arene&#8208;alkene Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under very mild conditions. The axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes were generated in commendable efficiency, enantioselectivity and  E  /  Z  selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges Arising from Continuous Flow Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The versatility of olefin metathesis is evident from its successful applications ranging from natural product synthesis to the valorization of renewable feedstocks. On the other side, flow chemistry has recently gained particular interest among the synthetic community, offering valuable alternatives to classic batch chemistry and paving the way to the development of new transformations. The application of continuous flow to olefin metathesis represents one of the most promising evolutions in the field at the interface of industrially relevant synthesis and reactor engineering, significantly improving some of the typical problems such as undesired self&#8208;reactions and ethylene&#8208;mediated catalyst de&#8208;activation. This review aims to provide a small survey covering the major aspects of those techniques which we hope may be of interest for the chemical community, but also those interested in catalysis, continuous processing, enabling technologies and reactor design.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;compartmentalization of Enzymes and Cofactors within Pickering Emulsion Droplets for Continuous Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;immobilization of enzymes and cofactors in a manner suitable for use in continuous flow catalysis remains a great challenge because of the difficulty in ensuring the free accessibility of immobilized enzymes and cofactors. Herein, we present a continuous flow catalysis system based on co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets, which can realize co&#8208;immobilized enzymes and cofactors and regeneration of cofactors within the droplets. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, our systems exhibit long&#8208;term stability (300&#8208;400 h), outstanding total turnover number (TTN, 59204 mol mol &#8208;1  ) and several&#8208;fold enhancement in the enzyme catalytic efficiency (CE e  ) in comparison to conventional biphasic reactions. Our method along with revealing insight into the co&#8208;compartmentalization effects will provide a vast opportunity for significantly advancing continuous flow biocatalysis towards the level of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and physico&#8208;chemical properties of cryptophazane, a soluble and functionalizable C1&#8208;symmetrical cryptophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of cryptophazane, a cryptophane functionalized with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the methylene bridges, is obtained with a 28% overall yield over 8 steps, through the preparation of a  C  1  &#8208;symmetrical aza&#8208;cyclotriveratrylene (aza&#8208;CTV). In this paper, we demonstrate that the introduction of nitrogen atom on this part of the cryptophane core enhances the solubility in organic media of both the cryptophane and the synthetic intermediates while presenting the same conformation as known cryptophanes. Cryptophazane was prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale and easily functionalized. We also investigated its ability to encapsulate xenon atoms using hyperpolarized  129  Xe (HP  129  Xe) NMR spectroscopy. We found that both its affinity and exchange kinetics were in the appropriate range for applications in  129  Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combined with the wide range of possible functionalization, this makes cryptophazane an excellent candidate for targeted HP  129  Xe MRI.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of heterogeneous photocatalysis has facilitated redox reactions with high efficiency, without compromising the recyclability of the photocatalyst. Recently, stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic materials have emerged as a powerful synthetic tool, with simple and rapid recovery, as well as an enhanced dynamic control over reactions. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are often inexpensive and easy to produce. They can be switched from an active &#8220;on&#8221; state to an inert &#8220;off&#8221; state in response to external stimuli, allowing the production of photocatalyst with adaptability, recyclability, and orthogonal control on different chemical reactions. Despite this versatility, the application of artificial smart material in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has not yet been maximized. In this review, we will examine the recent developments of this emerging class of stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. We will discuss the synthesis route of appending photoactive components into different triggerable systems and, in particular, the controlled activation and recovery of the materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Modulated Nucleofugality of SeIII Species to Enable Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Semipinacol Manifolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical bond activations mediated by H&#8208;bond interactions involving highly electronegative elements such as nitrogen and oxygen are powerful tactics in modern catalysis research. On the contrary, kindred catalytic regimes in which heavier, less electronegative elements such as selenium engage in H&#8208;bond interactions to co&#8208;activate C&#8211;Se s&#8208;bonds under oxidative conditions are elusive. Traditional strategies to enhance the nucleofugality of selenium residues predicate on the oxidative addition of electrophiles onto Se  II  &#8208;centers, which entails the elimination of the resulting Se  IV  moieties. Catalytic procedures in which Se  IV  nucleofuges are substituted rather than eliminated are very rare and, so far, not applicable to carbon&#8211;carbon bond formations. In this study, we introduce an unprecedented combination of O&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Se H&#8208;bond interactions and single electron oxidation to catalytically generate Se  III  nucleofuges that allow for the formation of new C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bonds by means of a type I semipinacol process in high yields and excellent selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering the Ultrafast Opening and Closure Dynamics of a Photochromic Coordination Cage by Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical studies on supramolecular hosts that can encapsulate small guest molecules commonly focus on three aspects: photoswitching the cage to release or trap the guest, the effect of the confining environment on the guest, and light&#8208;induced exciton or charge transfer within the cage structure. Here, we exploit ultrafast spectroscopy to address how the guest alters the photoswitching characteristics of the cage. For this, the impacts of three disparate guest compounds on ring&#8208;opening or ring&#8208;closure of a dithienylethene (DTE) ligand in a photoswitchable DTE&#8208;based coordination cage are juxtaposed. The guest modulates both outcome and timescale of the cage&#8217;s photodynamics, by an interplay of structural strain, heavy&#8208;atom effect, and enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer processes exercised by the guest on the photo&#8208;excited cage. The approach might prove beneficial for attuning the applicability of photoswitchable nanocontainers and desired&#8232; guest compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Phase Separation Behavior and Pathway&#8208;Directed Information Exchange in all&#8208;DNA Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation provides a versatile approach to fabricating cell&#8208;mimicking coacervates. Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a straightforward formation of all&#8208;DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth process. Ca2+ allows for irreversible, whereas Mg2+ leads to reversible phase separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the information transfer of one&#8208;component DNA droplets and two&#8208;component core&#8208;shell protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA that lead to new phenomena in cell&#8208;mimicking systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic AIE crosslinks in liquid crystal networks: visualizing for actuation&#8208;guiding, re&#8208;bonding for actuation&#8208;altering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable liquid crystal networks (CALCNs) are highly potential actuating materials due to their actuation properties and shape reprogrammability. Given the importance of network crosslinking state in a CALCN actuator, we sought an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to probe and visualize its dynamic network while ensuring actuation and reprogramming. Here, tetraphenylethylene derivatives were incorporated into liquid crystal networks via the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction, acting simultaneously as reversible crosslinkers and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probes. The thermally tunable fluorescence of the resulting network can correlate to and thus visualize the actuator&#8217;s crosslinking status, actuation capability and temperature in real&#8208;time and in situ, yielding an intriguing actuation limit&#8208;alerting function. Furthermore, we verified unprecedented reprogrammability of the AIE&#8208;type CALCNs through both associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms of DA chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Route to Novel Diazaphosphinine&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping main&#8208;group elements has become a unique strategy to fine&#8208;tune optoelectronic properties of organic &#120587; &#8208;conjugated molecules. Herein, we report the first example of diazaphosphinine based polycyclic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) via facile synthetic protocols. Synthesis of diazaphosphinine heterocycles harnesses mild and efficient P &#8722; N chemistry. The heterocycles readily undergo photocyclizations by using only oxidants. The photocyclization protocol is applicable to the heterocycles with various P&#8208;centers. We successfully extended the protocols in extended DP&#8208;PAHs with 13&#8208;fused aromatic rings. Further adjusting P&#8208;chemistry allows to efficiently fine&#8208;tune the singlet and triplet emission characteristics. More importantly, single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting character was achieved via the balanced singlet and triplet emission of DP&#8208;PAH. Therefore, this work opens up new horizons in the area of organic &#120587; &#8208;conjugated materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Library of Rare Earth Oxide Ultrathin Nanowires with Polymer&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin nanowires (NWs) have always attracted the attention of researchers due to their unique properties, but their facile synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein we developed a general method for the synthesis of rare earth (RE) oxide ultrathin NWs at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50 oC). The formation mechanism of ultrathin NWs lies in two aspects: thermodynamic advantage of one dimensional (1D) growth at low temperature, and supplement of effective monomers. As an extension, fifteen kinds of RE oxide ultrathin NWs were synthesized through this strategy, and they all exhibited polymer&#8208;like behaviors. Meanwhile, the high viscosity, organic gel, wet&#8208; and electro&#8208;spinning of Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O NWs were studied in detail, demonstrating the similarity of ultrathin inorganic NWs to polymers. In addition, the Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O ultrathin NWs were used as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation and showed excellent performance with toluene conversion ratio of 83.8%, suggesting their potential application in organic photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organogold(III) Complexes Display Conditional Photoactivities: Evolving From Photodynamic into Photoactivated Chemotherapy in Response to O2 Consumption for Robust Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a spatiotemporally controllable, powerful approach in combating cancers but suffers from low activity under hypoxia, whereas photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) operates in an O  2  &#8208;independent manner but compromises the ability to harness O  2  for potent photosensitization. Herein we report that cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes display a PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photoactivity for efficient cancer treatment. On the one hand, the gold(III) complexes can act as dual photosensitizers and substrates, leading to conditional PDT activity in oxygenated condition that progresses to highly efficient PACT (j up to 0.63) when O  2  is depleted in solution and under cellular environment. On the other hand, the conditional PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT reactivity can be triggered by external photosensitizers in a similar manner in vitro and in vivo, giving additional tumor&#8208;selectivity and/or deep tissue penetration by red&#8208;light irradiation that leads to robust anticancer efficacy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Integrating artificial enzymes onto nanostructures target&#8208; and site&#8208;specifically is still a challenge. Here we show that target miRNAs trigger the formation of DNAzyme site&#8208;specifically at the tip of filamentous phage for detecting miRNA biomarkers. Through an antibody&#8208;modified oligonucleotide, the tip of the phage with magnetic nanoparticles on the sidewall captures a target miRNA, inducing the formation of DNAzyme that extends from the phage tip through a hybridization chain reaction. After magnetic separation, the resultant complex catalyzes a colorimetric reaction with the signal correlated to target concentrations, leading to the quantification of miRNAs with a detection limit of 5.0 fM, about 10  3  folds lower than the phage&#8208;free approach. Our approach can differentiate miRNA mutants and quantify miRNA in human plasma, tumor cells, and tissues with high sensitivity, suggesting that the target&#8208;triggered integration of enzymes and phages holds promise for searching for new catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pas de Deux of an NO Couple: Synchronous Photoswitching from a Double&#8208;Linear to a Double&#8208;Bent Ru(NO)2 Core under Nitrosyl Charge Conservation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The picture shows the transition state (TS) which connects the double&#8208;linear ground state (GS) with the double&#8208;bent metastable state (MS) of the dinitrosylruthenium compound [Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2] (1). The TS's strongly negative vibrational mode (&#8722;831&#8197;cm&#8722;1) traces the decay path if the photo&#8208;generated MS is warmed above 230&#8197;K. 1 provides the first example of synchronous photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) involving two ligands (see Supporting Information for an animation of the movement).







Abstract
The {Ru(NO)2}10 dinitrosylruthenium complex [Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2] (1) shows photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) of a special kind: the two NO ligands switch, on photo&#8208;excitation, synchronously from the ground state (GS) with two almost linear RuNO functions to a metastable state (MS) which persists up to 230&#8197;K and can be populated to &#8776;50&#8201;%. The MS was experimentally characterised by photo&#8208;crystallography, IR spectroscopy and DS&#8208;calorimetry as a double&#8208;bent variant of the double&#8208;linear GS. The experimental results are confirmed by computation which unravels the GS/MS transition as a disrotatory synchronous 50&#176; turn of the two nitrosyl ligands. Although 1 shows the usual redshift of the N&#8722;O stretch on bending the MNO unit, there is no increased charge transfer from Ru to NO along the GS&#8208;to&#8208;MS path. In terms of the effective&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state (EOS) method, both isomers of 1 and the transition state are Ru&#8722;II(NO+)2 species.

         <title>A Greener Route to Blue: Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a phthalocyanine, through simple solid&#8208;state static aging, is reported in the Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209033) by Sandra Kaabel, Eduardo Anaya&#8208;Plaza et al. This greener approach diminishes up to 100&#8208;fold the solvent usage of the traditional solution synthesis. Several metal derivatives (Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+), as well as electron&#8208;deficient derivatives were synthesized. The image shows the crude zinc tetra(tBu)phthalocyanine as obtained.

The otherwise insoluble binary Zintl anions (TrBi3)2&#8722; (Tr=Ga, In, Tl) can be solubilized in THF on treatment with the low&#8208;coordinate manganese complex [Mn(hmds)2] (hmds=N(SiMe3)2), yielding new heterometallic Zintl clusters [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722;, [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (see figure), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722;. The electronic properties of the Bi22&#8722; anion&#8208;containing coordination compounds are disclosed.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrochromic Soft Photonic Crystals Based on MXene&#8208;Integrated Blue Phase Liquid Crystals for Bioinspired Visible and Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired visible and infrared camouflage materials are judiciously designed and fabricated by the controlled in situ growth of novel electrochromic soft photonic crystals onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films exhibiting low mid&#8208;infrared emissivity. This work is expected to shine new light into the development of intelligent nanostructured materials for advanced adaptive camouflage and thermal radiation management&#8208;related technologies.







Abstract
Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by the controlled in situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene&#8208;integrated 3D soft photonic crystals exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel&#8208;controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free&#8208;standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid&#8208;IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Bioinspired visible and infrared camouflage materials are judiciously designed and fabricated by the controlled in situ growth of novel electrochromic soft photonic crystals onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films exhibiting low mid-infrared emissivity. This work is expected to shine new light into the development of intelligent nanostructured materials for advanced adaptive camouflage and thermal radiation management-related technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by the controlled in situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene-integrated 3D soft photonic crystals exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof-of-concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel-controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free-standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid-IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Anhydrides for the Solvent&#8208;Controlled Switchable Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro Compounds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers selective fragmentation of a C&#8722;Cl bond of chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) generating a gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical intermediate. In the presence of olefin and under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, a notable synthetic divergence is achieved to access a wide array of gem&#8208;difluoro compounds.







Abstract
The incorporation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene (CF2) group into organic frameworks is highly sought due to the influence of this unit on the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of molecules. Herein we report an operationally simple, mild, and switchable protocol to access various gem&#8208;difluoro compounds that employs chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) as a low&#8208;cost and versatile fluoroalkylating reagent. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers mesolytic cleavage of a C&#8722;Cl bond generating a gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical. In the presence of alkene, this radical species acts as a unique intermediate that, under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, delivers a wide range of gem&#8208;difluorinated &#947;&#8208;lactams, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and promotes oxy&#8208;perfluoroalkylation. These protocols are flow&#8208; and batch&#8208;scalable, possess excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecules.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Accelerated Precursor Crystallisation in Ambient Air for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells toward Mass Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase crystallized mixed&#8208;cation perovskite powder assisted with moisture in ambient air is developed. The significant role of moisture in introducing the solvation effect and the facet orientation change of PbI2 is demonstrated by a combined experimental and theoretical investigation. Perovskite solar cells based on &#945;&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;cation perovskite powder deliver an impressive PCE of 24.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;pure crystallised perovskite is considered an excellent precursor for fabricating high&#8208;stability perovskite films with minimal defects. However, currently available protocols for synthesising crystallised perovskites must be conducted in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of an organic solvent as the reaction medium, which hinders mass production. Here, we report the fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase&#8208;crystallised perovskite powder assisted by moisture in ambient air. Moisture can promote the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts and facilitate complete phase transition, as demonstrated in a joint experimental and theoretical study. Perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 24.07&#8201;% were achieved using phase&#8208;pure crystallised perovskite powder as the precursor. This ambient&#8208;air&#8208;compatible method opens new vistas to reproducible high&#8208;quality precursors for large&#8208;scale photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Discovery of Thioxanthone&#8208;TfOH Complex as Photoredox Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Alkenes using p&#8208;Xylene as both Electron and Hydrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of alkenes is one of the most fundamental transformations in organic synthesis, which was widely used in petrochemical industry, pharmaceutical industry and food industry. Although numerous hydrogenation methods are developed, novel types of catalysis with new mechanism, and new hydrogen source are still desirable yet exceedingly challenging. Thioxanthone (TX) is widely used in energy transfer photoreactions, but rarely in photoredox process. Here we show catalytic amount of TfOH as cocatalyst can tune TX into a photoredox catalyst with highly enhanced oxidative capability in the hydrogenation of carbonylated alkenes with the cheap petroleum industrial product  p  &#8208;xylene serving as hydrogen source. Deuterium can also be introduced by this method using D  2  O as D source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using  p  &#8208;xylene as hydrogen source.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Effects on the Threading Kinetics of Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped Guests into the Cavity of Oxatub[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented threading kinetics was revealed between viologen&#8208;based guests and conformationally adaptive oxatub[4]arene. Three representative conformations of oxatub[4]arene are involved in the kinetic and thermodynamic products which follow the opposite orders in their rankings. Consequently, error correction was involved and a complex kinetic process was observed in a simple two&#8208;component system. Moreover, it was found that some viologen&#8208;based guests have much faster threading kinetics than those of DABCO&#8208;based with the same stoppers. This was enabled by an unprecedented threading mechanism in which a tilted conformation of the guests is adopted by involving one linear alkyl group on the 3,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzyl stoppers, the viologen core, and the methylene spacers in the transition states. This new mechanism even allows the viologen&#8208;based guests with the 3,5&#8208;dicetyloxybenzyl stoppers to form a pseudorotaxane with oxatub[4]arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Conformational Change of Disulfide&#8208;Rich Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide bond formation is a common mechanism for regulating conformational changes in proteins during oxidative folding. Despite extensive studies of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to constrain peptide conformation, few studies have explored their usage in developing self&#8208;assembling peptides. Herein, we report that a thiol&#8208;rich peptide could fold into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation through the formation of two hetero&#8208;disulfide bonds upon oxidation, subsequently self&#8208;assembling into a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Breaking disulfide bonds under reductive condition, the hydrogel exhibited a transition from hydrogel to solution. Molecular simulation revealed that intermolecular interaction between two tryptophan residues was indispensable for hydrogelation. This work is the first case of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to control conformational change and self&#8208;assembly, and provides a cell&#8208;compatible hydrogel material for potential biomedical application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The   scalable and durable   e   lectrosynthesis   of   high&#8208;valued organonitrogen compounds from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules   ,   especially operating  at a high current density  , is highly desirable.   Here,   a one&#8208;pot electrooxidation method to synthesize formamide (HCONH  2  ) from methanol and ammonia over a commercial   b   oron&#8208;   d   oped   d   iamond (BDD) catalyst is reported. The formamide selectivity from methanol and formamide Faradaic efficiency (FE  HCONH2  ) achieve  73.2% and 41.2% at the current density  of 120 mA cm  &#8208;2  with high durability. The C  &#8208;  N bond originates from the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on an aldehyde&#8208;like intermediate. Impressively, an 8 L electrolyzer is employed for the pilot plant test over a 2200 cm  2  BDD electrode, which exhibits  33.5% FE  HCONH2  at  120 mA cm  &#8208;2  (current: 264 A  ) with a yield rate of  36.9 g h  &#8208;1  ,  demonstrating the potential of this technique for large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Chiral Carbene&#8208;Cu(I)&#8208;Amide Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical&#8208;active materials have been bursting into bloom in recent years, while chiroptical&#8208;active CMA complexes has not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral Cu(I)&#8208;based CMA enantiomers,  (R,R)&#8208;  PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC  and  (S,S)  &#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC  , were developed by using chiral phenyl&#8208;substituted  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The Cu(I)&#8208;based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, first reported in CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand&#8208;ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these Cu(I) enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from perspective of aggregation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Solid Superprotonic Supramolecular Polymer Electrolytes Based on Deep Eutectic Solvents and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) exhibit intriguing benefits in functional soft materials due to their dynamic bonding feature. However, most SPs can only exist in the solution state and fail to form bulk materials, which limits their applications. Here, we report the fabrication of semi&#8208;solid bulk SP materials by using polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify a deep eutectic solvent (DES). The abundant protons and strong hydrogen bonds afforded by POMs enable these SP materials as superprotonic conductive electrolytes with sufficient mechanical strength, showing a proton conductivity more than 1&#215;10  &#8208;4  &#160;S cm  &#8208;1&#160;  and a breaking strength exceeding 1 MPa at room temperature. Moreover, the thermodynamic reversibility of the SP electrolytes allows them to form a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by a facile melt&#8208;infiltration strategy upon mild heating, which leads to improved performance in supercapacitors. This work presents an innovative DES/POM hybrid system as a promising platform to develop functional supramolecular materials for energy and electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Well&#8208;defined Bimetallic 2D Polymers with Single Layer Thickness for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Innovative bimetallic materials provide more possibilities for further improving the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influencing factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hinders in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19 s  &#8722;1  was achieved at the overpotential of 500 mV.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Covalent Triazine Frameworks: at the Crossroad between Homogenous and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous single&#8208;site and single&#8208;atom catalysts potentially enable combining the high catalytic activity and selectivity of molecular catalysts with the easy continuous operation and recycling of solid catalysts. In recent years, covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) found increasing attention as support materials for particulate and isolated metal species. Bearing a high fraction of nitrogen&#8208;sites, they allow coordinating molecular metal species and stabilizing particulate metal species, respectively. Dependent on synthesis method and pretreatment of CTFs, materials resembling well&#8208;defined highly crosslinked polymers or materials comparable to structurally ill&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;containing carbons result. Accordingly, CTFs serve as model systems elucidating the interaction of single&#8208;site, single&#8208;atom and particulate metal species with such supports. Factors influencing the transition between molecular and particulate systems are discussed to allow deriving tailored catalyst systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Best&#8208;Practice DFT Protocols for Basic Molecular Computational Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. Most of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations apply various combinations of DFT&#8208;based methods. This Scientific Perspective provides best&#8208;practice protocols and guidance in the choice of robust method combinations to deal with many day&#8208;to&#8208;day challenges in computational chemistry and discusses representative examples.







Abstract
Nowadays, many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. The lion's share of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations applies density functional theory (DFT) evaluated in atomic&#8208;orbital basis sets. This work provides best&#8208;practice guidance on the numerous methodological and technical aspects of DFT calculations in three parts: Firstly, we set the stage and introduce a step&#8208;by&#8208;step decision tree to choose a computational protocol that models the experiment as closely as possible. Secondly, we present a recommendation matrix to guide the choice of functional and basis set depending on the task at hand. A particular focus is on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency through multi&#8208;level approaches. Finally, we discuss selected representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and the effect of methodological choices.

This work provides best-practice guidance on the numerous methodological and technical aspects of DFT calculations in three parts: Firstly, we set the stage and introduce a step-by-step decision tree to choose a computational protocol that models the experiment as closely as possible. Secondly, we present a recommendation matrix to guide the choice of functional and basis set depending on the task at hand. A particular focus is on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency through multi-level approaches. Finally, we discuss selected representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and the effect of methodological choices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Phase Transitions on Diffusive Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive transport of a hydrophobic cation, measured with nonlinear light scattering, across the membrane of liposomes composed of E. coli lipid extracts increases dramatically at membrane phase transition temperatures.







Abstract
Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug&#8208;releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time&#8208;resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#8201;&#176;C to 36&#8201;&#176;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid&#8208;disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#8201;&#176;C and 27.6&#8201;&#176;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the liquid&#8208;disordered phase at 36&#8201;&#176;C is 35&#8208;times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;s&#8722;1 of the gel phase at 9&#8201;&#176;C. For the mixed&#8208;phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid&#8208;disordered bulk.

         <title>Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to Methanol: The Renaissance of Low&#8208;Temperature Catalysis in the Context of the Methanol Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of renewable methanol using recycled CO2 and green H2 is a long&#8208;term solution to address the carbon conundrum and achieve a sustainable economy. This Review reflects on the key developments in low&#8208;temperature methanol synthesis from CO2 and CO using homogeneous catalysts. The integration of direct air capture of CO2 and its conversion to methanol as a promising avenue in &#8220;air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel&#8221; technologies is also highlighted.







Abstract
The traditional economy based on carbon&#8208;intensive fuels and materials has led to an exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 levels increased by 50&#8201;% since the pre&#8208;industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed methanol economy pioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO2 to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction, homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO2, CO and their derivatives as potential low&#8208;temperature alternatives to the commercial processes. This Review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.

         <title>[8]Cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine as A Super&#8208;Cyclooctatetraene: Dynamic Behavior, Global Aromaticity, and Open&#8208;Shell Diradical Character in The Neutral and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;cyclooctatetraene, one new core&#8208;expanded analogue of cyclooctatetraene, has been synthesized by insertion of a benzenoid/quinoid C6H4 unit into each C&#8722;C bond. The neutral molecule shows three dynamic processes on the NMR time scale and non&#8208;aromatic character, whereas its dication exhibits enhanced planarity, global aromatic, and open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
An [8]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes) was synthesized. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a tub&#8208;shaped geometry similar to the cyclooctatetraene, with alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclosed a slow valence tautomerization process with an interconversion energy barrier of about 11.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at coalescence temperature (273&#8197;K), and two more lower&#8208;barrier dynamic processes involving flipping of the 1,4&#8208;phenyl rings on the backbone and rotation of the mesityl substituents. Its dication ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes2+) adopts a bowl&#8208;like geometry with a smaller depth of the cavity, and a slow bowl inversion process was observed by dynamic NMR. The bond lengths of the benzenoid/quinoid rings are more averaged via electron delocalization and the molecule shows global aromaticity, which was further validated by NMR and theoretical analysis. [8]CPPM&#8208;Mes2+ exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8722;1.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Woven nodes, serving as dynamic crosslinks, afford a woven polymer network (WPN). The WPN exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of covalent polymer network (CPN), but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity, self&#8208;healing, and reprocessability, resembling to those of supramolecular polymer network (SPN).







Abstract
Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multifunctional enzyme is reported that can promote biocatalytic cascades based on multiple stereoselective steps. Specifically, a 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme can form enamine and iminium ion intermediates from aldehydes and enals to promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamines and iminium ions and combine their mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.

&lt;p&gt;A single multifunctional enzyme is reported that can promote biocatalytic cascades based on multiple stereoselective steps. Specifically, a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) enzyme can form enamine and iminium ion intermediates from aldehydes and enals to promote both a two-component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamines and iminium ions and combine their mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes.

         <title>High&#8208;Humidity Shaker Aging to Access Chitin and Cellulose Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance. It relies on a new mechanochemical method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA), involving mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate.







Abstract
To unlock nature's potential for functional biomaterials, many efforts have been devoted to isolating the nanocrystalline domains within the supramolecular structure of polysaccharides. Yet, low reactivity and yield in aqueous systems along with excessive solvent usage hinders its development. In this report, the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance is described, relying on a new method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA). The method involves a mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate. Insights into the mechanism were uncovered, which highlighted the unique role of high humidity to afford a gradual uptake of water by the material up to deliquescence when the reaction is complete. This process was then validated for direct synthesis of nanocrystals from biomass sources including crab and soft wood pulp.

         <dc:description>
The inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers was investigated. Bridged bicyclic lactones were obtained diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively and converted into synthetically relevant polysubstituted enantioenriched cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene derivatives. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards a stepwise mechanism.







Abstract
A broadly applicable diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers is reported herein. Using a copper(II)&#8208;BOX catalytic system, bridged bicyclic lactones are obtained in very high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers. Mechanistic experiments as well as DFT calculations indicate the occurrence of a stepwise mechanism. The synthetic potential of the bridged bicyclic lactones is showcased by the enantioselective synthesis of polyfunctional cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes, as well as a carbasugar unit.

         <title>Luminescence Lifetime Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight related luminescence mechanisms, selected techniques of luminescence lifetime imaging based on lanthanide nanoparticles, and their advanced applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data storage, bio&#8208;multiplexing, and biosensing.







Abstract
Luminescence lifetime imaging has exhibited significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification detection because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetimes. Recently, great emphasis has been put on the exploration of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long&#8208;lived luminescence. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter out background signals during imaging, but also provides a wide range of tunable lifetime. Here, we introduce the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs, the key strategies for luminescence lifetime modulation, data acquisition methods, and several cutting&#8208;edge applications in lifetime imaging systems. Then we describe several prospects to inspire efforts for improving technologies and extending applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.

         <title>Formation of Organic Acids and Carbonyl Compounds in n&#8208;Butane Oxidation via &#947;&#8208;Ketohydroperoxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry in conjunction with single photon tunable synchrotron radiation provides clear experimental evidence of organic acids and carbonyl formation from &#947;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide decomposition via the Korcek mechanism. These results provide experimental and computational bounds that enable the construction of more realistic and accurate chemical kinetic mechanisms for autoignition chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial chain&#8208;branching step in autoignition is the decomposition of ketohydroperoxides (KHP) to form an oxy radical and OH. Other pathways compete with chain&#8208;branching, such as &#8220;Korcek&#8221; dissociation of &#947;&#8208;KHP to a carbonyl and an acid. Here we characterize the formation of a &#947;&#8208;KHP and its decomposition to formic acid+acetone products from observations of n&#8208;butane oxidation in two complementary experiments. In jet&#8208;stirred reactor measurements, KHP is observed above 590&#8197;K. The KHP concentration decreases with increasing temperature, whereas formic acid and acetone products increase. Observation of characteristic isotopologs acetone&#8208;d3 and formic acid&#8208;d0 in the oxidation of CH3CD2CD2CH3 is consistent with a Korcek mechanism. In laser&#8208;initiated oxidation experiments of n&#8208;butane, formic acid and acetone are produced on the timescale of KHP removal. Modelling the time&#8208;resolved production of formic acid provides an estimated upper limit of 2&#8197;s&#8722;1 for the rate coefficient of KHP decomposition to formic acid+acetone.

         <title>A Thioether&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allyl Halides and Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling of allyl bromides and arylboronic acids was developed using a designer thioether catalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of a key sulfoxonium ylide that binds to the arylboronic acid and triggers 1,2&#8208;aryl migration.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis. In these reactions transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Herein, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid. The cross&#8208;coupling event occurred readily under mild condition in the presence of a weak inorganic base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a sulfonium ylide mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis. In these reactions transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon-carbon bonds. Herein, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid. The cross-coupling event occurred readily under mild condition in the presence of a weak inorganic base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a sulfonium ylide mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Doping Effect on Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Ligated Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of single and multiple gold atom doping on optical properties of silver nanoclusters was analysed in linear and nonlinear regime experimentally and with TD&#8208;DFT simulations. Ag24Au1 nanocluster is a robust emitter, with strongly enhanced luminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness with respect to Ag25 parent nanocluster.







Abstract
Noble metal nanoclusters allow for the atomically&#8208;precise control of their composition. However, to create nanoclusters with pre&#8208;defined optical properties, comprehensive description of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations (TD&#8208;DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag25&#8722;xAux(DMBT)18 nanoclusters where x=0, 1 and 5&#8211;10. For Ag24Au1(DMBT)18 we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non&#8208;linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically&#8208;precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incredibly strong C&#8722;X bonds such as those in aryl fluorides are catalytically cleaved using an anionic Rh&#8722;Ga photoredox catalyst. Excitation of the bimetallic complex with violet light generates a potent photoreductant that is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer to even electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides that ultimately results in substrate hydrodefluorination.







Abstract
An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoromethylarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H2, a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh0 intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H2 and base as the terminal reductant.

         <title>Polycyclic Hydrocarbons from [4n]Annulenes: Correlation versus Hybridization Forces in the Formation of Diradicaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptual electronic structure trip from [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromatics to diradicaloids and to more hierarchical complex molecular shapes made by internal covalent hybridization of the peripheral [4n] &#960;&#8208;electron circuit is described. Focus is on the underlying physical organic chemistry implications.







Abstract
The conceptual connections between [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, disjoint orbitals, correlation energy, pro&#8208;aromaticity and diradical character for a variety of extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, including some salient recent examples of nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic radicals, are provided based on their [4n]annulene peripheries. The realization of such structure&#8211;property relationships has led to a beneficial pedagogic exercise establishing design guidelines for diradicaloids. The antiaromatic fingerprint of the [4n]annulene peripheries upon orbital interactions due to internal covalent connectors gives insights into the diradicaloid property of a diversity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules that have fascinated chemists recently.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metal Clusters on 2D Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets have been synthesized by a universal sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy. The resultant catalyst shows unique chemical state and nanostructures, enabling a high catalytic activity, selectivity, poison tolerance and stability for the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
A sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy is presented for the synthesis of fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 (SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2) nanosheets. This synthesis features the introduction of the sulfhydryl group in monomicelles to finely realize the controllable co&#8208;assembly process of Pt precursors within ordered mesostructures. The resultant SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows uniform SAL Pt clusters (&#8776;1.2&#8197;nm) anchored in ultrathin 2D nanosheets (&#8776;7&#8197;nm) with a high surface area (139&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), a large pore size (&#8776;25&#8197;nm) and a high dispersion (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Moreover, this strategy is universal for the synthesis of other SAL metal clusters (Pd and Au) on 2D mTiO2 with high exposure and accessibility. When used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene, the SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows a high catalytic activity (TOF up to 2424&#8197;h&#8722;1), 100&#8201;% selectivity for 4&#8208;aminostyrene, good stability, and anti&#8208;resistance to thiourea poisoning under relatively mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 10&#8197;bar).

Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for those highly reducing oxy&#8208;borylenes. Their ability as photoreductants is then showcased by the detosylation of tosylated anilines and the dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl as well as alkyl halides under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
While the range of accessible borylenes has significantly broadened over the last decade, applications remain limited. Herein, we present tricoordinate oxy&#8208;borylenes as potent photoreductants that can be readily activated by visible light. Facile oxidation of CAAC stabilized oxy&#8208;borylenes (CAAC)(IPr2Me2)BOR (R=TMS, CH2CH2C6H5, CH2CH2(4&#8208;F)C6H4) to their corresponding radical cations is achieved with mildly oxidizing ferrocenium ion. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for such oxy&#8208;borylenes placing them among the strongest organic super electron donors. Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.

         <title>Mechanistic Origin of Favorable Substituent Effects in Excellent Cu Cyclam Based HNO Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties and Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A computational study reproduced their various experimental reactivities and revealed subtle and sometimes unexpected interwoven effects of steric and electronic factors, which offer the first mechanistic understanding of substituent effects for excellent HNO sensors to facilitate future development.







Abstract
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties. Metal complexes and derivatives are widely used to make excellent HNO sensors. However, their favorable mechanistic origins are largely unknown. Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A quantum chemical study of Cu cyclams with various substitutions was performed, which reproduced diverse experimental reactivities. Structural, electronic, and energetic profiles along reaction pathways show the importance of HNO binding and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism for HNO reaction. Results reveal that steric effect is primary and electronic factor is secondary (if the redox potential is sufficient), but their interwoven effects can lead to unexpected reactivity, which looks mysterious experimentally but can be explained computationally. This work suggests rational substituent design ideas and recommends a theoretical study of a new design to save time and cost due to its subtle effect.

         <title>Selectively Coupling Ru Single Atoms to PtNi Concavities for High&#8208;Performance Methanol Oxidation via d&#8208;Band Center Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom&#8208;cavity coupling enables the superior activity and stability of Ru single atoms tailored PtNi nano&#8208;catalysts towards methanol oxidation, synthesized by the selective ALD. The modulated d&#8208;band center and higher diffusion barrier accounts for the unparallel activity and stability on the Ru single atoms coupled to PtNi cavities, respectively.







Abstract
Single atom tailored metal nanoparticles represent a new type of catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a single atom&#8208;cavity coupling strategy to regulate performance of single atom tailored nano&#8208;catalysts. Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) was conducted to deposit Ru single atoms on the surface concavities of PtNi nanoparticles (Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi). Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi exhibits a record&#8208;high activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with 2.01&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt. Also, Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi showcases a significant durability with only 16&#8201;% activity loss. Operando electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations demonstrate Ru single atoms coupled to cavities accelerate the CO removal by regulating d&#8208;band center position. Further, the high diffusion barrier of Ru single atoms in concavities accounts for excellent stability. The developed Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi via single atom&#8208;cavity coupling opens an encouraging pathway to design highly efficient single atom&#8208;based (electro)catalysts.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Trap Engineering toward Remarkable Crystallographic Reorientation and Efficient Cation Migration of Zn Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special design of anion&#8208;trap additive can greatly enhance the stability and capacity of the Zn ion batteries via modulating preferred Zn crystal plane and enabling fast Zn ion migration.







Abstract
Zn batteries are considered as potential candidates in future power sources, however suffer problems of rampant dendrite/by&#8208;product on Zn anodes, torpid Zn2+ transfer/diffusion and poor energy density. Inspired by the host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, an anion&#8208;trap agent &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4&#8722; is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevating the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;&#8208;CD@ClO4&#8722; complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth. Above combined functions lead to substantial enhancement in long&#8208;term stability and cell capacity, as proved by 10&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn symmetric cells and 57&#8201;% capacity increasement of Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) compared with that of pure Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte.

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)/phosphine catalysis system enabled versatile meta&#8208;arene C&#8722;H glycosylation by &#963;&#8208;activation. Thus, easily accessible glycosyl bromide donors furnished 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;aryl glycosides via robust ruthenium(II) catalysis under exceedingly mild conditions.







Abstract
The prevalence of C&#8208;aryl glycosides in biologically active natural products and approved drugs has long motivated the development of efficient strategies for their selective synthesis. Cross&#8208;couplings have been frequently used, but largely relied on palladium catalyst with prefunctionalized substrates, while ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;aryl glycoside preparation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we disclose a versatile ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation to access meta&#8208;C&#8208;aryl glycosides from readily available glycosyl halide donors. The robustness of the ruthenium catalysis was reflected by mild reaction conditions, outstanding levels of anomeric selectivity and exclusive meta&#8208;site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Chiral Nanozymes for Enantioselective Biological Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are defined as nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. This Minireview provides an overview of recent developments in chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis, with an outlook on the opportunities and trends in this research area.







Abstract
As a neat combination of the characteristics of enzymatic activity and nanomaterials, nanozymes have attracted much attention. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, substrate selectivity is often overlooked in the construction of nanozymes. With their subtly evolving structures, natural enzymes generally possess high selectivity for chiral substrates which play important roles in biosynthesis and biomedical applications. However, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of recent advances in strategies for the synthesis of chiral nanozymes and their enantioselective biological catalysis. We further focus on current challenges, potential solutions, and future developing trends of chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis. There is plenty of room to explore. This Minireview will provide new insights into the development of chiral nanozymes and their applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Modulated Release of a Cytotoxic Photosensitizer Using Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cytotoxic photosensitizer encapsulated within a redox&#8208;sensitive biocompatible nanogel (IrNG) exhibited good biocompatibility and stability in the dark. It showed cancer&#8208;selective cytotoxicity upon photoirradiation through the dual&#8208;modulated hyperoxidation of disulfide bonds by intracellular glutathione (GSH) and photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS).







Abstract
Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hard to distinguish from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.

         <title>Atroposelective Electrophilic Sulfenylation of N&#8208;Aryl Aminoquinone Derivatives Catalyzed by Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives catalyzed by a new chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide has been achieved. Axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is a key parameter for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis. DFT calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity.







Abstract
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions. Various axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. A class of relatively flexible stereogenic C&#8722;N axes was easily constructed. The experimental results and a computational study suggested that an intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity and underscored the importance of catalyst rigidity in this sulfenylation reaction.
