         <title>Chemical Genetics Reveals a Role of Squalene Synthase in TGF&#946; Signaling and Cardiomyogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis of the mesoderm cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version KY&#8208;I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal structure classification of copper&#8208;based sulphides as a tool for the design of inorganic functional materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties in inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth&#8208;abundant copper sulphides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulphides, associated with block&#160;  p  &#160;and/or&#160;  d  &#160;elements, is based on their crystallographic features and the analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimating some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) by considering only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies essentially on recent work in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics and thorough crystal structure investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart 131I labeled self&#8208;illuminating photosensitizers for deep tumor imaging guided therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulating photosensitizers (PS) by Cerenkov radiation (CR) can overcome the light penetration limitation in traditional photodynamic therapy. However, separate injection of radiopharmaceuticals and PS could not guarantee their efficient interaction in tumor areas, while co&#8208;delivery of radionuclides and PS face the problem of nonnegligible phototoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we developed a  131  I&#8208;labled smart photosensitizer which was composed of pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (photosensitizer), diisopropylamino group (pH sensitive group),  131  I&#8208;labled tyrosine group (CR donor) as well as polyethylene glycol, and can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (  131  I&#8208;sPS NPs). The  131  I&#8208;sPS NPs showed low phototoxicity in normal tissues due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, but could selfproduce reactive oxygen species in tumor sites upon its disassembly. Upon intravenous injection, it showed great tumor inhibition capability in subcutaneous 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing Balb/c mice and orthotopic VX2 liver tumor bearing rabbit. We believed  131  I&#8208;sPS NPs could expand the application of CR and provide an effective strategy for deep tumor theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Pd0&#8208; and PdII&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations: Enantioselective Heck and Nucleopalladation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successive cyclization and cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl aryl iodides and alkyne&#8208;appended nucleophiles via an enantioselective domino&#8208;Heck and regioselective nucleopalladation is reported. Heterocycles originated from N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles were successful in conjunction with the enantioselective formation of dihydrobenzofurans, indolines, chromans, indanes, and polycyclic indolines.







Abstract
An enantioselective consecutive cyclization/coupling process, catalyzed by palladium is reported. Stereoinduction arises from an enantioselective carbopalladation, generating an intermediate which promotes a nucleopalladation step. The dual cyclization sequence was compatible with a variety of alkyne&#8208;tethered oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles, and a variety of alkenyl&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, to forge numerous bisheterocycles in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Gradient Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel Membranes as High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from an inherent high conductivity, excellent ion selectivity of 3D charged polymer networks, and a charge&#8208;induced ionic&#8208;diode gradient effect, all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel gradient membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion.







Abstract
Emerging asymmetric ionic membranes consisting of two different porous membranes show great superiority in harvesting clean and renewable osmotic energy. The main barriers constraining their applications are incompatible interfaces and a low interfacial ionic transport efficiency, which are detrimental to the long&#8208;term stability and improvement of the power density. Here, continuous&#8208;gradient all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. Besides an inherent high ion conductivity and excellent ion selectivity, the anti&#8208;swelling polyelectrolyte gradient membranes preserve the ionic diode effect of the asymmetric membranes to facilitate one&#8208;way ion diffusion but circumvent adverse interfacial effects. In consequence, they can present ultrahigh power densities of 7.87&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing seawater and river water, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Nonacyclic Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Based on Ladder&#8208;Thiaborin Exhibiting Narrowband Sky&#8208;Blue Emission with Accelerated Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms was developed as a narrowband sky&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitter for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A design concept for inducing a synergetic effect on the luminescence function by exquisite multi&#8208;heteroatom hybridization is presented.







Abstract
Developing organic luminophores with unique capability of strong narrowband emission is both crucial and challenging for the further advancement of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system (BSBS&#8208;N1), which was strategically embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, was developed as a new multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. Narrowband sky&#8208;blue emission with a peak at 478&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum of 24&#8197;nm, and photoluminescence quantum yield of 89&#8201;% was obtained with BSBS&#8208;N1. Additionally, the spin&#8208;orbit coupling was enhanced by incorporating two sulfur atoms, thereby facilitating the spin&#8208;flipping process between the excited triplet and singlet states. OLEDs based on BSBS&#8208;N1 as a sky&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter achieved a high maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 21.0&#8201;%, with improved efficiency roll&#8208;off.

&lt;p&gt;Developing organic luminophores with unique capability of strong narrowband emission is both crucial and challenging for the further advancement of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a nanographitic fused-nonacyclic &#960;-system (&lt;b&gt;BSBS-N1&lt;/b&gt;), which was strategically embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, was developed as a new multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitter. Narrowband sky-blue emission with a peak at 478&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum of 24&#8197;nm, and photoluminescence quantum yield of 89&#8201;% was obtained with &lt;b&gt;BSBS-N1&lt;/b&gt;. Additionally, the spin-orbit coupling was enhanced by incorporating two sulfur atoms, thereby facilitating the spin-flipping process between the excited triplet and singlet states. OLEDs based on &lt;b&gt;BSBS-N1&lt;/b&gt; as a sky-blue MR-TADF emitter achieved a high maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 21.0&#8201;%, with improved efficiency roll-off.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;C Biaryl atropisomers are important because of their prevalence in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8208;C biaryl atropisomers via stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the synthesis of N&#8208;C axially chiral biaryl molecules is presented. A broad spectrum of the N&#8208;C axially chiral compounds was afforded with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) and good yields (up to 98%). The practicality of this reaction was validated in the synthesis of useful biological molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Various Stacking Patterns of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Cocrystals: Insight on&#160;Competitive Intermolecular Interactions and Control of Stacking Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We first demonstrate the rational control over the stacking patterns in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular assemblies using chemical modification. A target system is a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystal composed of 2&#8208;pyrrolidone (Py) and chloranilic acid (CA) with 2:1 composition (  PyCA  ). X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that various weak intersheet interactions give rise to a variety of metastable overlapping patterns comprised of the 2D assemblies mainly formed via hydrogen bonds, affording reversible and irreversible structural phase transitions. We successfully prepared cocrystals of Py and anilic acids bearing different halogens, in which 2D assemblies isostructural with those observed in  PyCA  exhibit various overlapping patterns. The order of stability for each overlapping pattern estimated using theoretical calculations of the intermolecular interactions did not completely coincide with those indicated by our experimental results, which can be explained by considering the entropic effect, i.e., the molecular motion of Py as detected using nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Molecular Sieve for High Selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Acetylene on Isolated Single Pd Atom Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation in an ethylene&#8208;rich gas stream is of great industrial importance. Herein, we construct isolated single Pd atom in a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (POMOF). The unique internal environment allows this POMOF to separate acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and confine it close to the single Pd atom. After semi&#8208;hydrogenation, the resulting ethylene is preferentially discharged from the pores, achieving a selectivity of 92.6%. First&#8208;principles simulations reveal that the adsorbed acetylene/ethylene molecules form hydrogen bond networks with oxygen atoms of SiW  12  O  40  4&#8208;  and create  dynamic  confinement regions, which preferentially release the produced ethylene. Besides, at the Pd site, the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene exhibits a higher reaction energy barrier than the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined advantages of POMOF and single Pd atom provides an effective approach for the regulation of semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxially Growth of Heterostructured   SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 with High Valence Mn3+/4+ for  I mproved Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterostructured catalysts show outstanding performance in electrochemical reactions for their beneficial interfacial properties. However, the rational design of heterostructured catalysts with the desired interfacial properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics is challenging. Herein, we developed a SrMn  3  O  6&#8722;x  &#8208;SrMnO  3  (SMO  x  &#8208;SMO) heterostructure through epitaxial growth, which demonstrated excellent electrocatalyst performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of high valence Mn  3+/4+  is beneficial for promoting a positive shift in the d&#8208;band center position, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and resulting in improved catalytic activity. When  SMO  x  &#8208;SMO  was applied as air&#8208;electrode catalyst in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, a high output voltage and power density was achieved, with performance comparable to a battery prepared with Pt/C&#8208;IrO  2  air&#8208;electrode catalysts albeit with much better cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis over a multifunctional bilayer paper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis as one of the future environment technologies has been investigated for decades. Despite great efforts in catalyst engineering, the widely used powder dispersion and photoelectrode systems are still restricted by sluggish interfacial mass transfer and chemical processes. Here we develop a scalable bilayer paper from commercialized TiO  2  and carbon nanomaterials, self&#8208;supported at gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid interfaces for photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species can be facilitated through fast oxygen diffusion over triphase interfaces, while the interfacial photothermal effect promotes the following free radical reaction for advanced oxidation of phenol. Under full spectrum irradiation, the triphase system shows 13 times higher reaction rate than diphase controlled system, achieving 88.4% mineralization of high concentration phenol within 90 min full spectrum irradiation. The bilayer paper also exhibits high stability over 40 times cycling experiments and sunlight driven feasibility, showing potentials for large scale photocatalytic applications by being further integrated into a triphase flow reactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Data&#8208;driven Design of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins: Database and Hierarchical Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most powerful asymmetric transformations in molecular synthesis. Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data&#8208;driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few&#8208;shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening.</dc:description>

Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time- and resource-consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data-driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few-shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating local electron density of iron single site by nitrogen vacancy for efficient photo&#8208;Fenton&#160;process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H2O2  activation in Fenton&#8208;like process is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms. However, the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe1&#8208;Nv/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H2O2  under visible light illumination. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2  conversion efficiency. Therefore, the optimized single atom catalyst exhibiting a higher ciprofloxacin degradation activity, which was up to 18 times that of pristine CN.</dc:description>

         <title>PtSe2/Pt heterointerface with reduced coordination for boosted hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PtSe  2  is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe  2  /Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe  2  , enabled by an in&#8208;situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H  &#8226;  intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe  2  /Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA/cm  2  and a Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Double double to double perovskite transformations in ternary manganese oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of cation ordering in ABX  3  perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we show that thermal transformations of AA&#8217;BB&#8217;O  6  double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A  0.5  A&#8217;  0.5  )  2  BB&#8217;O  6  double perovskites with fully disordered A/A&#8217; cations can be achieved under pressure in CaMnMnWO  6  and SmMnMnTaO  6  , enabling both polymorphs of each material to be recovered. This leads to a dramatic switch of magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order in double double perovskite CaMnMnWO  6  to spin glass behaviour in the highly frustrated double perovskite polymorph. Comparison of double double and double perovskite polymorphs of other materials will enable effects of cation order and disorder on other properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity to be explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Linkers for Protein Chemical Synthesis through Solid&#8208;Phase Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18612-18618, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic approach was developed for the synthesis of proteins by solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation based on a tailor&#8208;made phosphatase&#8208;cleavable linker (see scheme). The size of the enzyme used directly correlates with the efficiency of the release of the synthesized protein. The method was applied to the synthesis of a 15&#8197;kDa polypeptide, the longest sequence ever synthesized through solid&#8208;phase native chemical ligation.







Abstract
The total synthesis of long proteins requires the assembly of multiple fragments through successive ligations. The need for intermediate purification steps is a strong limitation, particularly in terms of overall yield. One solution to this problem would be solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation (SPCL), for which a first peptide segment must be immobilized on a SPCL&#8208;compatible solid support through a linker that can be cleaved under very mild conditions to release the assembled protein. The cleavage of SPCL linkers has previously required chemical conditions sometimes incompatible with sensitive protein targets. Herein, we describe an alternative enzymatic approach to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support were key to the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the assembly of three peptide segments on the basis of native chemical ligation to afford a 15&#8197;kDa polypeptide.

Polymers exhibiting near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence are prepared from four boron&#8208;difluoride&#8208;curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) and subsequent antibody conjugation enabled near&#8208;infrared immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting polymers were prepared using four boron&#8208;difluoride&#8208;curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Well&#8208;defined polymers with molecular weights of &#8776;20&#8197;kDa and dispersities &lt;1.07 were produced and exhibited near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission in solution and in the solid state with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) as high as 0.72 and 0.18, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy revealed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in polymers containing highly planar dopants, whereas room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence dominated with twisted species. Density functional theory demonstrated that rotation about the donor&#8211;acceptor linker can give rise to TADF, even where none would be expected based on calculations using ground&#8208;state geometries. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) gave NIR&#8208;emissive nanoparticles, and conjugation of these Pdots with antibodies enabled immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast&#8208;cancer cells.

         <title>Shadow Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy of Single Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18742-18749, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (SECL) microscopy is based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting layer, allowing to resolve subcellular organelles such as single functional mitochondria with remarkably sharp negative optical contrast. The statistical analysis of colocalization between SECL spots with the MitoTracker Deep Red dye and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH fluorescent biomarkers validates the reported methodology.

Mitochondria are the subcellular bioenergetic organelles. The analysis of their morphology and topology is essential to provide useful information on their activity and metabolism. Herein, we report a label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting reactive layer to image single living mitochondria deposited on the electrode surface. The ECL mechanism of the freely&#8208;diffusing [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye with the sacrificial tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine coreactant restrains the light&#8208;emitting region to a micrometric thickness allowing to visualize individual mitochondria with a remarkable sharp negative optical contrast. The imaging approach named &#8220;shadow ECL&#8221; (SECL) reflects the negative imprint of the local diffusional hindrance of the ECL reagents by each mitochondrion. The statistical analysis of the colocalization of the shadow ECL spots with the functional mitochondria revealed by classical fluorescent biomarkers, MitoTracker Deep Red and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH, validates the reported methodology. The versatility and extreme sensitivity of the approach are further demonstrated by visualizing single mitochondria, which remain hardly detectable with the usual biomarkers. Finally, by alleviating problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with conventional microscopy methods, SECL microscopy should find promising applications in the imaging of subcellular structures.

We have developed PA&#8208;HD, a new sulfur&#8208;substituted dye platform exhibiting enhanced properties for photoacoustic probe development. To demonstrate generalizability, we employed PA&#8208;HD to access probes for beta&#8208;galactosidase and nitroreductase activities, as well as H2O2. Each probe was tested in live cells and in vivo. For instance, the H2O2 probe was employed to visualize oxidative stress in an Alzheimer's disease model.







Abstract
Most photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents are based on the repurposing of existing fluorescent dye platforms that exhibit non&#8208;optimal properties for PA applications. Herein, we introduce PA&#8208;HD, a new dye scaffold optimized for PA probe development that features a 4.8&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity and a red&#8208;shift of the &#955;abs from 690&#8197;nm to 745&#8197;nm to enable ratiometric imaging. Computational modeling was used to elucidate the origin of these enhanced properties. To demonstrate the generalizability of our remodeling efforts, we developed three probes for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal), nitroreductase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR), and H2O2 (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H2O2). We generated two cancer models to evaluate PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR. We employed a murine model of Alzheimer's disease to test PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H2O2. There, we observed a PA signal increase at 735&#8197;nm of 1.79&#177;0.20&#8208;fold relative to background, indicating the presence of oxidative stress. These results were confirmed via ratiometric calibration, which was not possible using the parent HD platform.

         <title>Development of Continuous Flow Systems to Access Secondary Amines Through Previously Incompatible Biocatalytic Cascades**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18660-18665, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of continuous flow reactors enabled previously inaccessible enzyme combinations in multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions. This included the combination of oxidases with aminating biocatalysts (transaminase/reductive aminase) and was extended to the continuous in situ biocatalytic generation of amino donors for the reductive aminase.







Abstract
A key aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in a controlled and selective way. As biocatalytic cascades get more complex, reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions. Here a number of continuous flow systems were used to overcome batch incompatibility, thus allowing for successful biocatalytic cascades. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, reactive carbonyl intermediates were generated in situ using alcohol oxidases, then passed directly to a series of packed&#8208;bed modules containing different aminating biocatalysts which accordingly produced a range of structurally distinct amines. The method was expanded to employ a batch incompatible sequential amination cascade via an oxidase/transaminase/imine reductase sequence, introducing different amine reagents at each step without cross&#8208;reactivity. The combined approaches allowed for the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O&#8208;methylnorbelladine.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Decorated Amorphous/Crystalline RuO2 with Rich Oxygen Vacancies: A Robust pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Na&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies was developed as a highly active pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. Its high acid corrosion and oxidation resistance under the OER conditions result in its extremely high acidic catalytic stability. Theoretical calculations reveal the formation of Na&#8208;doped and oxygen vacancy&#8208;containing structures is the key to increasing the OER activity of RuO2.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction for many electrochemical devices. To date, many OER electrocatalysts function well in alkaline media, but exhibit poor performances in neutral and acidic media, especially the acidic stability. Herein, sodium&#8208;decorated amorphous/crystalline RuO2 with rich oxygen vacancies (a/c&#8208;RuO2) was developed as a pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. The a/c&#8208;RuO2 shows remarkable resistance to acid corrosion and oxidation during OER, which leads to an extremely high catalytic stability, as confirmed by a negligible overpotential increase after continuously catalyzing OER for 60&#8197;h at pH=1. Besides, a/c&#8208;RuO2 also exhibits superior OER activities to commercial RuO2 and most reported OER catalysts under all pH conditions. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Na dopant and oxygen vacancy in RuO2 weakens the adsorption strength of the OER intermediates by engineering the d&#8208;band center, thereby lowering the energy barrier for OER.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;electron Microscopy Imaging of Alzheimer's Amyloid&#8208;beta 42 Oligomer Displayed on a Functionally and Structurally Relevant Scaffold</title>

A functional and structural A&#946;42&#8208;oligomer equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin, shares major structural, functional, and biological properties with Alzheimer's wild&#8208;type A&#946;42 oligomers. Cryo&#8208;EM studies reveal that the &#945;HL&#8208;displayed oligomers structurally remain in a well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, providing a stable mimetic antigen for the development of conformation&#8208;specific antibodies.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;) oligomers are pathogenic species of amyloid aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Like certain protein toxins, A&#946; oligomers permeabilize cellular membranes, presumably through a pore formation mechanism. Owing to their structural and stoichiometric heterogeneity, the structure of these pores remains to be characterized. We studied a functional A&#946;42&#8208;pore equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin. Our data reveal A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers to share major structural, functional, and biological properties with wild&#8208;type A&#946;42&#8208;pores. Single&#8208;particle cryo&#8208;EM analysis of A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers (with an overall 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution) reveals the A&#946;42&#8208;pore region to be intrinsically flexible. The A&#946;42&#8208;&#945;HL oligomers will allow many of the features of the wild&#8208;type amyloid oligomers to be studied that cannot be otherwise, and may be a highly specific antigen for the development of immuno&#8208;base diagnostics and therapies.

Owing to their structural and stoichiometric heterogeneity, the structure of these pores remains to be characterized. We studied a functional A&#946;42-pore equivalent, created by fusing A&#946;42 to the oligomerizing, soluble domain of the &#945;-hemolysin (&#945;HL) toxin. Our data reveal A&#946;42-&#945;HL oligomers to share major structural, functional, and biological properties with wild-type A&#946;42-pores. Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of A&#946;42-&#945;HL oligomers (with an overall 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution) reveals the A&#946;42-pore region to be intrinsically flexible. The A&#946;42-&#945;HL oligomers will allow many of the features of the wild-type amyloid oligomers to be studied that cannot be otherwise, and may be a highly specific antigen for the development of immuno-base diagnostics and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Remote Site&#8208;Selective Radical C(sp3)&#8722;H Monodeuteration of Amides using D2O</title>

Radical C&#8722;H Deuteration: A environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for remote radical C&#8722;H deuteration at various unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds including primary C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms for the &#948;&#8208;deuteration of primary amines, &#947;&#8208;deuteration of aliphatic acids and &#945;&#8208;deuteration of secondary amines has been developed.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into biologically active compounds is of high interest in pharmaceutical industry. We present a mild and environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for the remote selective radical C&#8722;H monodeuteration of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in various amides with inexpensive heavy water (D2O) as the deuterium source. The method uses the easily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonyl moiety as an N&#8208;radical precursor that generates the remote C&#8208;radical via site&#8208;selective 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Methyl thioglycolate, that readily exchanges its proton with D2O, serves as the radical deuteration reagent and as a chain&#8208;carrier. The highly site&#8208;selective monodeuteration has been applied to different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds and also to the deuteration of C&#8722;H bonds next to heteroatoms. The potential utility of this method is further demonstrated by the site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems Based on AIEgen&#8208;branched Rotaxane Dendrimers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18761-18768, August 16, 2021. </description>

A novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting system based on AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers has been successfully constructed which displayed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty&#8208;one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen&#8208;branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent&#8208;induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) process. Moreover, novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed based on these AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers, which revealed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Diarylation/Annulation of Benzoic Acids: Facile Access to Multi&#8208;Aryl Spirobifluorenes as Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>

Diarylation/annulation of benzoic acids is accomplished for the first time through an iridium catalyst system. This method streamlines access to a series of novel pure hydrocarbon hosts for phosphorescent OLEDs, which exhibit high external quantum efficiencies up to 27.3&#8201;%. This work not only shows the potential of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as hosts, but also offers a new synthetic strategy for these hosts.







Abstract
Herein disclosed is the first example of diarylation/annulation of benzoic acids via an iridium catalyst system. This protocol provides a step&#8208;economic and highly efficient pathway to 1&#8208;aryl, 1,3&#8208;diaryl, 1,7&#8208;diaryl and 1,3,7&#8208;triaryl spirobifluorenes from readily available starting materials. The applications of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as pure hydrocarbon (PHC) hosts for red, green, and blue (RGB) phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) were explored. Due to high triplet energies, 1,3&#8208;diaryl spirobifluorenes exhibit the potential as the host material of blue PhOLEDs. 1,7&#8208;Diaryl spirobifluorene can serve as the host of green PhOLEDs. 1,3,7&#8208;Triaryl spirobifluorene is a high&#8208;performance host for red PhOLEDs, which exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 27.3&#8201;%. This work not only exemplifies the great potential of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as PHC hosts, but also offers a new approach for the synthesis of these PHC hosts.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network Determines the Early Photoisomerization Processes of Cph1 and AnPixJ Phytochromes</title>

QM/MM calculations reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond networks interacting with the PCB chromophore govern the distinct excited&#8208;state relaxations of red&#8208;light photoreceptors Cph1 and AnPixJ. The present results contribute to decipher the natural evolution of both cyanobacteriochromes and phytochromes.







Abstract
Phytochrome proteins are light receptors that play a pivotal role in regulating the life cycles of plants and microorganisms. Intriguingly, while cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and cyanobacteriochrome AnPixJ use the same phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore to absorb light, their excited&#8208;state behavior is very different. We employ multiscale calculations to rationalize the different early photoisomerization mechanisms of PCB in Cph1 and AnPixJ. We found that their electronic S1, T1, and S0 potential minima exhibit distinct geometric and electronic structures due to different hydrogen bond networks with the protein environment. These specific interactions influence the S1 electronic structures along the photoisomerization paths, ultimately leading to internal conversion in Cph1 but intersystem crossing in AnPixJ. This explains why the excited&#8208;state relaxation in AnPixJ is much slower (ca. 100&#8197;ns) than in Cph1 (ca. 30&#8197;ps). Further, we predict that efficient internal conversion in AnPixJ can be achieved upon protonating the carboxylic group that interacts with PCB.

All the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry and the versatility of the tetrazine moiety have been combined in a novel exchange reaction: The nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) with phenols and alkyl thiols. Not only sophisticated structures could be easily synthesized, but more importantly, post&#8208;functionalization by IEDDA or photolysis of the compounds show that SNTz unleashes a huge potential of applications.







Abstract
A dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines (SNTz) is presented herein. It combines all the advantages of dynamic covalent chemistry with the versatility of the tetrazine moiety. Indeed, libraries of compounds or sophisticated molecular structures can be easily obtained, which are susceptible to post&#8208;functionalization by inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which also locks the exchange. Additionally, the structures obtained can be disassembled upon the application of the right stimulus, either UV irradiation or a suitable chemical reagent. Moreover, SNTz is compatible with the imine chemistry of anilines. The high potential of this methodology has been proved by building two responsive supramolecular systems: A macrocycle that displays a light&#8208;induced release of acetylcholine; and a truncated [4+6] tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent fluorescent cage, which is disassembled by thiols unless it is post&#8208;stabilized by IEDDA.

A redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) system is presented. This system decouples the catalyst from the electrode, which gives the system huge versatility in catalyst design, loading and gas flow. By modifying the catalyst, either hydrazine or ammonium can be obtained selectively. The process has achieved ammonium production yield of 25.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 61&#8197;ppm ammonium can be accumulated by continuous operation.







Abstract
This work presents a redox&#8208;mediated electrolytic nitrogen reduction reaction (RM&#8208;eNRR) using polyoxometalate (POM) as the electron and proton carrier which frees the TiO2&#8208;based catalyst from the electrode and shifts the reduction of nitrogen to a reactor tank. The RM&#8208;eNRR process has achieved an ammonium production yield of 25.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 or 5.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an ammonium concentration of 6.7&#8197;ppm. With high catalyst loading, 61.0&#8197;ppm ammonium was accumulated in the electrolyte upon continuous operation, which is the highest concentration detected for ambient eNRR so far. The mechanism underlying the RM&#8208;eNRR was scrutinized both experimentally and computationally to delineate the POM&#8208;mediated charge transfer and hydrogenation process of nitrogen molecule on the catalyst. RM&#8208;eNRR is expected to provide an implementable solution to overcome the limitations in the conventional eNRR process.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Purely Covalent Cage with Homochirality by Imine Formation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18815-18820, August 16, 2021. </description>

A chiral, anionic tetrahedral cage was self&#8208;assembled in water by condensing an anionic trisbenzaldehyde and a trisamine in a [4+4] manner, enantioselectively, with the help of templating by a chiral guest. The tetrahedron is remarkably stable and can accommodate a variety of guest molecules when in water.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of host molecules in aqueous media via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is well developed. However, the preparation of purely covalent counterparts in water has remained a formidable task. An anionic tetrahedron cage was successfully self&#8208;assembled in a [4+4] manner by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in water. Even although each individual imine bond is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze in water, the tetrahedron is remarkably stable or inert due to multivalence. The tetrahedral cages, as well as its neutral counterparts dissolved in organic solvent, have homochirality, namely that their four propeller&#8208;shaped trisformyl residues adopt the same rotational conformation. The cage is able to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of guest molecules in water. When a chiral guest was recognized, the formation of one enantiomer of the cage became more favored relative to the other. As a consequence, the cage could be produced in an enantioselective manner. The tetrahedron is able to maintain its chirality after removal of the chiral guest&#8212;probably on account of the cooperative occurrence of intramolecular forces that restrict the intramolecular flipping of phenyl units in the cage framework.

A family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by actinobacteria and named gausemycins showed pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Gausemycins have a unique peptide core that includes 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb), chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), O&#8208;arabinosylated tyrosine, and N&#948;&#8208;acylated ornithine residues (see structure). Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences to known antibiotics.







Abstract
We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by Streptomyces sp. INA&#8208;Ac&#8208;5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins&#8197;A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of d&#8208;amino acids, lack of the Ca2+&#8208;binding Asp&#8208;X&#8208;Asp&#8208;Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn), and N&#8208;acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco&#8208; and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca2+&#8208;dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Detected Pump&#8211;Probe Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18867-18875, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy detected by fluorescence is introduced. Combining sensitive fluorescence detection with ultrafast pulse&#8208;limited time resolution, this approach provides a complementary technique to standard transient absorption.







Abstract
We introduce a new approach to transient spectroscopy, fluorescence&#8208;detected pump&#8211;probe (F&#8208;PP) spectroscopy, that overcomes several limitations of traditional PP. F&#8208;PP suppresses excited&#8208;state absorption, provides background&#8208;free detection, removes artifacts resulting from pump&#8211;pulse scattering, from non&#8208;resonant solvent response, or from coherent pulse overlap, and allows unique extraction of excited&#8208;state dynamics under certain conditions. Despite incoherent detection, time resolution of F&#8208;PP is given by the duration of the laser pulses, independent of the fluorescence lifetime. We describe the working principle of F&#8208;PP and provide its theoretical description. Then we illustrate specific features of F&#8208;PP by direct comparison with PP, theoretically and experimentally. For this purpose, we investigate, with both techniques, a molecular squaraine heterodimer, core&#8211;shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, and fluorescent protein mCherry. F&#8208;PP is broadly applicable to chemical systems in various environments and in different spectral regimes.

     alt="Fluorescence-Detected Pump&#8211;Probe Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafast pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy detected by fluorescence is introduced. Combining sensitive fluorescence detection with ultrafast pulse-limited time resolution, this approach provides a complementary technique to standard transient absorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new approach to transient spectroscopy, fluorescence-detected pump&#8211;probe (F-PP) spectroscopy, that overcomes several limitations of traditional PP. F-PP suppresses excited-state absorption, provides background-free detection, removes artifacts resulting from pump&#8211;pulse scattering, from non-resonant solvent response, or from coherent pulse overlap, and allows unique extraction of excited-state dynamics under certain conditions. Despite incoherent detection, time resolution of F-PP is given by the duration of the laser pulses, independent of the fluorescence lifetime. We describe the working principle of F-PP and provide its theoretical description. Then we illustrate specific features of F-PP by direct comparison with PP, theoretically and experimentally. For this purpose, we investigate, with both techniques, a molecular squaraine heterodimer, core&#8211;shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, and fluorescent protein mCherry. F-PP is broadly applicable to chemical systems in various environments and in different spectral regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Rhodium Complexes with Chiral Diene Ligands via Diastereoselective Coordination and Their Application in the Asymmetric Insertion of Diazo Compounds into E&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18712-18720, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium complexes with bulky racemic dienes were synthesized and separated into pure enantiomers by diastereoselective coordination with a chiral auxiliary ligand. The optimal structure of the auxiliary ligand and the selectivity of coordination were predicted by density functional theory calculations. The resulting chiral complexes catalyze the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A new method for the synthesis of chiral diene rhodium catalysts is introduced. The readily available racemic tetrafluorobenzobarrelene complexes [(R2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 were separated into two enantiomers via selective coordination of one of them with the auxiliary S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline ligand. One of the resulting chiral complexes with an exceptionally bulky diene ligand [(R,R&#8208;iPr2&#8208;TFB)RhCl]2 was an efficient catalyst for the asymmetric insertion of diazoesters into B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds giving the functionalized organoboranes and silanes with high yields (79&#8211;97&#8201;%) and enantiomeric purity (87&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The stereoselectivity of separation via auxiliary ligand and that of the catalytic reaction was predicted by DFT calculations.

         <title>The Copper Chaperone NosL Forms a Heterometal Site for Cu Delivery to Nitrous Oxide Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18810-18814, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper metallochaperone NosL contains a heterobimetallic Zn,Cu site, where the redox&#8208;inert ZnII serves a structural role and prevents oxidation of the cysteine ligands. It also pre&#8208;forms the binding site for the cargo of the chaperone, a single CuI ion that is eventually transferred to the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase in the process of assembling its copper centres, CuA and CuZ.







Abstract
The final step of denitrification is the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2, mediated by Cu&#8208;dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR). Its metal centers, CuA and CuZ, are assembled through sequential provision of twelve CuI ions by a metallochaperone that forms part of a nos gene cluster encoding the enzyme and its accessory factors. The chaperone is the nosL gene product, an 18&#8197;kDa lipoprotein predicted to reside in the outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In order to better understand the assembly of N2OR, we have produced NosL from Shewanella denitrificans and determined the structure of the metal&#8208;loaded chaperone by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protein assembled a heterodinuclear metal site consisting of ZnII and CuI, as evidenced by anomalous X&#8208;ray scattering. While only CuI is delivered to the enzyme, the stabilizing presence of ZnII is essential for the functionality and structural integrity of the chaperone.

Light&#8208;induced molecular plumbing of cyclic peptide nanotubes based on a [4+4] cycloaddition of anthracene moieties is described. The geometrical changes induced by the formation of the cycloadduct transfer to the supramolecular aggregate structural constrains that force the nanotube to bend.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced molecular piping of cyclic peptide nanotubes to form bent tubular structures is described. The process is based on the [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene moieties, whose structural changes derived from the interdigitated flat disposition of precursors to the corresponding cycloadduct moieties, induced the geometrical modifications in nanotubes packing that provokes their curvature. For this purpose, we designed a new class of cyclic peptide nanotubes formed by &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The presence of the former predisposes the peptide to stack in a parallel fashion with the &#946;&#8208;residues aligned along the nanotube and the homogeneous distribution of anthracene pendants.

         <title>Ambient Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Alkenes Using a Nanostructured Ni&#8208;Core&#8211;Shell Catalyst</title>

Hydrogenation and deuteration of olefins made easy: A core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;nanocatalyst (Ni&#8201;NPs@C) allows the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of alkenes under ambient conditions (1&#8197;bar H2/D2, room temperature).







Abstract
A general protocol for the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of a variety of alkenes is presented. Key to success for these reactions is the use of a specific nickel&#8208;graphitic shell&#8208;based core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured catalyst, which is conveniently prepared by impregnation and subsequent calcination of nickel nitrate on carbon at 450&#8201;&#176;C under argon. Applying this nanostructured catalyst, both terminal and internal alkenes, which are of industrial and commercial importance, were selectively hydrogenated and deuterated at ambient conditions (room temperature, using 1&#8197;bar hydrogen or 1&#8197;bar deuterium), giving access to the corresponding alkanes and deuterium&#8208;labeled alkanes in good to excellent yields. The synthetic utility and practicability of this Ni&#8208;based hydrogenation protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reactions as well as efficient catalyst recycling experiments.

         <title>Robust Pseudocapacitive Sodium Cation Intercalation Induced by Cobalt Vacancies at Atomically Thin Co1&#8722;xSe2/Graphene Heterostructure for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18830-18837, August 16, 2021. </description>

The Co vacancies (VCo) at the interface of Co1&#8722;xSe2/graphene (GE) afford strong adsorption of Na+ and a low Na+ diffusion energy barrier to facilitate rapid intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ ions giving remarkable pseudocapacitance. The as&#8208;prepared Co1&#8722;xSe2/GE&#8208;based sodium ion batteries deliver high specific/rate capacity performance and exceptional cycling performance.







Abstract
Electronic structure engineering on electrode materials could bring in a new mechanism to achieve high energy and high power densities in sodium ion batteries. Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe2/graphene heterostructure and obtain Co1&#8722;xSe2/graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na+ adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na+ diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C, excellent rate capability of 576.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8201;C and ultra&#8208;long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na+ storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na+ intercalation for high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate energy storage.

         <title>Photo Click Reaction of Acylsilanes with Indoles</title>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photoreaction occurs under mild conditions mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals. The potential of the method is documented by the successful coupling of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids and by the conjugation of polymers.







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photo click reaction occurs under mild conditions (415&#8197;nm) mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals via light mediated siloxycarbene generation with subsequent indole&#8208;N&#8208;H insertion. We show that this very efficient and fully atom economic coupling process can be applied to conjugate complex systems, as documented by the clicking of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of polymer chains. The linking acetal moiety can be readily cleaved and it is also shown that wavelength&#8208;selective coupling and cleavage with acyl silanes bearing a second photoactive moiety is possible. This is documented by a successful polymerization/depolymerization sequence and by a polymer folding/unfolding process.

         <title>Selective 13C&#8208;Labels on Repeating Glycan Oligomers to Reveal Protein Binding Epitopes through NMR: Polylactosamine Binding to Galectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18777-18782, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Repeating carbohydrate patterns are commonly found in Nature in extended oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. When recognized by protein receptors, dissecting the contribution of each repeating unit to the binding event is not easy. Here, the introduction of 13C&#8208;labels at specific positions of a tri&#8208;LacNAc repeating hexasaccharide has been used in STD&#8208;HSQC&#8197;NMR experiments to reveal the preferred binding epitopes for a panel of human galectins.







Abstract
A combined chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis/NMR&#8208;based methodology is presented to identify, in unambiguous manner, the distinctive binding epitope within repeating sugar oligomers when binding to protein receptors. The concept is based on the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labels at specific monosaccharide units, selected within a repeating glycan oligomeric structure. No new chemical tags are added, and thus the chemical entity remains the same, while the presence of the 13C&#8208;labeled monosaccharide breaks the NMR chemical shift degeneracy that occurs in the non&#8208;labeled compound and allows the unique identification of the different components of the oligomer. The approach is demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study dealing with the interaction of a polylactosamine hexasaccharide with five different galectins that display distinct preferences for these entities.

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18728-18733, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aminocatalytic oxidative umpolung strategy for asymmetric etherification of the &#945;&#8208;position of branched aldehydes is presented. The protocol avoids pre&#8208;functionalization and employs commercially available oxygen nucleophiles. Polarity inversion proceeds via an aminocatalytic SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution of in situ generated racemic quinone adducts.







Abstract
Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogues, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified p&#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners. p&#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91&#8201;% ee, following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95&#8201;% ee. Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports a mechanism proceeding via an SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;&#8208;position of aldehydes.

         <title>Multienzyme One&#8208;Pot Cascades Incorporating Methyltransferases for the Strategic Diversification of Tetrahydroisoquinoline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18673-18679, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions were developed leading to the scalable synthesis of methylated tetra&#8208;hydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The reactions occurred in one&#8208;pot starting from simple building blocks such as dopamine or L&#8208;tyrosine. The use of selected methyltransferases enabled regioselective methylations. When more than one catechol moiety was present, methylations could be directed towards one or more hydroxyl group.







Abstract
The tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) ring system is present in a large variety of structurally diverse natural products exhibiting a wide range of biological activities. Routes to mimic the biosynthetic pathways to such alkaloids, by building cascade reactions in vitro, represents a successful strategy and can offer better stereoselectivities than traditional synthetic methods. S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are crucial in the biosynthesis and diversification of THIQs; however, their application is often limited in vitro by the high cost of SAM and low substrate scope. In this study, we describe the use of methyltransferases in vitro in multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, including for the generation of SAM in situ. Up to seven enzymes were used for the regioselective diversification of natural and non&#8208;natural THIQs on an enzymatic preparative scale. Regioselectivites of the methyltransferases were dependent on the group at C&#8208;1 and presence of fluorine in the THIQs. An interesting dual activity was also discovered for the catechol methyltransferases used, which were found to be able to regioselectively methylate two different catechols in a single molecule.

         <title>Successive Storage of Cations and Anions by Ligands of &#960;&#8211;d&#8208;Conjugated Coordination Polymers Enabling Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18769-18776, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive storage of cations and anions was achieved by redox of only ligands, enabling robust sodium&#8208;ion batteries that show a much higher cyclability than in cases of storage of only cations by redox reactions of both ligands and metal ions.







Abstract
The oxidation of &#960;&#8211;d&#8208;conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) accompanied with anion insertion has the merits of increasing the capacity and elevating the discharge voltages. However, previous reports on this mechanism either required more investigations or showed low capacity and poor cyclablity. Herein, triphenylene&#8208;catecholate&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional CCPs are constructed by employing inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+) as nodes, forming Zn&#8208;HHTP. Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate the successive storage of cations and anions by redox reactions of only ligands, leading to a high reversible capacity of &#8776;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 90&#8201;% after 1000 cycles. On the contrary, as a control experiment, the analogous CCPs (Cu&#8208;HHTP) with Cu2+ nodes, where both ligands and metal ions undergo redox reactions, accompanied by the storage of only Na+ cations, show a much poorer cyclability. These results highlight the importance of redox reactions of only ligands for long&#8208;term cycle life and the insight into the storage mechanisms deepens our understanding on CCPs for the further design of CCPs with high performance.

         <title>An Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskitoid with Zwitterion Cysteamine Linker and its Crystal&#8211;Crystal Transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18750-18760, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique organic&#8211;inorganic single&#8208;crystal perovskitoid structure (yellow) is synthesized by using zwitterionic cysteamine linkers. It gradually transforms into a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper structure (red crystallites) via a crystal&#8211;crystal transformation. The perovskitoid can be used as an active layer in self&#8208;powered photodetector and as a selective Ni2+ ion detection probe.







Abstract
We demonstrate synthesis of a new low&#8208;D hybrid perovskitoid (a perovskite&#8208;like hybrid halide structure, yellow crystals, P21/n space group) using zwitterion cysteamine (2&#8208;aminoethanethiol) linker, and its remarkable molecular diffusion&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase (Red crystals, Pnma space group). Our stable intermediate perovskitoid distinctly differs from all previous reports by way of a unique staggered arrangement of holes in the puckered 2D configuration with a face&#8208;sharing connection between the corrugated&#8208;1D double chains. The PL intensity for the yellow phase is 5 orders higher as compared to the red phase and the corresponding average lifetime is also fairly long (143&#8197;ns). First principles DFT calculations conform very well with the experimental band gap data. We demonstrate applicability of the new perovskitoid yellow phase as an excellent active layer in a self&#8208;powered photodetector and for selective detection of Ni2+ via On&#8208;Off&#8208;On photoluminescence (PL) based on its composite with few&#8208;layer black phosphorous.

         <title>RuV&#8208;Acylimido Intermediate in [RuIV(Por)Cl2]&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;N Bond Formation: Spectroscopic Characterization, Reactivity, and Catalytic Reactions</title>

Experimental studies including ESI&#8208;MS, EPR spectroscopy and KIE, and also DFT calculations point to the intermediacy of a porphyrin&#8208;supported RuV(NCOR) species in [RuIV(Por)Cl2]&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions with acyl azides N3COR (up to 99&#8201;% yield). The [RuIV(Por)Cl2]/N3COR catalytic method is applicable to various substrates, including alkenes, indoles, silyl enol ethers, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions via acylnitrene transfer have recently attracted much attention, but direct detection of the proposed acylnitrenoid/acylimido M(NCOR) (R=aryl or alkyl) species in these reactions poses a formidable challenge. Herein, we report on Ru(NCOR) intermediates in C&#8722;N bond formation catalyzed by [RuIV(Por)Cl2]/N3COR, a catalytic method applicable to aziridine/oxazoline formation from alkenes, amination of substituted indoles, &#945;&#8208;amino ketone formation from silyl enol ethers, amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and functionalization of natural products and carbohydrate derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Experimental studies, including HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EPR measurements, coupled with DFT calculations, lend evidence for the formulation of the Ru(NCOR) acylnitrenoids as a RuV&#8208;imido species.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers with Dual Active Sites for Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18876-18881, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of water dissociation active sites in conjugated acetylenic polymers leads to highly efficient dual active site photocathodes. In poly&#8208; (diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) on Cu foam, the photoactivated C&#946;(H) split the water molecule, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; are responsible for the hydrogen evolution, reaching a benchmark photocurrent density of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE at pH&#8197;13.







Abstract
Although being attractive materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER) under neutral or acidic conditions, conjugated polymers still show poor PEC HER performance in alkaline medium due to the lack of water dissociation sites. Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET) to poly(2,6&#8208;diethynylbenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (pBDT) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) (pDTT) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, pDTT and pBDT, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 120&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE; pH&#8197;13), which are 4.2 and 3&#8197;times higher than that of pDET, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron&#8208;enriched C&#946; of the outer thiophene rings of pDTT are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.

Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (&lt;b&gt;pDET&lt;/b&gt;) to poly(2,6-diethynylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&#8242;]dithiophene (&lt;b&gt;pBDT&lt;/b&gt;) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2-b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-d]thiophene) (&lt;b&gt;pDTT&lt;/b&gt;) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, &lt;b&gt;pDTT&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;pBDT&lt;/b&gt;, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 120&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE; pH&#8197;13), which are 4.2 and 3&#8197;times higher than that of &lt;b&gt;pDET&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron-enriched C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; of the outer thiophene rings of &lt;b&gt;pDTT&lt;/b&gt; are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enzyme Mimic Facilitated Artificial Cell to Mammalian Cell Signal Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18704-18711, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Signal transfer from artificial cells to mammalian cells facilitated by artificial enzymes was demonstrated. Two metalloporphyrins were used to mimic the catalytic behavior of enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family. Hydrogel&#8208;based artificial cells containing these artificial enzymes were able to produce two fluorescent signaling molecules that could diffuse to mammalian HepG2 cells and led to distinguishable intracellular fluorescence.







Abstract
Catalyzing biochemical reactions with enzymes and communicating with neighboring cells via chemical signaling are two fundamental cellular features that play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of organisms. Herein, we present an artificial enzyme (AE) facilitated signal transfer between artificial cells (ACs) and mammalian HepG2 cells. We synthesize metalloporphyrins (MPs) based AEs that mimic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) to catalyze a dealkylation and a hydroxylation reaction, exemplified by the conversion of resorufin ethyl ether (REE) to resorufin and coumarin (COU) to 7&#8208;hydroxycoumarin (7&#8208;HC), respectively. The AEs are immobilized in hydrogels to produce ACs that generate the two diffusive fluorophores, which can diffuse into HepG2 cells and result in dual intracellular emissions. This work highlights the use of AEs to promote AC to mammalian signal transfer, which opens up new opportunities for integrating the synthetic and living world with a bottom&#8208;up strategy.

Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8722;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We present herein an unprecedented diastereoconvergent synthesis of vicinal diamines from diols through an economical, redox&#8208;neutral process. Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8722;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, the first enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.

         <title>Stability and Optical Absorption of a Comprehensive Virtual Library of Minimal Eumelanin Oligomer Models**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18800-18809, August 16, 2021. </description>

To understand the details of eumelanin structure and relate the stability of its components with optical properties, we have studied a library of 830 minimal models of eumelanin components, dimers of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxy indole (DHI), with density functional theory. Our library considers all possible chemical diversity. The most stable dimers have polycyclic, oxidized structures and absorb as low as 1.3&#8197;eV (&#955;&gt;900&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Eumelanin is responsible for photoprotection in living organisms. It is made of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) oligomers. However, lack of detailed structural knowledge limits understanding its function and exploiting its potential in material science. To uncover the relationship between structural stability and optical properties, we have studied a virtual library of 830 DHI dimers. We find a preference for oxidized, polycyclic structures which speaks in favor of graphite&#8208;like structures for the larger oligomers, and propose an electrocyclic formation mechanism. Besides widely considered quinone oxidation patterns, also structures with interfragment double bonds and zwitterionic resonance structures are stable. Future theoretical melanine models will have to cover this diversity, and we introduce a new representative set of 49 stable dimers. Some stable oxidized dimers have absorption energies as low as 1.3&#8197;eV. They may be present as substructures in the naturally found oligomers and contribute to the absorption spectrum of the biopolymer.

         <title>Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries enabled by Zincophilic&#8211;Zincophobic Interfacial Layers and Interrupted Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18845-18851, August 16, 2021. </description>

A highly reversible Zn anode working at low temperature is achieved by introducing SnCl2 into eutectic ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte to form a zincophilic&#8211;zincophobic interfacial layer on the Zn anode in&#8197;situ. The bottom layer of Sn facilitates uniform Zn deposition, while the top layer of zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2 H2O facilitates Zn2+ diffusion and avoids Zn dendrites. The eutectic composition enhances the low temperature conductivity.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries promise high energy density but suffer from Zn dendritic growth and poor low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we overcome both challenges by using an eutectic 7.6&#8197;m ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte with 0.05&#8197;m SnCl2 additive, which in situ forms a zincophilic/zincophobic Sn/Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O bilayer interphase and enables low temperature operation. Zincophilic Sn decreases Zn plating/stripping overpotential and promotes uniform Zn plating, while zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O top&#8208;layer suppresses Zn dendrite growth. The eutectic electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity of &#8776;0.8&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C due to the distortion of hydrogen bond network by solvated Zn2+ and Cl&#8722;. The eutectic electrolyte enables Zn&#8741;Ti half&#8208;cell a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of &gt;99.7&#8201;% for 200 cycles and Zn&#8741;Zn cell steady charge/discharge for 500&#8197;h with a low overpotential of 8&#8197;mV at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Practically, Zn&#8741;VOPO4 batteries maintain &gt;95&#8201;% capacity with a CE of &gt;99.9&#8201;% for 200 cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, and retain &#8776;30&#8201;% capacity at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C of that at 20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Dry Reforming of CH4/CO2 by Stable Ni Nanocrystals on Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline MgO Monoliths at Reduced Temperature</title>

Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles on porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths to enhance dry reforming of CH4/CO2 and present the quantitative syngas production with excellent durability after continuous operation of 500 hours at 650&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large&#8208;scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH4/CO2. We show the complete conversion of CH4/CO2 even only at 700&#8201;&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500&#8197;hours. The well&#8208;defined and catalytically active Ni&#8208;MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance. Our findings would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the &#8220;Nanocrystal On Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Monoliths&#8221; technique could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.

         <title>Macrodiolide Diversification Reveals Broad Immunosuppressive Activity That Impairs the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18734-18741, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and flexible synthesis of macrodiolides related to the natural product vermiculine is described. A common building block prepared through a catalytic asymmetric route enabled various modifications to the scaffold and stereochemical flexibility. Partial blocking of the keto&#8208;enoate groups afforded the analogue LH519 (see structure), which exhibited broad inhibition of innate immune signaling pathways, including cGAS&#8208;STING, with minimal effects on cell viability.







Abstract
The development of new immunomodulatory agents can impact various areas of medicine. In particular, compounds with the ability to modulate innate immunological pathways hold significant unexplored potential. Herein, we report a modular synthetic approach to the macrodiolide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;vermiculine, an agent previously shown to possess diverse biological effects, including cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity. The synthesis allows for a high degree of flexibility in modifying the macrocyclic framework, including the formation of all possible stereoisomers. In total, 18 analogues were prepared. Two analogues with minor structural modifications showed clearly enhanced cancer cell line selectivity and reduced toxicity. Moreover, these compounds possessed broad inhibitory activity against innate immunological pathways in human PBMCs, including the DNA&#8208;sensing cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Initial mechanistic characterization suggests a surprising impairment of the STING&#8208;TBK1 interaction.

         <title>Sydnone Methides&#8212;A Forgotten Class of Mesoionic Compounds for the Generation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18882-18887, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Except for a single example, sydnone methides have been unknown to date. Syntheses are described here, leading to 10 stable and intensely colorful, slightly fluorescent sydnone methides with Z=CN, COOMe, and SO2Me, respectively. On deprotonation, unique anionic &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are formed which react to thioethers and selenoethers, mercury, gold and rhodium complexes, and 4&#8208;acylsydnone methide on treatment with acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Sydnone methides are described from which only one single example has been mentioned in the literature so far. Their deprotonation gave anions which can be formulated as &#960;&#8208;electron rich anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Sulfur and selenium adducts were stabilized as their methyl ethers, and mercury, gold as well as rhodium complexes of the sydnone methide carbenes were prepared. Sydnone methide anions also undergo C&#8722;C coupling reactions with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;iodobenzene under Pd(PPh3)4 and CuBr catalysis. 77Se&#8197;NMR resonance frequencies and 1JC4&#8208;Se as well as 1JC4&#8208;H coupling constants have been determined to gain knowledge about the electronic properties of the anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. The carbene carbon atom of the sydnone methide anion 3&#8201;j resonates at &#948;=155.2&#8197;ppm in 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C which is extremely shifted upfield in comparison to classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes.

         <title>Consecutive Ligand&#8208;Based Electron Transfer in New Molecular Copper&#8208;Based Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A family of Cu&#8208;based complexes bearing dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The new complexes are capable of performing water oxidation catalysis at overpotentials between 557&#8211;830&#8197;mV pH&#8197;11.6. A detailed electrocatalytic study in combination with computational calculations revealed the all ligand&#8208;based nature of the electron transfer processes involved in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Water oxidation to dioxygen is one of the key reactions that need to be mastered for the design of practical devices based on water splitting with sunlight. In this context, water oxidation catalysts based on first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are highly desirable due to their low cost and their synthetic versatility and tunability through rational ligand design. A new family of dianionic bpy&#8208;amidate ligands of general formula H2LNn&#8722; (LN is [2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxamide) substituted with phenyl or naphthyl redox non&#8208;innocent moieties is described. A detailed electrochemical analysis of [(L4)Cu]2&#8722; (L4=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarbonyl)bis(azanediyl))dibenzenesulfonate) at pH&#8197;11.6 shows the presence of a large electrocatalytic wave for water oxidation catalysis at an &#951;=830&#8197;mV. Combined experimental and computational evidence, support an all ligand&#8208;based process with redox events taking place at the aryl&#8208;amide groups and at the hydroxido ligands.

The mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers with ultrasonication (solution state) and ball&#8208;mill grinding (solid state) was explored. This study provides important insight into the influence of polymer architecture on mechanochemical reactions and the difference in reactivity that is observed in solution and solid states, which has important implications in the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.







Abstract
We explored the mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers in solution (with ultrasonication, US) and solid states (with ball&#8208;mill grinding, BMG). Over 50 polymers were prepared with varying backbone length and arm architecture, composition, and size. With US, we found that bottlebrush and dendronized polymers exhibited consistent backbone scission behavior, which was related to their elongated conformations in solution. Considerably different behavior was observed with BMG, as arm architecture and composition had a significant impact on backbone scission rates. Arm scission was also observed for bottlebrush polymers in both solution and solid states, but only in the solid state for dendronized polymers. Motivated by these results, multi&#8208;mechanophore polymers with bottlebrush and dendronized polymer architectures were prepared and their reactivity was compared. Although dendronized polymers showed slower arm&#8208;scission, the selectivity for mechanophore activation was much higher. Overall, these results have important implications to the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Modified Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films for Polarity&#8208;Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>

Surface&#8208;modification of phthalocyanine&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) films by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains is developed for achieving high&#8208;performance polarity&#8208;selective chemiresistive sensing toward humidity and polar alcohols.







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as electroactive materials for chemiresistive sensors, but selective sensing with fast response/recovery is a challenge. Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni2[MPc(NH)8] 2D c&#8208;MOF films are presented as active layers for polarity&#8208;selective chemiresisitors toward water and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Surface&#8208;hydrophobic modification by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains on 2D c&#8208;MOF films decreases diffused analytes into the MOF backbone, resulting in a considerably accelerated recovery progress (from ca. 50 to ca. 10&#8197;s) during humidity sensing. Toward VOCs, the sensors deliver a polarity&#8208;selective response among alcohols but no signal for low&#8208;polarity aprotic hydrocarbons. The octadecyltrimethoxysilane&#8208;modified Ni2[MPc(NH)8] based sensor displays high&#8208;performance methanol sensing with fast response (36&#8197;s)/recovery (13&#8197;s) and a detection limit as low as 10&#8197;ppm, surpassing reported room&#8208;temperature chemiresistors.

Compartmentalised flow reactors allow biocatalytic cascades that would be impossible using standard methods, as described by Sebastian&#8197;C. Cosgrove, Sabine&#8197;L. Flitsch, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;18660. Carbonyl intermediates were continuously generated via biocatalytic oxidation, then converted into different amine products using immobilised aminating enzymes. The use of flow equipment allowed exquisite control of the paths and enabled a range of new biocatalytic cascades to be constructed, paving the way for fully automated continuous biocatalytic cascades.

         <title>Hematite Photoanodes for Water Oxidation: Electronic Transitions, Carrier Dynamics, and Surface Energetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18380-18396, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current understanding of hematite photoanodes is comprehensively discussed. In light of guidelines for photoanode design, we focus on charge carriers, their origin, early&#8208;stage dynamics, surface dynamics and their competitive interfacial transfer through the valence band edge, surface states, and cocatalysts.







Abstract
We review the current understanding of charge carriers in model hematite photoanodes at different stages. The origin of charge carriers is discussed based on the electronic structure and absorption features, highlighting the controversial assignment of the electronic transitions near the absorption edge. Next, the dynamic evolution of charge carriers is analyzed both on the ultrafast and on the surface reaction timescales, with special emphasis on the arguable spectroscopic assignment of electrons/holes and their kinetics. Further, the competitive charge transfer centers at the solid&#8211;liquid interface are reviewed, and the chemical nature of relevant surface states is updated. Finally, an overview on the function of widely employed surface cocatalysts is given to illustrate the complex influence of physiochemical modifications on the charge carrier dynamics. The understanding of charge carriers from their origin all the way to their interfacial transfer is vital for the future of photoanode design.

New chemistry from single cells: The challenge of studying uncultivated microbes is a significant impediment to efforts to mine the natural world for useful molecules. Single&#8208;cell analysis techniques have achieved significant success in the study of microbial ecology but are only beginning to gain traction in the search for microbial natural products. This review highlights successful implementations and promising techniques for future studies.







Abstract
The diverse microbes that produce natural products represent an important source of novel therapeutics, drug leads, and scientific tools. However, the vast majority have not been grown in axenic culture and are members of complex communities. While meta&#8208;&#8217;omic methods such as metagenomics, &#8208;transcriptomics, and &#8208;proteomics reveal collective molecular features of this &#8220;microbial dark matter&#8221;, the study of individual microbiome members can be challenging. To address these limits, a number of techniques with single&#8208;bacterial resolution have been developed in the last decade and a half. While several of these are embraced by microbial ecologists, there has been less use by researchers interested in mining microbes for natural products. In this review, we discuss the available and emerging techniques for targeted single&#8208;cell analysis with a particular focus on applications to the discovery and study of natural products.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Making Strong Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18397-18410, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages and drawbacks of strategies that generate strong graphene materials by eliminating the voids between the graphene platelets and the wrinkling of the graphene platelets are discussed in this Minireview. The fundamental mechanical properties and the wide&#8208;ranging electrical and magnetic properties of the resulting materials are also discussed.







Abstract
Graphene materials have been widely applied in various fields because of their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, two obstacles arise during the assembly of graphene platelets into macroscale graphene materials and composites that impair the performance of the resultant graphene materials: 1)&#8197;the voids between the graphene platelets, and 2)&#8197;the wrinkling of the graphene platelets. In the past decade, several strategies have been developed to eliminate these obstacles. These strategies result in strong macroscale graphene materials, such as graphene fibers with tensile strengths of over 3.4&#8197;GPa and sheets with tensile strengths of over 1.5&#8197;GPa, which have many practical applications. This Minireview summarizes the effective strategies for assembling graphene materials and compares their advantages and drawbacks. The preparation processes as well as the resulting fundamental mechanical properties and wide spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties are also discussed.

     alt="Chemical Strategies for Making Strong Graphene Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages and drawbacks of strategies that generate strong graphene materials by eliminating the voids between the graphene platelets and the wrinkling of the graphene platelets are discussed in this Minireview. The fundamental mechanical properties and the wide-ranging electrical and magnetic properties of the resulting materials are also discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene materials have been widely applied in various fields because of their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, two obstacles arise during the assembly of graphene platelets into macroscale graphene materials and composites that impair the performance of the resultant graphene materials: 1)&#8197;the voids between the graphene platelets, and 2)&#8197;the wrinkling of the graphene platelets. In the past decade, several strategies have been developed to eliminate these obstacles. These strategies result in strong macroscale graphene materials, such as graphene fibers with tensile strengths of over 3.4&#8197;GPa and sheets with tensile strengths of over 1.5&#8197;GPa, which have many practical applications. This Minireview summarizes the effective strategies for assembling graphene materials and compares their advantages and drawbacks. The preparation processes as well as the resulting fundamental mechanical properties and wide spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties are also discussed. Finally, our outlook for the future of this field is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Loading Linear Arrays of CuII Inside Aromatic Amide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18461-18466, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very stable helices of oligoamides take up CuII ions in their cavity through deprotonation with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of up to 16 CuII centers, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath.







Abstract
The very stable helices of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid oligoamides are shown to uptake CuII ions in their cavity through deprotonation of their amide functions with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of a defined number of CuII centers (up to sixteen in this study) at a 3&#8197;&#197; distance, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath. The helices pack in the solid state so that the arrays of CuII extend intermolecularly. Conductive&#8208;AFM and cyclic voltammetry suggest that electrons are transported throughout the metal&#8208;loaded helices in contrast with hole transport observed for analogous foldamers devoid of metal ions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Amidation of Light Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18467-18471, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenative amidation of light alkanes C1&#8211;C4 has been accomplished using copper catalysis. This strategy has allowed establishing the relative reactivity of the C&#8722;H bonds of gaseous alkanes, which correlates with bond dissociation energy values.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in light alkanes, particularly to form C&#8722;N bonds, remains a challenge. We report the dehydrogenative coupling of amides with C1&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons to form N&#8208;alkyl amide products with tBuOOtBu as oxidant, and a copper complex of a phenanthroline&#8208;type ligand as catalyst. The reactions occurred in good yields in benzene or supercritical carbon dioxide as solvents. This strategy allowed for the determination of the relative reactivity of these alkane C&#8722;H bonds toward this amination process and showed, in contrast to prior work with larger alkanes, that the reactivity correlated with bond dissociation energies.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Embedded Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Redox Chemistry of Cyclothianthrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18443-18447, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, [n]cyclothianthrenes, were successfully constructed and characterized. The reported synthetic strategy allows access to not only the smallest and most strained cyclothianthrene, but also unprecedented chiral belts including a M&#246;bius strip. Further studies reveal these belt&#8208;like molecules are redox&#8208;active and potential materials for host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclothianthrenes, a series of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts proposed a decade ago, were successfully constructed through a stepwise bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The belt [6]cyclothianthrene ([6]CT) is the smallest and most strained member of the family yet reported. Both [6]CT and [8]CT are the first examples of cyclothianthrene characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. An unprecedented chiral belt [7]CT and a M&#246;bius&#8208;shaped [9]CT were also achieved via modular synthesis. Crystallographic and computational studies show that belts [6]CT&#8208;[8]CT have prism&#8208;like conformations with well&#8208;defined tubular cavities which have potential for guest molecule inclusion. Cyclic voltammograms further revealed that these belts are redox&#8208;active. The success of constructing sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, that is, cyclothianthrenes, greatly enriches the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped molecular belts and tubes.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Organic Fluid Phosphorescence Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18557-18560, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and effective strategy for the preparation of pure organic fluid materials with effective room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission was proposed. The material was observed to have moderate phosphorescent emission even at 85&#8201;&#176;C, based on which a temperature detection strategy was developed.







Abstract
It is an accepted approach to construct room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials by suppressing the non&#8208;radiative decay process. However, there is limited success in developing fluid phosphorescence materials owing to the ultrafast non&#8208;radiation relaxation of vibration and collision of molecules in fluid matrixes. Here, a universal deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent strategy is proposed for developing pure organic phosphorescent fluid materials that are able to generate effective phosphorescent emissions at both room temperature (&#934;RTP,293&#8201;K&#8776;30&#8201;%) and even higher temperature (&#934;RTP,358&#8201;K&#8776;4.53&#8201;%). Based on these findings, a qualitative analytical method was developed for leak detection and a quantitative analytical technique was further validated to help visually identify the heat distribution of irregular surfaces. This advancement empowers the current organic phosphorescent system offering an alternative to determine moisture and heat from non&#8208;invasive photoluminescence emission colors.

         <title>Five Step Total Synthesis of Lythranidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18561-18565, August 16, 2021. </description>

Design and implementation of a symmetry&#8208;focused, two&#8208;directional strategy leads to an extraordinarily short synthesis of the macrocyclic metacyclophane natural product lythranidine and most of its diastereomers.







Abstract
A concise synthesis of the alkaloid lythranidine is reported. The strategy exploits the target's local C2 symmetry by adopting a two directional synthetic approach, first in an acyclic environment, then in a cyclic system and finally in a bridged macrocyclic domain. The latter phase of the synthesis, which installs all four stereocenters, involves a thermodynamically controlled, twofold intermolecular/transannular aza&#8208;Michael addition and a twofold hydride reduction. The synthesis is one third of the length of the most step&#8208;economic previous approach, providing access to gram quantities of the natural product. The broad&#8208;spectrum nature of the synthesis is demonstrated through the preparation of three diastereomeric analogues of the natural product.

&lt;p&gt;A concise synthesis of the alkaloid lythranidine is reported. The strategy exploits the target's local C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry by adopting a two directional synthetic approach, first in an acyclic environment, then in a cyclic system and finally in a bridged macrocyclic domain. The latter phase of the synthesis, which installs all four stereocenters, involves a thermodynamically controlled, twofold intermolecular/transannular aza-Michael addition and a twofold hydride reduction. The synthesis is one third of the length of the most step-economic previous approach, providing access to gram quantities of the natural product. The broad-spectrum nature of the synthesis is demonstrated through the preparation of three diastereomeric analogues of the natural product.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Water Oxidation under Modal Ultrastrong Coupling Conditions Using Gold/Silver Alloy Nanoparticles and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Nanocavities</title>

         <dc:description>
We fabricated a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles, a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal ultrastrong coupling conditions and applied the photoanode to a water oxidation reaction. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% of maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency, obtained at 580&#8197;nm. These results derive from the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency owing to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement.







Abstract
We developed a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs), a TiO2 thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal strong coupling conditions with a large splitting energy of 520&#8197;meV, which can be categorized into the ultrastrong coupling regime. We fabricated a photoanode under ultrastrong coupling conditions to verify the relationship between the coupling strength and photoelectric conversion efficiency and successfully performed efficient photochemical reactions. The AATA photoanode showed a 4.0&#8201;% maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE), obtained at 580&#8197;nm, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was 4.1&#8201;%. These results were attributed to the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency due to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement and relatively negative potential distribution of the hot electrons. Furthermore, hybrid mode&#8208;induced water oxidation using AATA structures was performed, with a Faraday efficiency of more than 70&#8201;% for O2 evolution.

         <title>Cycloisomerization of Carbamoyl Chlorides in Hexafluoroisopropanol: Stereoselective Synthesis of Chlorinated Methylene Oxindoles and Quinolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18478-18483, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a reagent in the cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides is demonstrated. The chlorinated methylene oxindole products are obtained in excellent E&#8208;selectivities. This reactivity was also extended towards the synthesis of chlorinated methylene pyrrolidones and 2&#8208;quinolinones.







Abstract
Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was employed as an additive for the generation of 3&#8208;(chloromethylene)oxindoles via the chloroacylation of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides. This reaction avoids the use of a metal catalyst and accesses products in high yields and stereoselectivities. Additionally, this reaction is scalable and proved amenable to a series of product derivatizations, including the synthesis of nintedanib. The reactivity of alkene&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was harnessed towards the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones.

Microreactor on the fly: A special microreactor that permits mass spectrometric probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was demonstrated based on collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets, which employed a theta&#8208;glass capillary integrated with carbon bipolar electrodes to produce short&#8208;lived intermediates in situ.







Abstract
A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta&#8208;glass capillary. The two individual microchannels of the theta&#8208;glass capillary are asymmetrically or symmetrically fabricated with a carbon bipolar electrode to produce intermediates in situ. Microdroplets containing the newly formed intermediates collide with those of the invoked reactants at sub&#8208;10 microsecond level, making it a powerful tool for exploring their ultrafast initial transformations. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the identification of the key radical cation intermediate in the oxidative dimerization of 8&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and also the first disclosure of previously hidden nitrenium ion involved reaction pathway in the C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling between N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylaniline and phenothiazine.

         <title>Palladium/TY&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intermolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Aldehydes with Aryl Bromides</title>

Asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl disubstituted aldehydes with aryl bromides provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with 50:50&#8211;97:3 er. Enantiomers were obtained efficiently with the same ligand by changing the functional groups of aryl bromides with aldehydes.







Abstract
Despite much progress has been made in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation reactions of cyclic ketones, lactones and lactams, the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic carbonyl compounds lagged much behind due to the in situ generated Z/E&#8208;enolate intermediates leading to opposite enantiomers. Especially, the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of acyclic aldehydes is a long&#8208;standing challenge, because of the highest activity among carbonyl compounds leading to various competitive side reactions. Herein we reported an efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl disubstituted aldehydes with aryl bromides, which provides a rapid access to chiral aldehydes bearing an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in moderate to good yields with good er in most cases. In addition, a pair of enantiomers could be easily prepared with the use of the same ligand by exchanging the aryl groups of aldehyde and aryl bromide.

         <title>Transfer, Amplification, Storage, and Complete Self&#8208;Recovery of Supramolecular Chirality in an Achiral Polymer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18566-18571, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage and complete self&#8208;recovery of supramolecular chirality in an absolute achiral azobenzene&#8208;containing polymer system is successfully achieved for the first time.







Abstract
Supramolecular chirality and its complete self&#8208;recovery ability are highly mystical in nature and biological systems, which remains a major challenge today. Herein, we demonstrate that partially cross&#8208;linked azobenzene (Azo) units can be employed as the potential chiral trigger to fully heal the destroyed helical superstructure in achiral nematic polymer system. Combining the self&#8208;assembly of Azo units and terminal hydroxyl groups in polymer side chains allows the vapor&#8208;induced chiral nematic phase and covalent fixation of the superstructure via acetal reaction. The induced helical structure of Azo units can be stored by inter&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking, even after removal of the chiral source. Most interestingly, the stored chiral information can trigger perfect chiral self&#8208;recovery (CSR) behavior after being destroyed by UV light, heat, and solvents. The results pave a new way for producing novel chiroptical materials with reversible chirality from achiral sources.

     alt="Transfer, Amplification, Storage, and Complete Self-Recovery of Supramolecular Chirality in an Achiral Polymer System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage and complete self-recovery of supramolecular chirality in an absolute achiral azobenzene-containing polymer system is successfully achieved for the first time.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular chirality and its complete self-recovery ability are highly mystical in nature and biological systems, which remains a major challenge today. Herein, we demonstrate that partially cross-linked azobenzene (Azo) units can be employed as the potential chiral trigger to fully heal the destroyed helical superstructure in achiral nematic polymer system. Combining the self-assembly of Azo units and terminal hydroxyl groups in polymer side chains allows the vapor-induced chiral nematic phase and covalent fixation of the superstructure via acetal reaction. The induced helical structure of Azo units can be stored by inter-chain cross-linking, even after removal of the chiral source. Most interestingly, the stored chiral information can trigger perfect chiral self-recovery (CSR) behavior after being destroyed by UV light, heat, and solvents. The results pave a new way for producing novel chiroptical materials with reversible chirality from achiral sources.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Metathesis&#8208;Based Approach to the Synthesis of the Anti&#8208;Malarial Macrodiolide Samroiyotmycin&#8197;A</title>

Forging of the 20&#8208;membered macrocylic core of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A can be readily achieved by combining a Mo&#8208;catalysed one&#8208;pot alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis ring&#8208;closing metathesis of bisalkyne building blocks and Ru&#8208;catalysed hydrometallation chemistry. These key transformations have enabled the first total synthesis of this anti&#8208;malarial C2&#8208;symmetric macrodiolide.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of samroiyotmycin&#8197;A (1), a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered anti&#8208;malarial macrodiolide isolated from Streptomyces sp. The convergent synthetic strategy orchestrates bisalkyne fragment&#8208;assembly using an unprecedented Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type condensation on a substituted &#946;&#8208;lactone and an ambitious late&#8208;stage one&#8208;pot alkyne cross metathesis&#8211;ring&#8208;closing metathesis (ACM&#8211;RCAM) reaction. The demanding alkyne metathesis sequence is achieved using the latest generation of molybdenum alkylidynes endowed with a tripodal silanolate ligand framework. Subsequent conversion to the required E&#8208;alkenes uses contemporary hydrometallation chemistry catalysed by tetrameric cluster [{Cp*RuCl}4].

         <title>Heteroleptic Ligation by an endo&#8208;Functionalized Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18582-18586, August 16, 2021. </description>

A cage compound is synthesized that is endo&#8208;functionalized with one carboxylic acid and two imidazole moieties. These groups can cooperate with each other to coordinate to Zn(II) and Fe(II) resulting in biomimetic quasi&#8208;heteroleptic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cage complexes. Coordination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate to the iron complex leads to an increase of its reactivity towards dioxygen.







Abstract
A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;heteroleptic complexes with properly endo&#8208;functionalized cages as ligands is presented. The cage ligand reported here is of a covalent organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine. Inspired by enzymatic active sites, the described system bears one carboxylate and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the iron(II) complex in solution and the solid state validates the structure and shows that no undesired but commonly observed dimerization process takes place. The solid&#8208;state structure shows a five&#8208;coordinate metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which makes Fe@2 an unprecedentedly detailed structural model complex for this kind of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenases. As, as confirmed by the crystal structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the biologically relevant ligand &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate is implemented. We observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens studies investigating Fe@2 as a functional model complex.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer Synthesis by Merging Photoiniferter and Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations</title>

Well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;b&#8208;polyether block copolymers are achieved in one step by combining photoiniferter polymerization of acrylamides with organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of epoxides. The two polymerization systems are compatible with one another, generating copolymers with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality and endowing selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP.







Abstract
Access to block copolymers from monomers that do not polymerize via a common mechanism requires initiation from a multifunctional species that allows orthogonal polymerization chemistries. We disclose a strategy to provide well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;b&#8208;polyether block copolymers by a one&#8208;pot combination of photoiniferter polymerization and organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using a hydroxy&#8208;functionalized trithiocarbonate photoiniferter as the dual initiator at ambient temperature. Our results reveal good compatibility between the two polymerization systems and highlight that they can be performed in arbitrary order or simultaneously with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality. We also demonstrate selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP. We harnessed the efficiency of combining these polymerization systems to provide tailor&#8208;made block copolymers from chemically distinct monomers.

         <title>Strained and Reactive Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Supported Metallasilanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18489-18493, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported MnI&#8208;metallasilanone was synthesized. This silanone complex is highly strained because of its incorporation in a small cyclic structure formed by the intramolecular silanone&#8208;MnI interaction. Thanks to the high ring strain, the interaction Si=O&#8594;Mn is labile, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity with various small molecules such as H2 or ethylene gas in mild conditions.







Abstract
A novel stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported MnI&#8208;metallasilanone 3 was synthesized. The intramolecular silanone&#8208;MnI interaction induces a highly strained three&#8208;membered cyclic structure, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity of 3 as a donor/acceptor complex of silanone.

&lt;p&gt;A new stable donor/acceptor-supported Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-metallasilanone was synthesized. This silanone complex is highly strained because of its incorporation in a small cyclic structure formed by the intramolecular silanone-Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; interaction. Thanks to the high ring strain, the interaction Si=O&#8594;Mn is labile, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity with various small molecules such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ethylene gas in mild conditions.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Osteopontin Fragment Orders During Interfacial Calcium Oxalate Mineralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18577-18581, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;specific vibrational spectroscopy was applied to study the structure and interaction of central urinary osteopontin peptide at the air&#8211;water interface and during calcium oxalate mineralization. The interfacial peptides show ordered and assembled &#946;&#8208;turn motifs with binding of Ca2+ ions and CaC2O4 minerals, in contrast to the disordered peptide structure in bulk solution.







Abstract
Calcium oxalate (CaC2O4) is the major component of kidney stone. The acidic osteopontin (OPN) protein in human urine can effectively inhibit the growth of CaC2O4 crystals, thereby acting as a potent stone preventer. Previous studies in bulk solution all attest to the importance of binding and recognition of OPN at the CaC2O4 mineral surface, yet molecular level insights into the active interface during CaC2O4 mineralization are still lacking. Here, we probe the structure of the central OPN fragment and its interaction with Ca2+ and CaC2O4 at the water&#8211;air interface using surface&#8208;specific non&#8208;linear vibrational spectroscopy. While OPN peptides remain largely disordered in solution, our results reveal that the bidentate binding of Ca2+ ions refold the interfacial peptides into well&#8208;ordered and assembled &#946;&#8208;turn motifs. One critical intermediate directs mineralization by releasing structural freedom of backbone and binding side chains. These insights into the mineral interface are crucial for understanding the pathological development of kidney stones and possibly relevant for calcium oxalate biomineralization in general.

         <title>Highly Active PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 Nanocomposites Supported on One Dimensional Halloysite Nanotubes for Photoassisted Thermal Catalytic Methane Combustion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18552-18556, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One dimensional halloysite nanotubes supported PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 nanocomposites have good visible light response, which showed excellent performance in photoassisted thermal catalytic CH4 combustion. Its light&#8208;off temperature could be largely reduced to as low as 180&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy inspires us much to design photocatalysts for a variety of thermal catalytic reactions involved by active oxygen species under milder conditions.







Abstract
In this work, we have successfully triggered the aqueous auto&#8208;redox reactions between reductive Ce(OH)3 and oxidative MnO4&#8722;/Pd2+ ions to form PdO/Mn3O4/CeO2 (PMC) nanocomposites. PMC could spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into compact encapsulation on the surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) to form the final one dimensional HNTs supported PMCs (HPMC). It is identified that there exists strong synergistic effects among the components of PdO, Mn3O4, and CeO2, and hence HPMC could show excellent performance on photoassisted thermal catalytic CH4 combustion that its light&#8208;off temperature was sharply reduced to be 180&#8201;&#176;C under visible light irradiation. Based on detailed studies, it is found that the catalytic reaction process well follows the classic MVK mechanism, and adsorption/activation of O2 into active oxygen species (O*) should be the rate&#8208;determining step for CH4 conversion.

         <title>Neutral Unsymmetrical Coordinated Cyclophane Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18472-18477, August 16, 2021. </description>

We demonstrate how a cyclophane structure can be generated in square&#8208;planar complexes with two different chelating donors (N,O). An ancillary second imine function in the versatile &#954;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure between two symmetrical 4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diallyl substituted terphenyl motifs.







Abstract
Cyclophane structures can control steric pressure in the otherwise open spaces of square&#8208;planar d8&#8208;metal catalysts. This elegant concept was so far limited to symmetrical coordinated metals. We report how a cyclophane motif can be generated in ligands that chelate via two different donors. An ancillary second imine in the versatile &#954;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;salicylaldiminato catalyst type enables ring closure via olefin metathesis and selective double bond hydrogenation to yield a 30&#8208;membered ring efficiently. Experimental and theoretical analyses show the ancillary imine is directed away from the active site and inert for catalysis. In ethylene polymerization the cyclophane catalyst is more active and temperature stable vs. an open structure reference, notably also in polar solvents. Increased molecular weights and decreased degrees of branching can be traced to an increased energy of sterically demanding transition states by the encircling cyclophane while chain propagation remains highly efficient.

A diastereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction was developed as an effective pathway to the core tetracyclic skeleton of Cephalotaxus diterpenoids. The construction of the tropone moiety was enabled by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/elimination protocol. Using the strategy, the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid&#8197;F, (+)&#8208;fortalpinoid&#8197;A, and (+)&#8208;cephinoid&#8197;H was accomplished for the first time.







Abstract
3&#8208;Deoxyfortalpinoid&#8197;F, fortalpinoid&#8197;A, and cephinoid&#8197;H are members of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids class of natural products, which feature diverse chemical structures and valuable biological activities. We report herein the development of a diastereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction as an effective pathway to access the core tetracyclic skeleton, which is found widely in Cephalotaxus diterpenoids. Furthermore, we enabled the construction of the tropone moiety through a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/elimination protocol. Based on the developed strategy, asymmetric synthesis of the title compounds has been achieved for the first time.

         <title>KIO4&#8208;mediated Selective Hydroxymethylation/Methylenation of Imidazo&#8208;Heteroarenes: A Greener Approach</title>

An efficient, sustainable and chemoselective procedure for the C(sp2)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation and methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes, using KIO4 has been developed. In the presence of ethylene glycol, hydroxymethylated products were obtained in excellent yields, while the use of glycerol in the reaction resulted in the methylenated products. The reaction allows access to the most advanced intermediate of the drug Zolpidem.







Abstract
Herein, we report a KIO4&#8208;mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one&#8208;pot C(sp2)&#8722;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated in situ via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs, e.g., Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.

         <title>A TiSe2&#8208;Graphite Dual Ion Battery: Fast Na&#8208;Ion Insertion and Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18430-18437, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB with fast kinetics and excellent cycling stability is for the first time proposed by combining a TiSe2 Na&#8208;ion anode with an anion&#8208;storing graphite cathode. Compared with other Na&#8208;DIBs, the TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB significantly improves the Na&#8208;ion insertion kinetics with superior cycle stability. The Na&#8208;ion and PF6&#8722; storage mechanism is investigated.







Abstract
The sodium dual ion battery (Na&#8208;DIB) technology is proposed as highly promising alternative over lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of anode materials seriously impedes their practical implementation. Herein, a Na&#8208;DIB based on TiSe2&#8208;graphite is reported. The high diffusion coefficient of Na&#8208;ions (3.21&#215;10&#8722;11&#8211;1.20&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and the very low Na&#8208;ion diffusion barrier (0.50&#8197;eV) lead to very fast electrode kinetics, alike in conventional surface capacitive storage systems. In&#8208;situ investigations reveal that the fast Na&#8208;ion diffusion involves four insertion stage compositions. A prototype cell shows a reversible capacity of 81.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent stability with 83.52&#8201;% capacity retention over 200&#8197;cycles and excellent rate performance, suggesting its potential for next&#8208;generation large scale high&#8208;performance stationary energy storage systems.

         <title>Alkene Isomerization Revitalizes the Coates&#8211;Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18509-18513, August 16, 2021. </description>

The strategic use of alkene isomerization has enabled the first systematic study of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first discovered by Coates nearly forty years ago and rarely applied since. We explore the mediation of this rearrangement by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids and demonstrate the synthetic utility of the products through a concise synthesis of the iridoid natural product isoneomatatabiol.







Abstract
The [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first investigated by Coates nearly four decades ago, is set apart from other variants of the Claisen rearrangement owing to the versatile monoprotected 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl motif featured in the products. Unfortunately, the synthetically elusive nature of the substrates has thus far precluded the widespread application of this attractive transformation. Herein, we show that the key allylic vinyl acetals can be efficiently generated through alkene isomerization of their readily available regioisomeric counterparts (derived from allylic alcohols and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes), thus enabling the first systematic study of the substrate scope of this rearrangement, as well as the discovery of exceptionally mild conditions for its mediation by Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

         <title>A Primary Acyl Phosphine Stabilized by a Phosphonium Ylide</title>

The reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 and subsequent reactions are used to access Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 and Ph3PCHC(O)PH2. The zwitterionic nature of these species illustrates this new strategy to stabilization of acylphosphines. Indeed the latter species is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphine, devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.







Abstract
Primary acyl&#8208;phosphines are scarce in the literature. Here we show that the reaction of Ph3GePCO with the ylide Ph3PCH2 proceeds to give the species Ph3PCHC(O)PH(GePh3) 1. Deprotonation of 1 with Na[N(SiMe3)2] generates the salt [Na(THF)2][Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)] 2 which provides subsequent access to the bis&#8208;germanylated acylphosphine, Ph3PCHC(O)P(GePh3)2 3. Alternatively, treatment of 1 with HCl in dioxane affords the primary acylphosphine Ph3PCHC(O)PH2 4. Compound 4 is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines and the first devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.

A diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition that allows facile access to vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with at least one center in acyclic systems is described. The practical asymmetric cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of 2,2&#8208;diarylacetonitriles and a range of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic as well as acyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls proceeds in excellent yields and good to excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The asymmetric construction of vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with at least one moiety in acyclic systems is a formidable challenge.

     alt="Construction of Vicinal Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters Through Diastereo- and Enantioselective Oxidative 1,6-Conjugate Addition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diastereo- and enantioselective oxidative 1,6-conjugate addition that allows facile access to vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with at least one center in acyclic systems is described. The practical asymmetric cross-dehydrogenative coupling of 2,2-diarylacetonitriles and a range of &#945;-substituted cyclic as well as acyclic 1,3-dicarbonyls proceeds in excellent yields and good to excellent stereoselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric construction of vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with at least one moiety in acyclic systems is a formidable challenge. We disclose a solution involving diastereo- and enantioselective oxidative 1,6-conjugate addition. The practical asymmetric cross-dehydrogenative coupling of 2,2-diarylacetonitriles and diverse &#945;-substituted cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyls proceeds, for vicinal quaternary carbon stereocenters with one center in acyclic systems, in excellent yields and stereoselectivities.

Tricyclic cycl[3.2.2]azines, containing a central&#8208;ring&#8208;junction nitrogen atom, have been accessed through aminocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions. Pyrrolizine&#8208;based 8&#960;&#8208;components were prepared and used in catalytic [8+2] cycloaddition reactions with diverse activated enals. The developed procedure enabled the synthesis of the cycloadducts, which contain four adjacent stereocenters, with exceptional stereoselectivity (see scheme).







Abstract
An efficient and exceptionally stereoselective synthesis of chiral cycl[3.2.2]azines has been realized by means of the rational design and utilization of novel (E)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolizines in iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition reactions. The presented protocol allows for the incorporation of diverse enals, including cinnamaldehydes, enolizable aldehydes, and substrates of extended conjugation. The obtained products contain both an electron&#8208;rich alkenyl pyrrole moiety and an electron&#8208;deficient carbaldehyde substituent, and both moieties can undergo selective transformations with retention of the stereochemical information established in the [8+2] cycloaddition.

A highly atropo&#8208;enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of tetralone derivatives paired with aryl boronic esters as nucleophilic components is presented. The transformation is catalyzed by chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) iridium(III) complexes and enabled by oxidatively enhanced reductive elimination from high&#8208;valent cyclometalated Ir&#8208;species.







Abstract
Atropo&#8208;enantioselective biaryl coupling through C&#8722;H bond functionalization is an emerging technology allowing direct construction of axially chiral molecules. This approach is largely limited to electrophilic coupling partners. We report a highly atropo&#8208;enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of tetralone derivatives paired with aryl boronic esters as nucleophilic components. The transformation is catalyzed by chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) iridium(III) complexes and enabled by oxidatively enhanced reductive elimination from high&#8208;valent cyclometalated Ir&#8208;species.

An activated alkyl electrophile and a silicon electrophile can be reductively cross&#8208;coupled under nickel catalysis with elemental zinc as the stoichiometric reductant. This cross&#8208;electrophile coupling enables for the first time the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond from alkyl electrophiles with an &#945;&#8208;cyano group and chlorosilanes (see Scheme; dtbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl).







Abstract
A nickel/zinc&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl electrophiles activated by an &#945;&#8208;cyano group and chlorosilanes is reported. Elemental zinc is the stoichiometric reductant in this reductive coupling process. By this, a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond can be formed starting from two electrophilic reactants whereas previous methods rely on the combination of carbon nucleophiles and silicon electrophiles or vice versa.

         <title>Double Ionic&#8211;Electronic Transfer Interface Layers for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

The double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers between electrode and electrolyte were created by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene inside the solid&#8208;state lithium battery, resulting in low interface resistance and highly stable interface contact.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries is impeded by the physical limitations of the interface between the electrode and solid electrolyte; specifically, high resistance and poor stability, as well as poor compatibility with Li+ migration. We report double ionic&#8211;electronic transfer interface layers grown at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces by in&#8197;situ polymerization of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte. For all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4&#8741;PT&#8208;PEO&#8208;PT&#8741;Li cells, the formation of a conductive polythiophene (PT) layer at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface resulted in an at least sevenfold decrease in interface resistance, and realized a capacity retention of about 94&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles along with a lower polarization voltage under a rate of 2&#8197;C. The mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductive layers imparted superior interface stability and contact while keeping good compatibility with the Li anode.

         <title>Generation of Diazomethyl Radicals by Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Their Cycloaddition with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18484-18488, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the generation of diazomethyl radicals and their addition to alkenes is described. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the diazo carbon. This umpolung strategy overcomes the limitations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds with alkenes.







Abstract
A general catalytic methodology for the synthesis of pyrazolines from &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds and conjugated alkenes is reported.

&lt;p&gt;A new approach for the generation of diazomethyl radicals and their addition to alkenes is described. The direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from &#945;-diazo compounds generates electrophilic diazomethyl radicals, thereby reversing the reactivity of the diazo carbon. This umpolung strategy overcomes the limitations of electron-deficient alkenes in traditional dipolar [3+2]-cycloaddition of &#945;-diazo compounds with alkenes.

         <title>Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn&#8211;Teller Distortions of Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 34, Page 18519-18526, August 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;based Prussian Blue analogue prone to destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions upon oxidation is coated with an epitaxial layer of Ni&#8208;based Prussian Blue. This outer layer exerts an anisotropic strain on the lattice of the inner layer, largely preventing structural degradation during Na+ extraction and re&#8208;insertion. As a sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode, the material combines the high capacity and high stability of its two components.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based Prussian Blue, Na2&#8722;&#948;Mn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is a good candidate for sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. Herein, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel&#8208;based Prussian Blue (Na2&#8722;&#948;Ni[Fe(CN)6]). The one&#8208;pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core&#8211;shell materials, which usually needs several steps. The material has an electrochemical capacity of 93&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, of which it retains 96&#8201;% after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles (vs. 37&#8201;% for MnPB). Its rate capability is also remarkable: at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (ca. 55&#8197;C) it can reversibly store 70&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ca. 10&#8722;8&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The epitaxial outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, preventing the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de&#8208;sodiation.

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of N2 to Borylamine at a Molybdenum Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic formation of N&#8722;B bonds from atmospheric N2, chloroboranes and electrons is achieved with (triphosphine)molybdenum complexes.







Abstract
Catalytic formation of borylamines from atmospheric N2 is achieved for the first time using a series of homogenous (triphosphine)Mo complexes. Stepwise functionalization of the (triphosphine)Mo&#8208;nitrido complex with chloroborane led to the synthesis of the imido complex. Electrochemical characterization of the (PPP)Mo&#8208;nitrido and (PPP)Mo&#8208;borylimido complexes showed that the latter is much more easily reduced.

         <title>Understanding the Roles of Electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ in Selectivity&#8208;Tuned 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism for cobalt&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation is revealed. A combined experimental and theoretical study shows that a Co3+ species is capable of oxidizing the formyl group to produce carboxylate but remains inert towards oxidation of the hydroxyl group. In contrast, a Co4+ species is required for the initial oxidation of the hydroxyl group in HMF.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is among the most promising candidates for electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism of this catalyst remains unclear. We combine experimental evidence and a theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co3+ is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co4+ is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As a result, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co&#8208;catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals in situ Behaviors of Multiple Components in Aerosol Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to trace and quantify carbonaceous particles in&#8197;situ is reported by Jie Sun, Caiqiao Xiong, Zongxiu Nie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103874). The method provides not only spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub&#8208;organ level, but also chemical information of multiple components from these particles based on their intrinsic fingerprints upon laser ablation. This work provides a new ambition to understand how ambient particles translocate and release its surface organic matter in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Benchmark Acetylene Binding Affinity and Separation through Induced Fit in a Flexible Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the new flexible physisorbent sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn and reveal that it exhibits an induced fit structural change that results in extraordinary affinity for C2H2 that in turn enables high selectivity for separation of C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2.







Abstract
Structural changes at the active site of an enzyme induced by binding to a substrate molecule can result in enhanced activity in biological systems. Herein, we report that the new hybrid ultramicroporous material sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn exhibits an induced fit binding mechanism when exposed to acetylene, C2H2. The resulting phase change affords exceptionally strong C2H2 binding that in turn enables highly selective C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments. sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn was observed to exhibit at least four phases: as&#8208;synthesised (&#945;); activated (&#946;); and C2H2 induced phases (&#946;&#8242; and &#947;). sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; exhibited strong affinity for C2H2 at ambient conditions as demonstrated by benchmark isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of 67.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 validated through in situ pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG&#8208;DSC). Further, in situ characterisation and DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of the C2H2 induced fit transformation, binding positions and the nature of host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskites is improved thanks to the fluoride in SnF2. The anion of this typical additive is responsible for a more homogeneous nucleation in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin film formation. In addition, fluoride selectively complexes SnIV and prevents its incorporation in the perovskite structure, as reported by Jorge Pascual, Antonio Abate et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107599).

         <title>HPM&#8208;16, a Stable Interrupted Zeolite with a Multidimensional Mixed Medium&#8211;Large Pore System Containing Supercages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HPM&#8208;16 is a new interrupted zeolite with 3D intersecting 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8197;MR channels containing 30&#8197;&#197; long supercages. The structure, with a very long b&#8208;axis (&gt;50&#8197;&#197;), was solved by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D&#8197;electron diffraction. Degermanated HPM&#8208;16 is stable up to 800&#8201;&#176;C. Several derived structures were studied, including one recently reported.







Abstract
HPM&#8208;16 is a highly porous germanosilicate zeolite with an interrupted framework that contains a three&#8208;dimensional system of 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8208;membered ring (MR) pores. The 10(12)&#8197;MR pore in the b&#8197;direction is a 10&#8197;MR pore with long 12&#8197;MR stretches forming 30&#8197;&#197; long tubular supercages. Along one direction the 10&#8197;MR pores are fused, meaning that the separation between adjacent pores consists of a single tetrahedron that is, additionally, connected to only three additional tetrahedra (a Q3). These fused pores are thus decorated by T&#8208;OH groups along the whole diffusion path, creating a hydrophilic region embedded in an otherwise essentially hydrophobic environment. The structure is built from highly porous 12&#215;12&#215;12&#8197;MR uninterrupted layers that are connected to each other through Q3 producing a second system of 10&#215;10&#215;10&#8197;MR pores. This zeolite can be extensively degermanated yielding a material with high thermal stability, despite its interrupted nature.

         <title>Ethane&#8208;Based Catalytic Process for Vinyl Chloride Manufacture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective and stable chlorination of ethane into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, a key intermediate for the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is demonstrated over rare earth oxychloride catalysts, which will allow record productivities of vinyl chloride upon thermal cracking. This process paves the way for manufacturing PVC from natural gas instead of the currently applied ethylene (oil) or acetylene (coal), bringing significant cost and environmental benefits.

The use of ethane as a platform molecule for the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a longstanding challenge, which would allow to reduce the raw material costs and CO2 emissions to produce this plastic. Herein, we discover that rare earth oxychlorides catalyze in a selective (up to 90&#8201;%) and stable (&gt;50&#8197;h on stream) manner the reaction of ethane and molecular chlorine into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, which, upon established cracking, will translate into an order of magnitude higher vinyl chloride productivity compared to ethane oxychlorination technologies. In addition, representative europium oxychloride was supported on suitable carriers and was demonstrated to be selective (up to 90&#8201;%) and stable (&gt;40&#8197;h on stream) in extrudate form. These findings bring the ethane&#8208;based production of PVC one step closer to implementation.

&lt;p&gt;The selective and stable chlorination of ethane into 1,2-dichloroethane, a key intermediate for the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is demonstrated over rare earth oxychloride catalysts, which will allow record productivities of vinyl chloride upon thermal cracking. This process paves the way for manufacturing PVC from natural gas instead of the currently applied ethylene (oil) or acetylene (coal), bringing significant cost and environmental benefits.

         <title>Grotthuss Proton Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new energy storage materials with both high power and energy densities has attracted great interest for electrochemical supercapacitor application. Herein, we synthesize two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox&#8208;active azo groups in COFs can undergo a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making them ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in&#8208;situ hybridized with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three&#8208;electrode specific capacitance of 440 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g, among the highest COF&#8208;based supercapacitors, and can retain 90% capacitances even after 10000 charge/discharge cycles. This work realized the first example using Grotthuss proton&#8208;conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two&#8208;electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71 Wh/kg with a maximum power density of 42 kW/kg, surpassing all reported COF&#8208;based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photons are traceless reagents in the photocatalytic system, able to control the reaction pathway. Herein, the carbon nitride photocatalyst is used to obtain three products from the same reaction mixture only varying the excitation light. The developed method is optimized for the synthesis of sulfonyl chlorides and amides. Finally, through different physico&#8208;chemical methods, the rationale behind the chromoselective synthesis is explained.







Abstract
Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one&#8212;light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.

Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K-PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S-arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi-electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis as Efficient Tool for the Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydroxamic Acids for Acyl Nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxamic acids were electrochemically oxidised to initiate acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with 1,3&#8208;dienes. By using alternating current, their often encountered electrochemical induced decomposition could be suppressed to generate the desired cycloaddition products in up to 96&#8201;% yield. The optimisation of this reaction was performed using the Design of Experiments approach.







Abstract
The acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with electrochemically oxidised hydroxamic acids is described. By using alternating current electrolysis, their typical electro&#8208;induced decomposition could be suppressed in favour of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine cycloaddition products. The reaction was optimised using Design of Experiments (DoE) and a sensitivity test was conducted. A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3&#8208;dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Correlating Charge Transport Properties of Conjugated Polymers in Solution Aggregates and Thin&#8208;Film Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different aggregation structures of three BDOPV&#8208;based polymers in solution were obtained via subtle adjustment of the molecular structures. By employing contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we directly reveal that the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains highly consistent.







Abstract
The role of solution aggregates on the charge transport process of conjugated polymers in electronic devices has gained increasing attention; however, the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains elusive. Herein, three polymers, FBDOPV&#8208;2T, FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T, and FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T, are designed and synthesized with distinct aggregation behavior in solution. By combining contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor measurements, we track the charge carrier mobility of the aggregates of these polymers from the solution to the thin&#8208;film state. Remarkably, the mobility of these three polymers is found to follow nearly the same trend (FBDOPV&#8208;2T&gt;FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T&#8811;FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T) in both solutions and thin&#8208;film states. The quantitative mobility correlation indicates that the charge transport properties of solution aggregates play a critical role in determining the thin&#8208;film charge transport properties and final device performance. Our results highlight the importance of investigating and controlling solution aggregation structures towards efficient organic electronic devices.

A dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which showing excellent charge collection properties and multisite defect&#8208;healing effects. All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. All&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the known chemistry for the preparation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives reported up to mid&#8208;2021. Bridge substitution on BCP derivatives often provides patent&#8208;free, novel vectors for substituent disposition in drug discovery and materials science; this capacity may prove to be transformational in the coming years.







Abstract
&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This Minireview aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.

One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well-documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This Minireview aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cooperative Effects in Switchable Catalysis: Enhancing Double&#8208;Click Reaction Yield of Symmetrical Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like an eagle spreading its wings wide, the closed structure opens its hidden catalytic sites upon addition of an iron trigger thus furnishing a cavity for a double&#8208;click conversion toward rotaxanes. Surprisingly, a close distance match is not needed for double activation.







Abstract
Reversible switching between the closed cyclic dimeric assembly [Cu2(1)2]2+ (OFF state) and the extended dimeric homoleptic complex [FeCu2(1)2]4+ (ON State) by addition/removal of Fe2+ triggered catalysis of a double&#8208;click reaction and high yield preparation of [2]rotaxanes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide valuable general insight for double&#8208;click strategies by revealing cooperative effects in the second cycloaddition step due to a distance&#8208;tolerant preorganization of the first&#8208;click product by the two copper(I)&#8208;loaded phenanthroline subunits of [FeCu2(1)2]4+.

         <title>Modulating the Efficacy of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors through Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination can have important beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, but these effects can sometimes be difficult to predict. Using the vast amount of data obtained on selective, fluorinated inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, this Minireview attempts to give general guidelines on how to wisely insert fluorine atoms within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
The insertion of fluorine atoms and/or fluoroalkyl groups can lead to many beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, such as enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability, as well as a strengthening of protein&#8211;ligand binding interactions. However, this &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of fluorine atom(s) insertion can often be meaningless. Taking advantage of the wide range of data coming from the quest for carbonic anhydrase (CA) fluorinated inhibitors, this Minireview attempts to give &#8220;general guidelines&#8221; on how to wisely insert fluorine atom(s) within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions, depending on the target location of the fluorine substitution in the ligand. Multiple approaches such as ITC, kinetic and inhibition studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy are useful in dissecting single binding contributions to the overall observed effect. The exploitation of innovative directions made in the field of protein and ligand&#8208;based fluorine NMR screening is also discussed to avoid misconduct and finely tune the exploitation of selective fluorine atom insertion in the future.

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Regulation of Cellular Morphology Using a Photoswitchable Mechanical DNA Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created a photoswitchable DNA polymer containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides with photoirradiation. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells. This study presents a general strategy to explore nanoscale interactions between stem cells and stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanostructures.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) in which the cells reside provides a dynamic and reversible environment. Spatiotemporal cues are essential when cells are undergoing morphogenesis, repair and differentiation. Emulation of such an intricate system with reversible presentation of nanoscale cues can help us better understand cellular processes and can allow the precise manipulation of cell function in&#8197;vitro. Herein, we formulated a photoswitchable DNA mechanical nanostructure containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides using a photoswitchable DNA polymer with photoirradiation. We found that the DNA polymer reversibly forms two different structures, a relaxed linear and shrunken compact form, observed by AFM. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells between a round shape and spindle shape, thus providing a tool to decipher the language of the ECM better.

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been established. B2cat2 serves as a borylating agent, but also activates the carboxylic acid substrate towards decarbonylative coupling, playing a dual role in this reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals that the reaction proceeds through a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni0 catalysts. The key to achieve this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of B2cat2 as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8722;O bond to Ni0 catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron&#8208;promoted carboxylic acid activation is also applicable to other types of reactions.

         <title>Nano&#8208;analysis reveals high fraction of serotonin release during exocytosis from a gut epithelium model cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut&#8208;derived 5&#8208;HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5&#8208;HT release in BON cells is 80% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34%). The fractional release increased from 80% in control BON cells to 87% with 5&#8208;HT preincubation and nearly 100% with the combination of 5&#8208;HT and the 5HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5&#8208;HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Amidation&#160;of Esters via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct mechanochemical amidation of esters &#8211; enabled by ball&#8208;milling &#8211; is herein described. The operationally simple procedure requires inputs of ester, amine, and sub&#8208;stoichiometric KOtBu and is applicable to a preparation of a large and diverse library of 78 amide structures with modest to excellent efficiency. Heteroaromatic and heterocyclic components are specifically shown to be amenable to this mechanochemical protocol. This direct synthesis platform has been applied to the synthesis of API&#8217;s, agrochemicals, and its ability to deliver gram&#8208;scale synthesis of active pharmaceuticals and building blocks is demonstrated, all in the absence of a reaction solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of Zinc onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the Ionic Liquid [MPPip][TFSI]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differences of the electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide are presented. The clearly different structures of the deposits on both gold single crystal electrodes reveal a strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc.







Abstract
The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. We now show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ molecular engineering of structure defect manufacturing and O&#8208;doping unlocks the MoS2 basal plane and simultaneously upgrades its interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity. These merits enable highly efficient 3D Zn&#8208;ion transport in the MoS2 lattice along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus rendering the fast reaction kinetics and the exceptional rate performance in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;storage behaviors of MoS2&#8208;based cathodes mainly rely on the ion&#8208;(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in&#8208;situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O&#8208;doping is proposed for MoS2 (designated as D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), and produce abundant 1T&#8208;phase. The tailored D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O with excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the 3D Zn2+ transport along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus achieving the exceptional high rate capability. Zn2+ diffusion through the basal plane is verified by DFT computations. As a proof of concept, the wearable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn battery employing the D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O cathode operates stably even under severe bending conditions, showing great application prospects. This work opens a new window for designing high&#8208;performance layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Macrocyclization and Multifunctionalization via Dipyrrin Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin staple construction is introduced, where the dipyrrin moiety serves as a novel multifunctional staple linker for targeted protein imaging and selective metal sensing.







Abstract
We introduce a new and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin construction, with full scope of proteinogenic amino acids and different ring sizes. Various bicyclic peptides can be created by dipyrrin&#8208;based crosslinking and double dipyrrin&#8208;ring formation. The embedded dipyrrin can be either transformed to fluorescent BODIPY and then utilized as cancer&#8208;selective targeted protein imaging probe in vitro, or directly employed as a selective metal sensor in aqueous media. This work provides a valuable addition to the peptide macrocyclization toolbox, and a blueprint for the development of multifunctional dipyrrin linkers in cyclopeptides for a wide range of potential bioapplications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillating Actuators with Phototactic Locomotion Based on Black Phosphorus Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of photoacutator based on a heterostructured black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid presents high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven reversible actuation. By using the BP&#8208;based actuator as the working unit, together with the self&#8208;oscillating configuration and asymmetric structure design, an inchworm&#8208;like soft actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed.







Abstract
Developing self&#8208;oscillating soft actuators that enable autonomous, continuous, and directional locomotion is significant in biomimetic soft robotics fields, but remains great challenging. Here, an untethered soft photoactuators based on covalently&#8208;bridged black phosphorus&#8208;carbon nanotubes heterostructure with self&#8208;oscillation and phototactic locomotion under constant light irradiation is designed. Owing to the good photothermal effect of black phosphorus heterostructure and thermal deformation of the actuator components, the new actuator assembled by heterostructured black phosphorus, polymer and paper produces light&#8208;driven reversible deformation with fast and large response. By using this actuator as mechanical power and designing a robot configuration with self&#8208;feedback loop to generate self&#8208;oscillation, an inchworm&#8208;like actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed. Moreover, due to the anisotropy and tailorability of the actuator, an artificial crab robot that can simulate the sideways locomotion of crabs and simultaneously change color under light irradiation is also realized.

         <title>A Covalent Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Superlattice Covered with Organic Functional Groups for Highly Sensitive and Selective Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid superlattice was designed and synthesized with a facile coordination assembly method. The surface functional groups and interlayer charge transport render the superlattice nanosheets an excellent gas sensing material with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit, and exceptional selectivity towards NO2 at room temperature among all fast&#8208;response gas&#8208;sensing materials without the need of light assistance.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid superlattices (OIHSLs) hold attractive physical and chemical properties, while the construction of single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSLs has not been achieved. Herein a coordination assembly strategy was proposed to create a single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSL PbBDT (BDT=1,4&#8208;benzenedithiolate), where layered [PbS2] sublattice covalently connects with benzene sublattice. The covalent bonding offers better thermo&#8208;/chemi&#8208;stability, inter&#8208;sublattice electron transport, and unique organic&#8208;group&#8208;functionalized surface, which may enable better performances in chemical applications than non&#8208;covalent OIHSL. These features endow PbBDT with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit and excellent selectivity towards NO2 at room temperature among all chemiresistive gas&#8208;sensing materials with reported response time less than 2&#8197;min without the need of light assistance.

         <title>Twofold C&#8722;H Activation&#8208;Based Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8722;H Arylation Using Diarylacetylenes as Rare Arylating Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of phosphinamides and diarylacetylenes has been realized for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral biaryls bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The reaction proceeded via twofold C&#8722;H bond activation, with the alkynes being an arylating reagent.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation has been established as an attractive strategy to access axially chiral biaryls, and the most straightforward method is direct C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. However, the arylating source has been limited to several classes of reactive and bulky reagents. Reported herein is rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of diarylphosphinic amides and diarylacetylenes for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of biaryls with both central and axial chirality. This twofold C&#8722;H activation reaction stays contrast to the previously explored Miura&#8211;Satoh type 1:2 coupling of arenes and alkynes in terms of chemoselectivity and proceeded under mild conditions with the alkyne acting as a rare arylating reagent. Both C&#8722;H activation events are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control, with the 2nd C&#8722;H activation being diastereo&#8208;determining in a remote fashion. Analysis of the stereochemistry of the major and side products suggests moderate enantioselectivity of the initial C&#8722;H activation&#8211;desymmetrization process. However, the minor (R) rhodium vinyl intermediate is consumed more readily in undesired protonolysis, eventually resulting in high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the major product.

         <title>A Boratafulvene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first boratafulvene was accessed by deprotonation of a B&#8208;methyl borole. The boratafulvene is a new C&#8208;nucleophilic synthon for substituted boroles and reacts with carbonyls in a bora&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type reaction transferring the methylene group.







Abstract
Structurally authenticated free B&#8208;alkyl boroles are presented and electronic implications of alkyl substitution were assessed. Deprotonation of a boron&#8208;bound exocyclic methyl group in a B&#8208;methyl borole yields the first 5&#8208;boratafulvene anion&#8212;an isomer to boratabenzene. Boratafulvene was structurally characterized and its electronic structure probed by DFT calculations. The pKa value of the exocyclic B&#8722;CH3 in a set of boroles was computationally approximated and confirmed a pronounced acidic character caused by the boron atom embedded in an anti&#8208;aromatic moiety. The non&#8208;aromatic boratafulvene reacts as a C&#8208;centered nucleophile with the mild electrophile Me3SnCl to give a stannylmethyl borole, regenerating the anti&#8208;aromaticity. As nucleophilic synthons for boroles, boratafulvenes thus open an entirely new avenue for synthetic strategies toward this highly reactive class of heterocycles. Boratafulvene reacts as a methylene transfer reagent in a bora&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type reaction generating a borole oxide.

         <title>Electrophilic Aminating Agents in Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review outlines the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis. A wide range of C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming methods are highlighted, including polar, radical and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Classical amination methods involve the reaction of a nitrogen nucleophile with an electrophilic carbon center; however, in recent years, umpoled strategies have gained traction where the nitrogen source acts as an electrophile. A wide range of electrophilic aminating agents are now available, and these underpin a range of powerful C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming processes. In this Review, we highlight the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photoredox Catalysis Enables Self&#8208;Reporting Nitric Oxide Release for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis for self&#8208;reporting nitric oxide release is reported in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin. The NO&#8208;releasing platform eradicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treats bacterial infection in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a key regulator of many physiological processes and as a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non&#8208;invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO&#8208;releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near&#8208;UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity.

&lt;p&gt;Red-light-mediated photoredox catalysis for self-reporting nitric oxide release is reported in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a key regulator of many physiological processes and as a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non-invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO-releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near-UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity. We report that coumarin-based NO donors with maximal absorbances at 328&#8197;nm can be activated under (deep) red-light (630 or 700&#8197;nm) irradiation in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin, enabling stoichiometric and self-reporting NO release with a photolysis quantum yield of 8&#8201;% via photoredox catalysis. This NO-releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in&#8197;vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Discrete Self&#8208;Assembled Metallo&#8208;Foldamers with Heteroleptic Sequence Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A turn for the better: ligands with orthogonal binding&#8208;site pairings allow the self&#8208;assembly of discrete heteroleptic PdII&#8208;containing sequences. These adopt persistent conformations in solution, allowing &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; metallo&#8208;foldamer formation under thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Discrete and structurally diverse foldamer sequences are constructed in both natural and abiotic systems primarily using inert connectivity with irreversible organic covalent bonds, serving to preserve the identity of the sequence. The formation of sequences under thermodynamic control using labile coordination bonds would be attractive for synthetic ease and modular capability, but this presents issues regarding sequence preservation. Here is presented an approach integrating palladium(II) metal ions into the sequence itself, with fidelity maintained through use of complementary pairings of ligand arrangements at the metal centre. This is accomplished using sites of different denticity and/or hydrogen bonding capability. In this fashion, discrete and ordered metallo&#8208;sequences are formed as thermodynamic products in a single step, and these then fold into defined conformations due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aromatic regions of the combined componentry.

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8211;Dipole Interaction Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipole&#8211;dipole interaction induced self&#8208;assembly of phenoxazine&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting material, N01, is achieved by introducing a hexyl bromide side&#8208;chain to tune its self&#8208;assembling properties. N01 exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, extraction and perovskite growth, with a conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;% to be realized in an inverted PSC.







Abstract
Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs, N01 and N02, which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(n&#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. The N01 molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. Consequently, N01 as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;%.

         <title>Photoinduced Charge Separation Prompted Intervalence Charge Transfer in a Bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole Bridged Donor&#8208;TCBD Push&#8208;Pull System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Occurrence of intervalence charge transfer in a newly synthesized multi&#8208;modular donor&#8211;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl) diketopyrrolopyrrole hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene entities on the opposite sides is demonstrated. The near&#8208;infrared IVCT band has been used as a diagnostic marker to probe photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ&#8208;TCBD) entities on the opposite sides. One&#8208;electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. The stabilization energy, &#8722;&#916;Gcom and comproportionation equilibrium constant, Kcom calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06&#215;104&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and 72.3&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (kcs&#8776;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system. The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.

         <title>Robust and Versatile Coatings Engineered via Simultaneous Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial assemblies are spontaneously formed on various substrates in aqueous conditions via simultaneous covalent and noncovalent interactions using tannic acid and the small aromatic molecule benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. The robust and colorless coatings enable the subsequent on&#8208;surface synthesis or modification for the development of various multifunctional coatings and nanosystems.







Abstract
Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT&#8208;TA), self&#8208;assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self&#8208;polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40&#8197;nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT&#8208;TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;&#8208;&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100&#8197;mM NaCl, HCl (pH&#8197;1) or NaOH (pH&#8197;13), and water at 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100&#8197;mM Triton X&#8208;100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco's phosphate&#8208;buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT&#8208;TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF&#8208;8 shells) via phenolic&#8208;mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.

         <title>Porphyrinic MOF Film for Multifaceted Electrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework on a conductive indium tin oxide surface affords an electrochemical sensor, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO. Thanks to detecting several inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO demonstrates multifaceted sensing with low detection limits. Benchmark sensing performances are set not only across several single components, but also in the corresponding binary and ternary mixtures.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensors are indispensable in clinical diagnosis, biochemical detection and environmental monitoring, thanks to their ability to detect analytes in real&#8208;time with direct electronic readout. However, electrochemical sensors are challenged by sensitivity&#8212;the need to detect low concentrations, and selectivity&#8212;to detect specific analytes in multicomponent systems. Herein, a porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic framework (PP&#8208;MOF), Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222 is deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) surface. It affords Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO, a versatile voltammetric sensor able to detect redox&#8208;active analytes such as inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, including nitroaromatics, phenolic and quinone&#8208;hydroquinone toxins, heavy metal ions, biological species, as well as azo dyes. As a working electrode, the high surface area of Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO enables high currents, and therefore leverages highly sensitive analysis. The metalloporphyrin centre facilitates analyte&#8208;specific redox catalysis to simultaneously detect more than one analyte in binary and ternary systems allowing for detection of a wide array of trace pollutants under real&#8208;world conditions, most with high sensitivity.

         <title>Activating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores via External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect and Rigidity of Ionic Polymer Matrix**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping strategy to directly transform commercial fluorescent dyes to pure organic, amorphous phosphorescent materials is developed via a single ionic polymer. The external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates the triplet states, while the rigid ionic bonding matrix inhibits the nonradiative decay. This general strategy provides a method to activate room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and a powerful tool for studying triplet states.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted wide attention for their easy preparation, low toxicity, and applications in various fields like bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Developing phosphorescent systems with more universality and less difficulty in synthesis has long been the pursuit of materials scientists. By employing a polymeric quaternary ammonium salt with an ionic bonding matrix and heavy atoms, commercial fluorescent dyes are directly endowed with phosphorescence emission. In a single amorphous polymer, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates excited triplet states and the rigid polymer matrix stabilizes them. This study put forward a new general strategy to design and develop pure organic RTP materials starting from existing library of organic dyes without complicated chemical synthesis.

         <title>Reversible Ligand Exchange in Atomically Dispersed Catalysts for Modulating the Activity and Selectivity of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination environments of atomically dispersed catalysts are important for their catalytic performances. We report the reversible control of the metal coordination environment in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via simple ligand exchange reactions, which could reversibly modulate the catalytic reactivity of the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Rational control of the coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalysts is pivotal to achieve desirable catalytic reactivity. We report the reversible control of coordination structure in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via ligand exchange reactions to reversibly modulate their reactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CO&#8208;ligated atomically dispersed Rh catalyst exhibited ca. 30&#8208;fold higher ORR activity than the NHx&#8208;ligated catalyst, whereas the latter showed three times higher H2O2 selectivity than the former. Post&#8208;treatments of the catalysts with CO or NH3 allowed the reversible exchange of CO and NHx ligands, which reversibly tuned oxidation state of metal centers and their ORR activity and selectivity. DFT calculations revealed that more reduced oxidation state of CO&#8208;ligated Rh site could further stabilize the *OOH intermediate, facilitating the two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron pathway ORR. The reversible ligand exchange reactions were generalized to Ir&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Identification of M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2 Intermediate and Rate Determining Step for Nitrogen Reduction with Bioinspired Sulfur&#8208;Bonded FeW Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized for a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst. In&#8197;situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process.







Abstract
The multimetallic sulfur&#8208;framework catalytic site of biological nitrogenases allows the efficient conversion of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized as a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst by sulfur substitution of the surface of FeWO4 nanoparticles. Thus prepared FeWSx@FeWO4 catalysts exhibit a relatively high NH3 production rate of 30.2&#8197;ug&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 16.4&#8201;% at &#8722;0.45&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell; these results have been confirmed via purified 15N2&#8208;isotopic labeling experiments. In situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of the bimetallic sulfide catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process. Therefore, this work can provide guidance for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relationship of NRR catalysts.

         <title>Noncovalently Functionalized Commodity Polymers as Tailor&#8208;Made Additives for Stereoselective Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy to fabricate &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives by attaching chiral small molecules onto achiral commodity polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions is developed. These supramolecular additives were used in the stereoselective crystallization of various racemates and yielded enantiopure crystals with opposite configurations to the chiral moieties.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition of the nucleation and crystal growth of one enantiomer aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient method to obtain enantiopure compounds. However, the conventional preparation of polymeric additives from chiral monomers are laborious and limited in structures, which impedes their rapid optimization and applicability. Herein, we report a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; strategy to facilitate synthesis by using commercially available achiral polymers as the platform to attach various chiral small molecules as the recognition side&#8208;chains through non&#8208;covalent interactions. A library of supramolecular polymers made up of two vinyl polymers and six small molecules were applied with seeds in the selective crystallization of seven racemates in different solvents. They showed good to excellent stereoselectivity in yielding crystals with high enantiomeric purities in conglomerates and racemic compound forming systems. This convenient, low&#8208;cost modular synthesis strategy of polymeric additives will allow for high&#8208;efficient, economical resolution of various racemates on different scales.

         <title>Multistage Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Host&#8211;Guest Doping Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of different conjugation degrees on the quantum yield and lifetime of room temperature phosphorescence in a host&#8211;guest system is discussed. Multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved by introducing a pyridine group into the guest molecule. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing.







Abstract
Compared with inorganic long&#8208;lasting luminescent materials, organic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) ones show several advantages, such as flexibility, transparency, solubility and color adjustability. However, organic RTP materials close to commercialization are still to be developed. In this work, we developed a new host&#8211;guest doping system with stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics, in which triphenylphosphine oxide (OPph3) acted host and benzo(dibenzo)phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as guests. Turn&#8208;on RTP effect was realized by mixing them together through co&#8208;crystallization or grinding, in which the efficient energy transfer from host to guest and the strong intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the guest have played significant role. Further on, multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved via introducing pyridine group into the guest molecule. In addition, the anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized for these materials through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing, which brings RTP materials closer to commercialization.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Elucidation of Bisdibenzocorannulene in Multiple Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction/oxidation of a new type of curved &#960;&#8208;network (BDBC) provided access to its multiple redox states. For the one&#8208;electron reduced state, the BDBC.&#8722; was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a solvent&#8208;separated radical anion; while the two&#8208;electron oxidized state was revealed as an unusual singlet diradical dication (BDBC..)2+. As a consequence of their redox behaviours, their structures and ring currents have large differences.







Abstract
We report an anti&#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (BDBC) featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation. Chemical reduction of BDBC by stoichiometric addition of metallic potassium in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 ether, provided a radical anion BDBC.&#8722; and a dianion BDBC2&#8722;, respectively; while chemical oxidation by silver hexafluoroantimonate(V), converted the neutral compound to an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical dication (BDBC..)2+. The structural consequences of both electron&#8208;reduction and oxidation were closely related to the release of ring&#8208;strain of the bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;scaffold and imposed steric hindrance of the hexagonal bridge. In addition, the unusual open&#8208;shell nature of the dication could mainly be attributed to the changing of localized antiaromaticity in the closed&#8208;shell structure to delocalized character in the biradical, and thus the emergence of weakly bonded &#960;&#8208;electrons.

         <title>Discharge&#8208;Induced Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current mechanism studies mainly concern on surface reconstruction at high potential with respect to formation of high&#8208;valence metal sites and metal oxyhydroxides. The understanding of correlation between low potential scanning, surface structure, and electrochemical activity is lacking. This work suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction induced by the applied potential is of great significance for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we show that a previously overlooked discharge current in the low applied potential region also leads to in situ electrochemical activation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped nickel oxyhydroxide surface. We exploit the fact that doping of heteroatoms weakens the surface structure, and hence, a weak discharge current originating from the capacitive nature of nickel oxyhydroxide has a strong structure&#8208;reforming ability to promote the formation of nitrogen and oxygen vacancies. The current density at 1.4&#8197;V (vs. Hg/HgO) can dramatically increase by as much as 31.3&#8201;% after discharge in the low applied potential region. This work provides insight into in situ enhancement of the OER and suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Di(indenyl)beryllium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final puzzle piece fits in! Beryllium is the last of the non&#8208;radioactive s&#8208;block metals to be coordinated to indenyl ligands. Milling K[C9H7] with BeBr2 produces the indenyl complex [Be(C9H7)2]. Its crystal structure reveals mixed &#951;5/&#951;1 ring coordination. The monomeric &#8220;half&#8208;sandwich&#8221; complex [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] is available via the same method.







Abstract
The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp2], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#951;1&#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;5 &#8644; &#951;3 shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#8242;] + BeX2 in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr2 and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C9H7)2] (1) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] (2). The former displays &#951;5/&#951;1&#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that an &#951;5/&#951;5&#8208;conformation is less than 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy.

         <title>Green Conversion of CO2 and Propargylamines Triggered by Triply Synergistic Catalytic Effects in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed valence copper&#8208;based cationic framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n was synthesized. The material realized the efficient and green conversion of propargylamine with CO2 in flue gas under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst free conditions.







Abstract
Cyclization of propargylamines with CO2 to obtain 2&#8208;oxazolidone heterocyclic compounds is an essential reaction in industry but it is usually catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal catalysts with organic bases as co&#8208;catalysts under harsh conditions. We have synthesized a unique CuI/CuII mixed valence copper&#8208;based framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n (1) with good solvent and thermal stability, as well as a high density of uncoordinated amino groups evenly distributed in the large nanoscopic channels. Catalytic experiments show that 1 can effectively catalyze the reaction of propargylamines with CO2, and the yield can reach 99&#8201;%. The turnover frequency (TOF) reaches a record value of 230&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of reported noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Importantly, this is the first report of heterogeneously catalyzed green conversion of propargylamines with CO2 without solvents and co&#8208;catalysts under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. A mechanistic study reveals that a triply synergistic catalytic effect between CuI/CuII and uncoordinated amino groups promotes highly efficient and green conversion of CO2. Furthermore, 1 directly catalyzes this reaction with high efficiency when using simulated flue gas as a CO2 source.

         <title>Influence of Backbone Curvature on the Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance of Glycolated Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted design of backbone geometries is shown to influence the p&#8208;type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance of two glycolated donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers, PgBT(F)2gT and PgBT(F)2gTT.







Abstract
Two new glycolated semiconducting polymers PgBT(F)2gT and PgBT(F)2gTT of differing backbone curvatures were designed and synthesised for application as p&#8208;type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) materials. Both polymers demonstrated stable and reversible oxidation, accessible within the aqueous electrochemical window, to generate polaronic charge carriers. OECTs fabricated from PgBT(F)2gT featuring a curved backbone geometry attained a higher volumetric capacitance of 170&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3. However, PgBT(F)2gTT with a linear backbone displayed overall superior OECT performance with a normalised peak transconductance of 3.00&#215;104&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, owing to its enhanced order, expediting the charge mobility to 0.931&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused Tri[8]annulenes as Molecular Models of Cubic Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two benzo&#8208;fused tri[8]annulenes were synthesized via cyclotrimerization reactions, introducing two valid model compounds of the yet elusive carbon allotrope cubic graphite. Both conformers do not interconvert via temperature&#8208; or light&#8208;induced stimuli.







Abstract
Cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[3,4:7,8]cycloocta[1,2&#8208;l]phenanthrene with potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in the presence of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst afforded two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon stereoisomers consisting of three cyclooctatetraene (COT) moieties connected via a central benzene ring. Both isomeric tri[8]annulenes were obtained selectively through the choice of the catalyst: The &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;form (Ru catalyst) displayed a threefold symmetrywith the COT subunits forming the side walls of a (chiral) molecular cup. In the thermodynamically more stable &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;isomer (Pd catalyst), one of the three boat&#8208;shaped COTs was flipped over and faced the opposite molecular hemisphere with respect to the central benzene ring as evidenced by crystal structure analysis. Both title compounds are small segments of &#8220;cubic graphite&#8221;, an elusive carbon allotrope.

A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary.







Abstract
C&#8208;vinyl glycosides are an important class of carbohydrates and pose a unique synthetic challenge. A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary. Both the &#947; C&#8722;H bond of allylamines and the &#948; C&#8722;H bond of homoallyl amine substrates can be glycosylated in high efficiency and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The resulting C&#8208;vinyl glycosides can be further converted to a variety of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high stereospecificity. These reactions offer a broadly applicable method to streamline the synthesis of complex C&#8208;vinyl glycosides from easily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic Gating of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes by Controlling Protein Orientation in Biosensing Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations allowed the control of local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulation of the conductance gating effect upon sensing protein targets.







Abstract
The ability to detect proteins through gating conductance by their unique surface electrostatic signature holds great potential for improving biosensing sensitivity and precision. Two challenges are: (1) defining the electrostatic surface of the incoming ligand protein presented to the conductive surface; (2) bridging the Debye gap to generate a measurable response. Herein, we report the construction of nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations; this allowed us to control the local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulate the conductance gating effect upon binding incoming protein targets. Using a &#946;&#8208;lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the capture protein attached to carbon nanotube field effect transistors in different defined orientations. Device conductance had influence on binding TEM&#8208;1, an important &#946;&#8208;lactamase involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Conductance increased or decreased depending on TEM&#8208;1 presenting either negative or positive local charge patches, demonstrating that local electrostatic properties, as opposed to protein net charge, act as the key driving force for electrostatic gating. This, in turn can, improve our ability to tune the gating of electrical biosensors toward optimized detection, including for AMR as outlined herein.

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal chemical synthesis platform was extended by online NMR to allow adjustments of the encoded reactions on the fly. The approach was demonstrated on the class of Grignard reactions showing robust analytical results under harsh conditions. Real&#8208;time process analytics and the use of straightforward feedback control algorithm enhance the usability of available synthesis formula considering existing deviations.







Abstract
A big problem with the chemistry literature is that it is not standardized with respect to precise operational parameters, and real time corrections are hard to make without expert knowledge. This lack of context means difficult reproducibility because many steps are ambiguous, and hence depend on tacit knowledge. Here we present the integration of online NMR into an automated chemical synthesis machine (CSM aka. &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; which is capable of small&#8208;molecule synthesis using a universal programming language) to allow automated analysis and adjustment of reactions on the fly. The system was validated and benchmarked by using Grignard reactions which were chosen due to their importance in synthesis. The system was monitored in real time using online&#8208;NMR, and spectra were measured continuously during the reactions. This shows that the synthesis being done in the Chemputer can be dynamically controlled in response to feedback optimizing the reaction conditions according to the user requirements.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Cycloisomerization of Alkynoic Acids with Napthalenediimide&#8208;Derived N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a series of rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes with a naphthalene&#8208;di&#8208;imide N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that behave as effective redox&#8208;switchable catalysts for the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. The catalysts can adopt three electronically different stages with distinct catalytic activities. The activity of catalysts can toggle between the activated and inactivated forms for several cycles.







Abstract
Two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) bis&#8208;imidazolium salts have been used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors for the preparation of NDI&#8208;functionalized complexes of rhodium and iridium of general formula [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] (M=Rh, Ir; NDI&#8208;NHC=NDI&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand). Comparison of the IR spectra of the complexes [IrCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(CO)2] and their related one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduced forms, reveal that each one&#8208;electron reduction produces a decrease of the average &#957;(CO) of 9&#8211;10&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a significant enhancement of the electron&#8208;richness of the metal. The [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] complexes were tested in the catalytic cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. The one&#8208;electron reduced forms showed greatly enhanced activities. For the cyclization of 5&#8208;hexynoic acid, the two&#8208;electron reduction of the ligand produced further enhancement of the catalytic activity, therefore showing that the catalyst can switch between three redox species with three distinct catalytic activities.

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Resolution of Two Racemic Compounds by Preferential Cocrystallization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two racemic compounds are combined to form a stable conglomerate system. Both compounds are simultaneously resolved through a single preferential cocrystallization process, showing excellent enantiopurity towards both compounds.







Abstract
We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds RS&#8208;mandelic acid (MAN) and RS&#8208;etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R&#8208;MAN&#8901;R&#8208;ETI and S&#8208;MAN&#8901;S&#8208;ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve both compounds. The developed process leads to excellent enantiopurity both for etiracetam (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) and mandelic acid (ee&#8776;95&#8201;%) enantiomers.

         <title>Preparation of bulk&#8208;phase nitride perovskite LaReN3 and topotactic reduction to LaNiO2&#8208;type LaReN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide and oxide perovskites are numerous and many display outstanding properties, ABN  3  perovskite nitrides are extremely rare due synthetic challenges arising from the low chemical potential of nitrogen and a tendency to form low&#8208;coordination nitridometallate anions. Here we report the preparation of a perovskite nitride LaReN  3  through azide&#8208;mediated oxidation at high pressure. High&#8208;resolution synchrotron diffraction shows that LaReN  3  has a low symmetry, triclinic, perovskite superstructure resulting from orbital ordering with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling distortions. Topotactic reduction of LaReN  3  above 500 &#176;C leads to layered tetragonal LaReN  2  via a probable LaReN  2.5  intermediate, the first reported examples of nitride defect&#8208;perovskites. Magnetisation and conductivity measurements indicate that LaReN  3  and LaReN  2  are both metallic solids. The two chemical approaches presented here are expected to lead to new classes of ABN  3  and defect ABN  3&#8722;x  nitride perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to produce value&#8208;added chemicals has been intensively pursued. We report a series of CuxOyCz nanostruc&#173;tured electrocatalysts derived from a Cu&#8208;based MOF as porous self&#8208;sacrificial template. Blending catalysts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) suppressed the compete&#173;tive hydrogen evolution reaction. 25 to 50 wt% teflonized GDEs exhi&#173;bited a Faradaic efficiency of ~54% for C2+ products at &#8208;80 mA/cm2. The local OH&#8208; ions activity of PTFE&#8208;modified GDEs was assessed by means of closely positioning a Pt&#8208;nanoelectrode. A a substantial increase in the OH&#8208;/H2O activity ratio due to the locally generated OH&#8208; ions at increasing current densities was determined irrespective of the PTFE amount.</dc:description>

The local OH- ions activity of PTFE-modified GDEs was assessed by means of closely positioning a Pt-nanoelectrode. A a substantial increase in the OH-/H2O activity ratio due to the locally generated OH- ions at increasing current densities was determined irrespective of the PTFE amount.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Conductive Dy3+ phthalocyaninato complex single&#8208;molecule magnet, which exhibits slow magnetic relaxation, can be arranged in a 1D array by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. Hysteresis of the magnetoresistance of the 1D array derived from the &#960;&#8208;f interactions was observed at 2.2&#8197;K.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) arrangement of an unsubstituted partially oxidized Dy3+ double&#8208;decker complex, [DyPc2]Ix (Pc=phthalocyaninato, I=iodide; 1.93&lt;x&lt;2.26) (1), was obtained by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. In 1, the Pc ligands were partially oxidized, and I3&#8722; ion was present as a counter ion. From the results of spectrophotometric analysis on 1, the &#960; radicals were delocalized in a 1D column and behaved as a conductor even at low&#8208;temperatures. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects corresponding to a magnetic hysteresis of single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) were observed when the galvanomagnetic characteristics were investigated at 2.2&#8197;K.

         <title>Rational design of sustainable liquid microcapsules for spontaneous fragrance encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;Food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries rely on microencapsulation to grant the stability of products as well as protection and controlled release of active compounds. Concerning the fragrance technological sector, the high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. In this work, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis Activities in Lead&#8208;Free Cs2PtxSn1&#8208;xCl6 Perovskites via Ion Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have triggered appealing interests in the field of optoelectronics and photocatalysis due to their low toxicity, tunable optical and charge carrier properties. For the application point of view, it is desired to develop stable lead&#8208;free halide perovskites with multifunction. Herein, we successfully developed a series of Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with high stability, which show switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions by varying the amount of Pt  4+  substitution. The Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  solid solution with dominant proportion of Pt  4+  shows broadband photoluminescence with lifetime in microsecond&#8208;timescale. The Cs  2  Pt  x  Sn  1&#8208;x  Cl  6  solid solution with small amount of Pt  4+  substitution exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. Optical spectroscopy study reveals the switch between photoluminescence and photocatalysis function is controlled by sub&#8208;bandgap states. Our finding provides a new way to develop lead&#8208;free halide perovskites with multifunction and high stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Incorporated Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintaining for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of heteroatom is regarded as one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve the catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatom, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that a light element doping strategy, nitrogen incorporation, can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. As a comparison, we also confirm that the introduction of phosphorus (with a relatively large atomic radius) can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER. Our work put forward a new insight into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with highly symmetric crystal structure based on the doping strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>PNA&#8208;Guided Peptide Engineering of Aptamer Sensor for Protease&#8208;Unlocked Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protease&#8208;triggered control of functional DNA has remained unachieved, leaving a significant gap in activatable DNA biotechnology. Here we disclose the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer technology that can perform molecular sensing and imaging function in a tumor&#8208;specific manner. The system is constructed by locking structure&#8208;switching activity of aptamer using a rationally designed PNA&#8208;peptide&#8208;PNA triblock copolymer. Highly selective cleavage of the peptide substrate is achieved by protease&#8208;mediated enzymatic reaction that result in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequently recovering its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system not only allows for tumor cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging  in vitro  , but it also produce a fluorescent signal  in vivo  with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA field and peptide area for precise biomedical applications.</dc:description>

Highly selective cleavage of the peptide substrate is achieved by protease-mediated enzymatic reaction that result in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequently recovering its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system not only allows for tumor cell-selective ATP imaging  in vitro  , but it also produce a fluorescent signal  in vivo  with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA field and peptide area for precise biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique and bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by the reactions of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved by chiral HPLC at room temperature into enantiomers, which showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD spectra. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complex worked as an initiator for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions of Pd&#8208;TiO2 via In Situ TEM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely used in&#160;supported metal catalysts and extensive studies have been performed to understand the SMSI. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the surface structure of the support, as an important influencing factor, is usually ignored. Here, we report a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI of Pd&#8208;TiO  2  in oxygen by using in situ atmospheric pressure TEM. It is revealed that the Pd NPs supported on TiO  2  (101) and (100) surfaces showed encapsulation. In contrast, no such cover layer was observed in Pd&#8208;TiO  2  (001) catalyst under the same conditions. This facet&#8208;dependent SMSI, which originates from the different surface structure of the support, was demonstrated in a probe reaction of methane combustion catalyzed by Pd&#8208;TiO  2  . Our discovery of the oxidative facet&#8208;dependent SMSI gives direct evidence of the important role of the support surface structure in SMSI and provides a new way to tune the interaction between metal NPs and the support as well as catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysis with Supramolecular Carbon&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centres of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorized CoNi2S4 Yolk&#8208;Shell Spheres for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Production via Water and Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Herein, porous phosphorized CoNi  2  S  4  yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  YSSs) are rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni  3+  /Ni  2+  couple, enhanced electric conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8208;0.135 V, 1.512 V, and 1.306 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi  2  S  4  catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544 V in water splitting and 1.402 V in urea electrolysis to attain 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  with excellent durability for 100 h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work therefore not only promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production but also provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design and Crystal Structure of a Highly Efficient Benzoylecgonine Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine, and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity due to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption, representing a risk to our environment and non&#8208;target organisms. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE.  In vivo  , a single dose of BZEase2 (1 mg/kg, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme have the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE&#160; elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was determined, providing additional insights in support of our simulation results.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic denitrification is a promising technology for removing NOx species&#160; (NO3  &#8208;  , NO2  &#8208;  and NO). For NOx electroreduction (NOxRR), there is a desire for &#160;understanding the catalytic parameters that control the product distribution. Here, we elucidate selectivity and activity of catalyst for NOxRR. At low potential we classify metals by the binding of &#8194;NO versus &#8194;H. Analogous to classifying CO2 reduction by CO vs&#8194;H, Cu is able to bind&#8194;NO while not binding &#8194;H giving rise to a selective NH3 formation. Besides being selective, Cu is active for the reaction found by an activity&#8208;volcano. For metals that does not bind NO the reaction stops at NO, similar to CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. At potential above 0.3 V vs RHE, we speculate a low barrier for N coupling with NO causing N2O formation. The work provide a clear strategy for selectivity and aims to inspire future research on NOxRR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an experimental observation of  31  P NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000 ppm (meaning  percent  range, and a new record for solutions), and similar  1  H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [  t  Bu  (PNP)Fe&#8211;H], where PNP is a carbazole based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (  T  1  ~ 10  &#8208;11  s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Cancer Cells and Dictated Cytotoxicity Using Aptamer&#8208;Guided Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)&#8208;Generated G&#8208;Quadruplex Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the Zn(II)&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the Zn(II)PPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The Zn(II)PPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Darzens&#8208;type Epoxidation of Diazoesters: Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8208;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy  &#947;  &#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary  &#946;  &#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.</dc:description>

         <title>Template Guiding for Regioselective Fabrication of Uniformly Sub&#8208;nanometric Pt Clusters in beta&#8208;Zeolites with High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention due to their unique properties as homogeneous&#8208;like catalyst. However, it is a challenge to obtain the uniformly distributed metal cluster under harsh synthesis procedure and reaction condition. Herein, we report a middle&#8208;up protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, in which the precursors of metal ions are anchored in the internal of zeolite by template guidance through electrostatic interaction. The Pt metal clusters with the narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22 nm are obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with broad Si/Al molar ratio from 15 to 200. The strong interaction of Pt and zeolite in Pt@beta is effective to promote the spillover of active hydrogen, giving an excellent activity and stability for hydrodeoxygenation reaction. The proposed strategy provides a general strategy for the regioselective encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolite with high thermal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light,  I  R  &#8211; I  L  ,  when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  eCP&#8208;Raman  , a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by  eCP&#8208;Raman  , without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of  eCP&#8208;Raman  spectroscopy and for extracting  true  RROA experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Key Features of Polyimide&#8208;Derived Carbon Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have impressive separation properties; however, both chemical and morphology structures need to be understood better. Here we characterize CMS with the simplest polyimide (PI) PMDA/pPDA (PMDA=Pyromellitic Dianhydride, pPDA=  p  &#8208;Phenylenediamine), using FTIR, solid state  15  N&#8208;NMR,  13  C&#8208;NMR, XPS, XRD, and Raman spectra to study chemical structure. We also compare gas separation properties for this CMS to a CMS derived from a more conventional polyimide precursor. The detailed characterization shows the presence of aromatic pyridinic, pyrrolic rings as well as graphitic, pyridonic components and a few other groups in both CMS types derived from the very different precursors. The CMS morphologies, while related to precursor and pyrolysis temperature details, show similarities consistent with a physical picture comprising distributed molecular sieving plate&#8208;like structures. These results assist in understanding diverse CMS membrane separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;controllable Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation/ Hydroboration of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent addition reactions provide straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approaches to access different regioisomers. However, the regio&#8208;chemistry control to access all the possible results is still challenging especially for the reaction involving multiple addition steps. Herein, we reported regio&#8208;controllable cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylacetylenes, delivering all the possible regio&#8208;outcomes with high regioselectivities (up to &gt;20/1  rr  for all the cases). Each regioisomer of value&#8208;added silylboronates could be efficiently and regioselectively obtained from the same materials. The adjustment of the ligands of cobalt catalysts combined with dual catalysis relay strategy is the key to achieve regio&#8208;chemistry control. This regio&#8208;controllable research might inspire the exploration of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis that involve multiple additions and provide full sets of regioisomers of other synthetic useful molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Quick and Easy Method for Dramatic Improvement of the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO  2  reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO  2  reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7,300,000 s  &#8211;1  , which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated Fe(I) species and CO  2  in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Organic Co&#8208;crystals Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and  intriguing  properties, such as room temperature ferroelectricity and two&#8208;photon absorption ability. However, the supramolecular interactions of co&#8208;crystals restrict their stability in the aqueous solution phase, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we reported on the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application of self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca  2+  as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8208;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47 &#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be enhanced and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy. This conceptual work demonstrates the feasibility of using organic co&#8208;crystals in aqueous solution and should pave the way to a wide variety of photonic and biophotonic applications via such new platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Squalene&#8208;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis so far, however, has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (  S  )&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids such as (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone, an SHC wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC from&#160;  Acidothermus cellulolyticus  &#160;(  Aci  SHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of the desired monocyclic (  R  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (  E/Z  )&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased by two orders of magnitude&#160;to 79%.&#160;Notably, analyzed&#160;  Aci  SHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the  Z  &#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (  R  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99%&#160;  ee  ), the&#160;  E  &#8208;isomer was converted to the (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95%&#160;  ee  ). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9%&#160;  ee  ) could be obtained through substrate engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as antibacterial and antibiofilm agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks (DCFs) were synthesized and screened for biofilm inhibition or disruption. They are composed of a trialdehyde core reversibly linked to a diamine PEG connector and to a variety of neutral, anionic or cationic heads, to generate a library of DCFs to generate multivalent dendritic architectures in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The best DCFs were always polycationic and the nature of the cationic heads significantly impact the antibiofilm activity. The best antibiofilm activity was observed for DCF3B, displaying a polyethyleneimine head. Interestingly, a simple inactive guanidinium functional head, strongly inhibited biofilm growth when assayed as a multivalent DCF3C. Using a more advanced in vitro bio&#64257;lm model of chronic wound infection, DCF3C was found significantly superior than all other DCFs. These results demonstrate 1) the versatility and effectiveness of DCFs as low cost and efficient systems for antibiofilm disruption 2) the efficiency of dynamic chemistry as a discovery technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is an important process in light olefin industry; however,  the  over&#8208;oxidation  of ethane  leads to low ethylene selectivity. Here, we report a novel approach to electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in anode in conjunction with CO  2  reduction at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser using a porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO  2  electrode at 600&#176;C. We identify and engineer the flux and chemical states of active oxygen species that evolve from the lattice at anode surface in order to activate and dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene  via  the reaction of epoxy species. Active oxygen species (O  2  &#8722;  , O  2  2  &#8722;  and O  2  &#8722;  ) at the anode surface effectively dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, but O  &#8722;  species tend to induce deep oxidation. We demonstrate exceptionally high ethylene selectivity of 95% and an ethane conversion of 10% with a durable operation of 300 h.</dc:description>

         <title>A Congruent&#8208;Melting Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are vital for the development of photonics research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art laser technology, but the study of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient dij and laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), as well as the harsh synthetic conditions that are usually needed. Herein, we report the facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs4V8O22 (CVO) featuring a quasi&#8208;rigid honeycomb&#8208;layered structure with [VO4] and [VO5] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR&#8208;transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent&#8208;melting behavior.&#160;In particular, it displays very strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG intensities in the metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064 nm and 2.2 &#215; AgGaS2 @ 2100 nm). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within the [V4O11]&#8734; layer, and that the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure. These attributes suggest that CVO is an outstanding mid&#8208;IR NLO candidate material.</dc:description>

         <title>Feedback and Communication in Active Hydrogel Spheres with pH Fronts: Facile Approaches to Grow Soft Hydrogel Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Signal gating, communication, memory, and pattern formation are central to living systems, which operate under energy consuming, feedback&#8208;driven reaction networks. Programming systems realizing these phenomena will provide increasingly life&#8208;like materials with new emerging functions. Moving towards this, we compartmentalized urea&#8208;urease and more complex urea&#8208;urease/ester&#8208;esterase pH&#8208;feedback reaction networks into alginate hydrogel spheres and investigate how fuel&#8208;driven pH fronts can be sent out from these spheres and regulated by internal reaction networks. Further, we install membrane characteristic by covering urea&#8208;urease spheres with responsive hydrogel shells. In a systems chemistry approach, we then encapsulate the two antagonistic networks (urea&#8208;urease and ester&#8208;esterase) separately into different hydrogel spheres to devise communication, pattern formation, and attraction. We showcase that these pH fronts and pH front patterns can be used to localize peptide&#8208;based fibrillar hydrogels and can be used to develop complex geometric gel structures without 3D printing tools and for hydrogels that fail to be printable using classical extrusion printing. This study bridges systems chemistry and materials science aspects and opens a new scope for feedback&#8208;controlled compartmentalized reaction networks in developing smart, adaptive soft materials of non&#8208;injectable supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitride Supported&#160;High&#8208;Loading Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Activating of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2&#160;with 100% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of  1O2. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atoms catalyst (Fe1/CN) containing highly uniform Fe&#8208;N4  active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2 wt%. The Fe1/CN achieves generation of 100%  1O2  by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single&#8208;atom sites, the Fe&#8208;N4  sites in Fe1/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO5&#8226;&#8208;, and thereafter efficiently generate  1O2  with 100% selectivity. In addition, the Fe1/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS. This work develops a novel catalyst for the 100% selective production of  1O2  for highly selective and efficient degradation of pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to methanol via atomically dispersed Sn coupled with defective CuO catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using renewable electricity to drive CO  2  electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO  2  reduction. Currently, CO  2  electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6% with a current density of 67.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO  2  adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO  2  activation  via  decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum&#160;in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /CeO  2  catalyst by atom trapping (AT, 800  o  C in air) shows excellent thermal stability, however, it is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures due to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt  2+  in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt  1  O  4  coordination. Reductive activation forming Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity, however, NPs are easily oxidized leading to drastic activity loss. Here we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt  2+  via thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt  1  /CeO  2  catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt; 1200  o  C) in an inert atmosphere induce surface reconstruction of CeO  2  , generating Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt  1  O  4  configuration. Originating from this unique coordination, Pt  1  &#948;+  in a partially reduced state dynamically evolved during CO oxidation, resulting in an exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. The CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt  1  /CeO  2  _TS catalyst is retained under oxidizing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A New and Efficient Diazirine Based Four&#8208;armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photo&#8208;patterning method is critical for all&#8208;solution fabrication of integrated electronic devices based on organic/polymeric semiconductors. In this paper, we report a new diazirine based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (  4CNN  ) with a tetrahedron geometry for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion reaction. After blending of  4  CNN  with no more than 3% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of  p  &#8208;,  n  &#8208; and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was successfully achieved, and regular patterns with size as small as 5 &#181;m were prepared easily with the aid of appropriate photomasks after UV (365 nm) light irradiation for just 40 s. Remarkably, the interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking. As a consequence, the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. By taking the advantage of the fact that the cross&#8208;linked thin films are robust and show good resistance to organic solvents, a complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the  p  &#8208;type and  n  &#8208;type semiconducting polymers. These results demonstrate that  4CNN  is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors, and hold great potentials for all&#8208;solution processible flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine  N  &#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and  N&#8208;  triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed  sp  2  &#8208;  sp  3  cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Hydrogen Bonding of B3N6&#8208;[4]Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8211;B&#8211;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B  3  N  6  &#8208;[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC  4  N). A  tert  &#8208;butylated B  3  N  6  &#8208;[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three&#8208;fold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;&#8208;electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8211;B&#8211;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, which forms H&#8208;bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD&#8208;AA hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays with 2,7&#8208;di(  tert  &#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone in the co&#8208;crystal. Moreover, the blue fluorescence of B  3  N  6  &#8208;[4]triangulene in solution is responsive to binding  p  &#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Kind of RIV&#8208;type AIEgens and Their Applications for the Construction of Multifunctional Luminescent MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a new kind of butterfly&#8208;like molecules of oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine (OAP) are reported, which exhibit typical characteristics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. Unlike any of the reported RIV&#8208;type AIE molecules, the synthetic procedures of which are complicated and associated high costs,  OAP  AIEgens can be synthesized in a facile manner by a one&#8208;step catalyst&#8208;free reaction using commercially available materials. Notably,  OAP  AIEgens are ideal ligands for constructing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their built&#8208;in coordination sites of pyrazine groups.  OAP&#8208;based MOFs exhibit multiple potential applications in reversible gas response, encrypted information storage, and construction of white light&#8208;emitting devices. This work enriches limited kinds of RIV&#8208;type AIEgens, offers additional selections of bridging ligands for constructing luminescent MOFs and provides a visualized prototype to understand the effect of RIV process on the luminescence property of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mild Intermolecular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Incorporated Tricyclic Skeleton: Unusual Reactivity of Isobenzopyryliums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes embedded in a polycyclic bridged architecture are a versatile structural motif, but such complex frameworks often impose substantial synthetic challenges. Herein we introduce a new approach for the expedient access to such spring&#8208;loaded strained systems via an exceptionally mild intermolecular convergent process between the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinylboronic acids. Different from the typical conventional approaches, our protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions in order to overcome the disfavored kinetic and thermodynamic problems. Instead, the key cyclopropane ring was formed between the well&#8208;positioned nucleophile and electrophile in the adduct from the regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition. Thus, this unusual process also represents a new reactivity of the versatile isobenzopyryliums. The choice of a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst with proper acidity is crucial to the high efficiency and selectivity for this multiple bond&#8208;forming process. The strained products are precursors to other useful synthetic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it&#8217;s still a great challenge to develop heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8208;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct detection of surface species formed on iridium electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. In this study, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8208;3&#160;nm of (024), (026), (113) and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8208;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick sub&#8208;surface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8208;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8208;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Activated Latent Heteroaromatic Sulfinates as Nucleophilic Coupling Partners in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl halides.&#160;However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to&#160;purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi&#8208;step transformations.&#160;Here we introduce base&#8208;activated, latent sulfinate reagents;&#160;&#946;&#8208;nitrile and &#946;&#8208;ester sulfones. We show that under the cross&#8208;coupling conditions, these species eliminate to generate the sulfinate salt&#160;in situ, which then undergoes efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi&#8208;step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale&#8208;up.</dc:description>

         <title>Radically Enhanced Dual Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexation between a viologen radical cation (  V  &#8226;+  ) and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylene) diradical dication (  CBPQT  2(&#8226;+)  ) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of two  V  &#8226;+  &#160;using radical&#8208;pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (  MV  &#8226;+  ) in a size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host&#8212;namely, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalene)  2(&#8226;+)  , i.e.,  CBPQN  2(&#8226;+)  . Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cationic units&#160;in  CBPQN  2(&#8226;+)  suitable for binding two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;with relatively short (3.05&#8211;3.25 &#197;) radical&#8208;pairing distances. The radical host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association&#160;with the two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex&#8212;namely, [  (MV)  2  &#8834;  CBPQN]  4(&#8226;+  )  &#8212;in MeCN was confirmed by VT&#160;  1  H NMR, as well as by EPR, spectroscopy. The solid&#8208;state superstructure of [  (MV)  2  &#8834;  CBPQN]  4(&#8226;+  )  reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05 &#197;) between the three different  V  &#8226;+  , suggesting that localization of the radical&#8208;pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;inside the radical host.&#160;Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host&#8208;guest radical&#8208;pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox&#8208;switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol&#8208; and Phenyl&#8208;Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyphenol&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has attracted interest for engineering a range of functional surface coatings. Herein, we report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412 kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional &#8226;OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives (from small molecules to biological macromolecules containing phenol groups) and different metal ions including Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), and Co(II). In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. Importantly, the properties (e.g., radical scavenging and antibacterial activity) of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for the surface engineering of diverse materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+  chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).</dc:description>

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na  2  WO  4  /SiO  2  catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of  in&#8208;situ  Raman and chemical probe (H  2  &#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na  2  WO  4  active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable dispersed surface Na&#8208;WO  x  sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (  i  ) surface Na&#8208;WO  x  sites are responsible for selectively activating CH  4  to C  2  H  x  and over&#8208;oxidizing CH  y  to CO and (  ii  ) molten Na  2  WO  4  phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH  4  to CO  2  and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C  2  H  6  to C  2  H  4  . These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na  2  WO  4  /SiO  2  catalysts.</dc:description>
