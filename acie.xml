         <title>Organic&#8208;Platinum Hybrids for Covalent Binding of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Structural Basis and Application to Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been revived as promising therapeutic targets with the development of immunotherapy, but the G4&#8208;mediated immune response remains unclear. We designed a novel class of G4&#8208;binding organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, with spatial matching for G4 binding and G4 DNA reactivity for binding site locking. The solution structure of L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;MYT1L G4 demonstrated the effectiveness of the covalent binding and revealed the covalent binding&#8208;guided dynamic balance, accompanied by the destruction of the A5&#8208;T17 base pairs to achieve the covalent binding of the platinum unit to N7 of the G6 residue. Furthermore, L1&#8208;cispt&#8208; and L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;mediated genomic dysfunction could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). The use of L1&#8208;cispt/L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;treated dying cells as therapeutic vaccines stimulated a robust immune response and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent locking in G4&#8208;trageting drug design and their potential in immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Charge Transfer from Organic Ligands to Metal Halides in Zero&#8208;Dimensional [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 Enabled by Pressure&#8208;Induced Lone Pair&#8208;&#960;&#160;Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional (low&#8208;D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have emerged as fascinating candidates for optoelectronics due to their integrated properties from both organic and inorganic components. However, for most of low&#8208;D OMHHs, especially the zero&#8208;D (0D) compounds, the inferior electronic coupling between organic ligands and inorganic metal halides prevents efficient charge transfer at the hybrid interfaces and thus limits their further tunability of optical and electronic properties. Here, using pressure to regulate the interfacial interactions, efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides is achieved, which leads to a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at around 6.0 GPa in a 0D OMHH, [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene ring (lp&#8208;&#960; interaction) serves as an unexpected "bridge" for the charge transfer. Our work opens a versatile strategy for the new materials design by manipulating the lp&#8208;&#960; interactions in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Sodium Thioborate Fast Ion Conductor: Na3B5S9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3B5S9 is the first sodium thioborate fast ion conductor, exhibiting high total ionic conductivity of 0.80&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (sintered pellet). The corner&#8208;sharing B10S20 supertetrahedral clusters create 3D diffusion channels housing Na&#8208;ions that are well&#8208;distributed over five crystallographic sites. Solid state NMR and AIMD simulations further demonstrate fast Na&#8208;ion diffusion within the channels.







Abstract
We report a new sodium fast&#8208;ion conductor, Na3B5S9, that exhibits a high Na ion total conductivity of 0.80&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (sintered pellet; cold&#8208;pressed pellet=0.21&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The structure consists of corner&#8208;sharing B10S20 supertetrahedral clusters, which create a framework that supports 3D Na ion diffusion channels. The Na ions are well&#8208;distributed in the channels and form a disordered sublattice spanning five Na crystallographic sites. The combination of structural elucidation via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and powder synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at variable temperatures, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal high Na&#8208;ion mobility (predicted conductivity: 0.96&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and the nature of the 3D diffusion pathways. Notably, the Na ion sublattice orders at low temperatures, resulting in isolated Na polyhedra and thus much lower ionic conductivity. This highlights the importance of a disordered Na ion sublattice&#8212;and existence of well&#8208;connected Na ion migration pathways formed via face&#8208;sharing polyhedra&#8212;in dictating Na ion diffusion.

         <title>Coronaviruses Use ACE2 Monomers as Entry&#8208;Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
dSTORM imaging shows that the entry&#8208;receptor ACE2 of coronaviruses is homogeneously distributed in the plasma membrane of host cells with expression levels of only 1&#8211;2 ACE2 molecules&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2. In contrast to previous reports that suggested binding of multiple spikes per virus to ACE2 homodimers or oligomers our data reveal that ACE2 is expressed as monomer in the plasma membrane in the absence and presence of trimeric spike proteins.







Abstract
The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as entry receptor on cells enabling binding and infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) via trimeric spike (S) proteins protruding from the viral surface. It has been suggested that trimeric S proteins preferably bind to plasma membrane areas with high concentrations of possibly multimeric ACE2 receptors to achieve a higher binding and infection efficiency. Here we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in combination with different labeling approaches to visualize the distribution and quantify the expression of ACE2 on different cells. Our results reveal that endogenous ACE2 receptors are present as monomers in the plasma membrane with densities of only 1&#8211;2 receptors &#956;m&#8722;2. In addition, binding of trimeric S proteins does not induce the formation of ACE2 oligomers in the plasma membrane. Supported by infection studies using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing S proteins our data demonstrate that a single S protein interaction per virus particle with a monomeric ACE2 receptor is sufficient for infection, which provides SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 a high infectivity.

         <title>Evolutionary Algorithm Directed Synthesis of Mixed Anion Compounds LaF2X (X=Br, I) and LaFI2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the evolutionary algorithm directed synthesis of mixed&#8208;anion compounds with LaF2X and LaFX2 (X=Br, I). The new structures share the structural features of the end phases LaF3 and LaI3, but with heteroleptic coordination environments around La, which could be beneficial for fluoride ion conductivity as shown theoretically.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion compounds have attracted growing attentions, but their synthesis is challenging, making a rational search desirable. Here, we explored LaF3&#8208;LaX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) system using ab initio structure searches based on evolutionary algorithms, and predicted LaF2X and LaFX2 (X=Br, I), which are respectively isostructural with LaHBr2 and YH2I, consisting of layered La&#8208;F blocks with single and double ordered honeycomb lattices, separated by van der Waals gaps. We successfully synthesized these compounds: LaF2Br and LaFI2 crystallize in the predicted structure, while LaF2I is similar to the predicted one but with different layer stacking. LaF2I exhibits fluoride ion conductivity comparable to that of non&#8208;doped LaF3, and has the potential to show better ionic conductivity upon appropriate doping, given the theoretically lower diffusion energy barrier and the presence of soft iodine anions. This study shows the structure prediction using evolutionary algorithms will accelerate the discovery of mixed&#8208;anion compounds in future, in particular those with an ordered anion arrangement.

         <title>Photocatalytic 2&#8208;Iodoethanol Coupling to Produce 1,4&#8208;Butanediol Mediated by TiO2 and a Catalytic Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic 2&#8208;iodoethanol (IEO) reductive coupling to 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) over semiconductors is kinetically slow and shows low selectivity because of the negative reduction potential of IEO and competitive side reactions of the &#946;HE radical intermediate. A molecular Ni catalyst rapidly extracts electrons from TiO2 and thereby promotes photocatalytic reduction of IEO selectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic 2&#8208;iodoethanol (IEO) coupling provides 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) of particular interest to produce degradable polyesters. However, the reduction potential of IEO is too negative (&#8722;1.9 vs NHE) to be satisfied by most of the semiconductors, and the kinetics of transferring one electron for IEO coupling is slow. Here we design a catalytic Ni complex, which works synergistically with TiO2, realizing reductive coupling of IEO powered by photo&#8208;energy. Coordinating by terpyridine stabilizes Ni2+ from being photo&#8208;deposited to TiO2, thereby retaining the steric configuration beneficial for IEO coupling. The Ni complex can rapidly extract electrons from TiO2, generating a low&#8208;valent Ni capable of reducing IEO. The photocatalytic IEO coupling thus provides BDO in 72&#8201;% selectivity. By a stepwise procedure, BDO is obtained with 70&#8201;% selectivity from ethylene glycol. This work put forward a strategy for the photocatalytic reduction of molecules requiring strong negative potential.

         <title>Resolving the Heat Generated from ZrO2 Atomic Layer Deposition Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ pyroelectric calorimetry was used to investigate the saturating surface reactions for tetrakis(dimethylamino)zirconium(IV) (TDMAZr) and water. Time&#8208;resolved measurements of heat generation provide both kinetic and thermodynamic information. These results were compared to calculated enthalpies from DFT models to better understand proposed mechanisms for these atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactions.







Abstract
In situ pyroelectric calorimetry and spectroscopic ellipsometry were used to investigate surface reactions in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium oxide (ZrO2). Calibrated and time&#8208;resolved in situ ALD calorimetry provides new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of saturating surface reactions for tetrakis(dimethylamino)zirconium(IV) (TDMAZr) and water. The net ALD reaction heat ranged from 0.197&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 76&#8201;&#176;C to 0.155&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 158&#8201;&#176;C, corresponding to an average of 4.0&#8197;eV/Zr at all temperatures. A temperature dependence for reaction kinetics was not resolved over the range investigated. The temperature dependence of net reaction heat and distribution among metalorganic and oxygen source exposure is attributed to factors including growth rate, equilibrium surface hydroxylation, and the extent of the reaction. ZrO2&#8208;forming surface reactions were investigated computationally using DFT methods to better understand the influence of surface hydration on reaction thermodynamics.

         <title>Unveiling the CO Oxidation Mechanism over a Molecularly Defined Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic CO oxidation is described over a structurally well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom catalyst with isolated Cu ions supported on a UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework with missing linkers. The reaction pathway, intermediates and transition states were elucidated. A number of different experimental and calculated catalyst properties were compared at the different stages of the reaction.







Abstract
Elucidating the reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis is critically important for catalyst development, yet remains challenging because of the often unclear nature of the active sites. Using a molecularly defined copper single&#8208;atom catalyst supported by a UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu/UiO&#8208;66) allows a detailed mechanistic elucidation of the CO oxidation reaction. Based on a combination of in situ/operando spectroscopies, kinetic measurements including kinetic isotope effects, and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory&#8208;based calculations, we identified the active site, reaction intermediates, and transition states of the dominant reaction cycle as well as the changes in oxidation/spin state during reaction. The reaction involves the continuous reactive dissociation of adsorbed O2, by reaction of O2,ad with COad, leading to the formation of an O atom connecting the Cu center with a neighboring Zr4+ ion as the rate limiting step. This is removed in a second activated step.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>

An insoluble alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline framework (Alkynyl&#8208;CPF) is designed, the electronic structure of which can be tuned through the high degree of electron conjugation along alkynyl units and aromatic rings. The Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries demonstrates large reversible capacities and long cycle life.







Abstract
The poor conductivity of the pristine bulk covalent organic material is the main challenge for its application in energy storage. The mechanism of symmetric alkynyl bonds (C&#8801;C) in covalent organic materials for lithium storage is still rarely reported. Herein, a nanosized (&#8776;80&#8197;nm) alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline framework (Alkynyl&#8208;CPF) is synthesized for the first time to improve the intrinsic charge conductivity and the insolubility of the covalent organic material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Because of the high degree of electron conjugation along alkynyl units and N atoms from phenanthroline groups, the Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrodes with the lowest HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap (&#916;E=2.629&#8197;eV) show improved intrinsic conductivity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the pristine Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode delivers superior cycling performance with a large reversible capacity and outstanding rate properties (1068.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 410.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 700&#8197;cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, by Raman, FT&#8208;IR, XPS, EIS, and theoretical simulations, the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of C&#8801;C units and phenanthroline groups in the Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode has been investigated. This work provides new strategies and insights for the design and mechanism investigation of covalent organic materials in electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Ordered and Fast Ion Transport of Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Electrolyte with Regulated Coordination Strength for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>

By regulating the coordination strength of Li+ on the functional groups of a 3D network polymer and liquid solvent, the ionic conductivity of the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte can approach that of liquid electrolytes in lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymer based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSE) has attracted great attention due to its assurance for high safety of rechargeable batteries including lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, it faces the issue of low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer between QSE and lithium anode. Herein, we firstly demonstrate that the ordered and fast transport of lithium ion (Li+) can be realized in QSE. Due to the higher coordination strength of Li+ on tertiary amine (&#8722;NR3) group of polymer network than that on carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of ester solvent, Li+ can diffuse orderly and quickly on &#8722;NR3 of polymer, significantly increasing the ionic conductivity of QSE to 3.69&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, &#8722;NR3 of polymer can induce in situ and uniform generation of Li3N and LiNxOy in SEI. As a result, the Li||NCM811 batteries (50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil) with this QSE show an excellent stability of 220&#8197;cycles at &#8776;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 5 times to those with conventional QSE. LMBs with LiFePO4 can stably run for &#8776;8300&#8197;h. This work demonstrates an attractive concept for improving ionic conductivity of QSE, and also provides an important step for developing advanced LMB with high cycle stability and safety.

         <title>Reactive Superhydrophobic Surfaces for Interlayer Electrical Connectivity in Three&#8208;dimensional Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous polymer film with amine reactivity and inherent superhydrophobicity (RSH film) is developed for effortless coating onto a variety of substrates and further amine functionalizations. Significantly, this photopatterned and insulated film enables the in situ generation of PEDOT vertical circuits, providing a novel means to create interlayer electrical connectivity with anti&#8208;fouling property and air&#8208;permeability for 3D electronic devices.







Abstract
This study describes the development of a new type of amine&#8208;reactive superhydrophobic (RSH) film that is facilely coated on various substrates using a single&#8208;step process, while the versatility of this RSH film offers a reliable solution for efficient formation of complex and robust interlayer electrical connectivity (IEC) in 3D electronic systems. The excellent spatial controllability of surface amine modification enables the generation of vertical circuits in situ, providing a distinct way to connect circuits located on different layers. Moreover, the inherent superhydrophobicity and porosity exhibit the required anti&#8208;fouling and breathability properties, making the RSH&#8208;based IEC well&#8208;suited for applications where exposure to environmental gas and liquid contaminants is likely. This approach provides another avenue towards the development of IEC in 3D flexible integrated electronics, opening up new possibilities for the advancement of this field.

         <title>Building Blocks and COFs Formed in Concert&#8212;Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacene Covalent Organic Framework in the Bulk and as Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant limitations exist in the synthesis of highly ordered structures including the solubility, shape, and packing of building blocks. A three&#8208;component synthesis allows for the preparation of novel pyrene&#8208;fused azaacene covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in a one&#8208;step reaction. The COFs can also be prepared as films, and the optical properties of the materials are studied.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component synthesis methodology is described for the formation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing extended aromatics. Notably, this approach enables synthesis of the building blocks and COF along parallel reaction landscapes, on a similar timeframe. The use of fragmental building block components, namely pyrene dione diboronic acid as aggregation&#8208;inducing COF precursor and the diamines o&#8208;phenylenediamine (Ph), 2,3&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (Naph), or (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (2Ph) as extending functionalization units in conjunction with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene, resulted in the formation of the corresponding pyrene&#8208;fused azaacene, i.e., Aza&#8208;COF series with full conversion of the dione moiety, long&#8208;range order, and high surface area. In addition, the novel three&#8208;component synthesis was successfully applied to produce highly crystalline, oriented thin films of the Aza&#8208;COFs with nanostructured surfaces on various substrates. The Aza&#8208;COFs exhibit light absorption maxima in the blue spectral region, and each Aza&#8208;COF presents a distinct photoluminescence profile. Transient absorption measurements of Aza&#8208;Ph&#8208; and Aza&#8208;Naph&#8208;COFs suggest ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited&#8208;states within these COFs.

         <title>Single Atom Bi Decorated Copper Alloy Enables C&#8722;C Coupling for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 into C2+ Products
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single atom Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) was prepared for the first time to enable the C&#8722;C coupling, resulting in selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products with faraday efficiency of ca. 73&#8201;%.







Abstract
Single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have been recently explored for promotion of various heterogeneous catalysis, but it remains unexplored for selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products involving C&#8722;C coupling. Herein we report a single&#8208;atomic Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) electrocatalyst that could effectively modulate selectivity of CO2 reduction into C2+ products instead of previous C1 ones. The BiCu&#8208;SAA catalyst exhibits remarkably superior selectivity of C2+ products with optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.4&#8201;% compared to the pure copper nanoparticle or Bi nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Cu nanocomposites, and its structure and performance can be well maintained at current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the flow cell system. Based on our in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the BiCu&#8208;SAA is found to favor the activation of CO2 and subsequent C&#8722;C coupling during the electrocatalytic reaction, as should be responsible for its extraordinary C2+ selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The single atom Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu-SAA) was prepared for the first time to enable the C&#8722;C coupling, resulting in selective electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products with faraday efficiency of ca. 73&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have been recently explored for promotion of various heterogeneous catalysis, but it remains unexplored for selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products involving C&#8722;C coupling. Herein we report a single-atomic Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu-SAA) electrocatalyst that could effectively modulate selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products instead of previous C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ones. The BiCu-SAA catalyst exhibits remarkably superior selectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products with optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.4&#8201;% compared to the pure copper nanoparticle or Bi nanoparticles-decorated Cu nanocomposites, and its structure and performance can be well maintained at current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under the flow cell system. Based on our in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the BiCu-SAA is found to favor the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and subsequent C&#8722;C coupling during the electrocatalytic reaction, as should be responsible for its extraordinary C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rotaxane Synthesis by an End&#8208;Capping Strategy via Swelling Axle&#8208;Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enlargement of the size of the terminal phenol group of the axle component by aromatic bromination was found effective for rotaxane synthesis. The 19 examples given, including the formation of a [3]rotaxane, illustrate the broad scope of the approach as well as the possible degradative release of the axle component by dethreading of the thermally stable brominated rotaxanes under the basic conditions.







Abstract
A method for rotaxane synthesis by enlargement of the size of the terminal phenol group of the axle component by aromatic bromination has been developed. This method may be regarded as an end&#8208;capping strategy involving the swelling of the phenol group at the axle terminal. The advantages of the present strategy include: ready availability of axle components with a variety of swelling precursors, wide product scope (19 examples given including a [3]rotaxane), mild conditions for the swelling process, rich potential for the derivatization of the brominated rotaxanes, and possible release of the axle component by degradative dethreading of the thermally stable brominated rotaxanes under the basic conditions.

         <title>Tuning Local Charge Distribution in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported to regulate local charge distributions and intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions in multivariate covalent organic frameworks (COFs). By fine&#8208;tuning the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions, a COF with a record&#8208;high uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02&#8197;mg/g/day in natural seawater under visible light was realized.







Abstract
Optimizing the electronic structure of covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts is essential for maximizing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report an isoreticular family of multivariate COFs containing chromenoquinoline rings in the COF structure and electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups in the pores. Intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions in the COFs allowed tuning of local charge distributions and charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. By optimizing the optoelectronic properties of the COFs, a photocatalytic uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02&#8197;mg/g/day was achieved using a nitro&#8208;functionalized multicomponent COF in natural seawater, exceeding the performance of all COFs reported to date. Results demonstrate an effective design strategy towards high&#8208;activity COF photocatalysts with intramolecular D&#8208;A structures not easily accessible using traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Construction of Co4 Atomic Clusters to Enable Fe&#8722;N4 Motifs with Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing metal atomic clusters can effectively boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance and stability of Fe&#8722;N4 on the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) substrate. The Co4@/Fe1@NC catalyst is realized through a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained&#8221; strategy using Co4 molecular clusters and Fe(acac)3 implanted carbon precursors and the obtained catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N4 configurations are highly needed owing to the high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the limited intrinsic activity and dissatisfactory durability have significantly restrained the practical application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Here, we demonstrate that constructing adjacent metal atomic clusters (ACs) is effective in boosting the ORR performance and stability of Fe&#8722;N4 catalysts. The integration of Fe&#8722;N4 configurations with highly uniform Co4 ACs on the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Co4@/Fe1@NC) is realized through a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained&#8221; strategy using Co4 molecular clusters and Fe(acac)3 implanted carbon precursors. The as&#8208;developed Co4@/Fe1@NC catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.835&#8197;V vs. RHE in acidic media and a high peak power density of 840&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell test. First&#8208;principles calculations further clarify the ORR catalytic mechanism on the identified Fe&#8722;N4 that modified with Co4 ACs. This work provides a viable strategy for precisely establishing atomically dispersed polymetallic centers catalysts for efficient energy&#8208;related catalysis.

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Encapsulating Lithium Polysulfide Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox comediation strategy is proposed for promoting the cathode redox kinetics and simultaneously retaining the anode protection capability of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries using encapsulating lithium polysulfide electrolyte. A 1.5&#8197;Ah lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell realizes a high initial energy density of 359&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 37 stable cycles following the above strategy.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are regarded as promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries is restricted by the parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating LiPS electrolyte (EPSE) can efficiently suppress the parasitic reactions but inevitably sacrifices the cathode sulfur redox kinetics. To address the above dilemma, a redox comediation strategy for EPSE is proposed to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries. Concretely, dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe) is employed as an efficient redox comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics in Li&#8211;S batteries with EPSE. DMDSe enhances the liquid&#8211;liquid and liquid&#8211;solid conversion kinetics of LiPS in EPSE while maintains the ability to alleviate the anode parasitic reactions from LiPSs. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S pouch cell with a high energy density of 359&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at cell level and stable 37&#8197;cycles is realized. This work provides an effective redox comediation strategy for EPSE to simultaneously achieve high energy density and long cycling stability in Li&#8211;S batteries and inspires rational integration of multi&#8208;strategies for practical working batteries.

This work provides an effective redox comediation strategy for EPSE to simultaneously achieve high energy density and long cycling stability in Li&#8211;S batteries and inspires rational integration of multi-strategies for practical working batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Lanthanide Nanocomposites for Customized Synergistic Treatment of Orthotopic Multi&#8208;Tumor Cases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a multichannel lanthanide&#8208;based nanocomposite, the tumor ablation efficiency can be predicted through fluorescence imaging for customized synergistic ablation of multiple orthotopic breast tumors simultaneously under a non&#8208;uniform light field. With a customized irradiation prescription, it shows better therapeutic efficiency and recovery rate than traditional therapeutic methods.







Abstract
Simultaneous photothermal ablation of multiple tumors is limited by unpredictable photo&#8208;induced apoptosis, caused by individual intratumoral differences. Here, a multi&#8208;channel lanthanide nanocomposite was used to achieve tailored synergistic treatment of multiple subcutaneous orthotopic tumors under non&#8208;uniform whole&#8208;body infrared irradiation prescription. The nanocomposite reduces intratumoral glutathione by simultaneously activating the fluorescence and photothermal channels. The fluorescence provides individual information on different tumors, allowing customized prescriptions to be made. This enables optimal induction of hyperthermia and dosage of chemo drugs, to ensure treatment efficacy, while avoiding overtherapy. With an accessional therapeutic laser system, customized synergistic treatment of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer cases with multiple tumors is possible with both high efficacy and minimized side effects.

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Amphiphilic Poly(ferrocenes) for Synergistic Amplification of Oxidative Stress in Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;immolative amphiphilic poly(ferrocenes) are fabricated with self&#8208;immolative backbone, aminoferrocene (AFc) side chains, and end&#8208;capping poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether. Upon acidic milieu&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail degradation, rational GSH depletion and reactive oxygen species burst is observed to amplify the oxidative stress for efficient tumor inhibition. This work provides a promising drug&#8208;free polymer strategy for precision medicine.







Abstract
Amphiphilic self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) can achieve complete degradation solely through one triggerable event, which potentially optimize the blood clearance and uncontrollable/inert degradability for therapeutic nanoparticles. Herein, we report self&#8208;immolative amphiphilic poly(ferrocenes), BPnbs&#8208;Fc, composed by self&#8208;immolative backbone and aminoferrocene (AFc) side chains as well as end&#8208;capping poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether. Upon triggering by tumor acidic milieu, the BPnbs&#8208;Fc nanoparticles readily degrade to release azaquinone methide (AQM) moieties, which can rapidly deplete intracellular glutathione (GSH) to cascade release AFc. Furthermore, both AFc and its product Fe2+ can catalyze intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), thus amplifying the oxidative stress of tumor cells. Rational synergy of GSH depletion and &#8901;OH burst can efficiently inhibit tumor growth by the SIPs in vitro and in vivo. This work provides an elegant design to adopt innate tumor milieu&#8208;triggerable SIPs degradation to boost cellular oxidative stress, which is a promising candidate for precision medicine.

         <title>Increased Nitrogenase Activity in Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrids Containing Non&#8208;photosynthetic Bacteria and Conducting Polymers</title>

The cationic conjugated poly(fluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;phenylene) derivative (PFP) and non&#8208;photosynthetic nitrogen&#8208;fixing Azotobacter Chroococcum (A.&#8197;Chroococcum) were first combined to create a new light&#8208;driven and self&#8208;assembled biohybrid system. PFP possesses excellent light harvesting ability and transfers electrons into redox proteins in A.&#8197;Chroococcum, promoting the nitrogen fixation pathway in situ under illumination.







Abstract
A conductive polymer&#8208;based photosynthetic biohybrid is constructed to enhance biological nitrogen fixation by increasing nitrogenase activity in the non&#8208;photosynthetic bacterium Azotobacter Chroococcum (A.&#8197;Chroococcum). The light&#8208;harvesting cationic poly(fluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;phenylene) (PFP) electrostatically binds to the surface of the bacteria and possesses satisfactory conductivity to facilitate electron transfer to the bacterium, promoting the nitrogen fixation pathway through redox proteins on the surface of the bacteria when under illumination. Therefore, the nitrogenase activity, hydrogen, NH4+&#8208;N and L&#8208;amino acids production are increased by 260&#8201;%, 37&#8201;%, 44&#8201;%, and 47&#8201;%, respectively. The expression levels of nifD and nifK encoding molybdenum&#8208;iron (MoFe) protein and relevant nitrogen&#8208;fixing proteins are up&#8208;regulated. These photoactive conductive polymer&#8208;bacteria biohybrids provide a new method for improving the biological nitrogen fixation capability of non&#8208;photosynthetic nitrogen&#8208;fixing bacteria.

         <title>Purely Organic Fluorescence Afterglow: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitation, Inherent Mechanism, Tunable Color, and Practical Applications with Very Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient approach of constructing fluorescence afterglow materials triggered by visible light was presented. By dispersing fluorescent dyes with coplanar and rigid chemical structure into matrixes with multiple hydroxyl groups, bright and color tunable fluorescence afterglow was achieved after white&#8208;light irradiation had ceased. The mechanism was investigated, and the aqueous solution of the dye was used for low&#8208;cost anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Purely organic materials with visible light excitable fluorescence afterglow are promising for applications. Herein, fluorescence afterglow with various intensity and duration was observed on fluorescent dyes once being dispersed in polymer matrix, thanks to the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) and long delayed fluorescence lifetime (&#964;DF) derived from the coplanar and rigid chemical structure of the dyes. To verify the mechanism, different polymers were used to tune singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy based on solvent effect. And commercial acriflavine (Acf) film showed blue shifted fluorescence compared to purified one, with slower kRISC (&#8776;100&#8197;s&#8722;1) and longer &#964;DF (0.6&#8197;s). Via energy transfer from Acf to rhodamine B, the afterglow color was further regulated, with the largest fluorescence quantum yield of 42.4&#8201;%. It was demonstrated that the materials worked on color tunable light sources, and low&#8208;cost ($2 for 50&#8201;000&#8197;labels) anti&#8208;counterfeit labels recognized by white light.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of p&#8211;type Organics for Zinc Batteries with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular tailoring of p&#8208;type organics for zinc batteries is achieved by coupling a triphenylamine unit and a phenothiazine unit. The p&#8208;type organic electrodes reach excellent stability (2000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (1.3&#8197;V) and high capacity (145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials are known for their high redox voltages and fast kinetics. However, single&#8208;electron p&#8208;type organic materials generally exhibit low capacity despite high operating voltage and stability, while some multi&#8208;electron p&#8208;type organic materials have high theoretical capacity but low stability. To address this challenge, we explore the possibility of combining single&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;electron units to create high&#8208;capacity and stable p&#8208;type organic electrodes. We demonstrate the design of a new molecule, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazine&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyl) bis (N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline) (PTZAN), which is created by coupling the triphenylamine molecule and the phenothiazine molecule. The resulting PTZAN||Zn battery shows excellent stability (2000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (1.3&#8197;V), high capacity (145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and energy density of 187.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ analysis reveal that the charge storage of the PTZAN electrode is mainly driven by the redox of phenothiazine heterocycles and triphenylamine unit, accompanied by the combination/release of anions and Zn2+.

         <title>Bi&#8208;affinity Electrolyte Optimizing High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese Oxide Battery via Interface Modulation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of an interface modulation strategy has led to the successful development of a high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;rich manganese oxide battery. The optimized dual&#8208;additive electrolyte formulation demonstrated remarkable bi&#8208;affinity and could facilitate the formation of robust interphases on both the anode and cathode simultaneously.







Abstract
The practical implementation of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;rich manganese oxide (LRMO) cathode is limited by the unanticipated electrolyte decomposition and dissolution of transition metal ions. The present study proposes a bi&#8208;affinity electrolyte formulation, wherein the sulfonyl group of ethyl vinyl sulfone (EVS) imparts a highly adsorptive nature to LRMO, while fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits a reductive nature towards Li metal. This interface modulation strategy involves the synergistic use of EVS and FEC as additives to form robust interphase layers on the electrode. As&#8208;formed S&#8208;endorsed but LiF&#8208;assisted configuration cathode electrolyte interphase with a more dominant &#8722;SO2&#8722; component may promote the interface transport kinetics and prevent the dissolution of transition metal ions. Furthermore, the incorporation of S component into the solid electrolyte interphase and the reduction of its poorly conducting component can effectively inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. Therefore, a 4.8&#8197;V LRMO/Li cell with optimized electrolyte may demonstrate a remarkable retention capacity of 97&#8201;% even after undergoing 300&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells Containing Pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;Core&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors with Optimized Orbit Overlap Lengths and Molecular Packing</title>

We developed a series of SMAs (Py1&#8211;Py5) by combining pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline (PyQx) as new electron&#8208;deficient unit with the strategy of cascade chlorination. Py2&#8208;based device yields the best device performance due to the better molecular packing and aggregation behaviors induced by large dipole moments, small &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances and extended orbit overlap lengths in dimers.







Abstract
The central core in A&#8208;DA1D&#8208;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptor (SMAs) plays an important role in determining the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), while the principles governing the efficient design of SMAs remain elusive. Herein, we developed a series of SMAs with pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline (PyQx) as new electron&#8208;deficient unit by combining with the cascade&#8208;chlorination strategy, namely Py1, Py2, Py3, Py4 and Py5. The introduction of chlorine atoms reduces the intramolecular charge transfer effects but elevates the LUMO values. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that Py2 with ortho chlorine substituted PyQx and Py5 with two chlorine atoms yield larger dipole moments and smaller &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances, as compared with the other three acceptors. Moreover, Py2 shows the strongest light absorption capability induced by extended orbit overlap lengths and more efficient packing structures in the dimers. These features endow the best device performance of Py2 due to the better molecular packing and aggregation behaviors, more suitable domain sizes with better exciton dissociation and charge recombination. This study highlights the significance of incorporating large dipole moments, small &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances and extended orbit overlap lengths in dimers into the development of high&#8208;performance SMAs, providing insight into the design of efficient A&#8208;DA1D&#8208;A&#8208;type SMAs for OSCs.

         <title>Sulfur Poisoning and Self&#8208;Recovery of Single&#8208;Site Rh1/Porous Organic Polymer Catalysts for Olefin Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even at the ppm level, sulfur poisoning and regeneration are challenges for metal nanoparticle catalysts, but little is known about single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts. Herein, we describe the unique character of single&#8208;site catalysts (Rh1/POPs) that suffer from H2S poisoning, but could self&#8208;recover and be regenerated by simply withdrawing the H2S. The corresponding Rh nanoparticle demonstrated poor activity and could not be regenerated.







Abstract
Sulfur poisoning and regeneration are global challenges for metal catalysts even at the ppm level. The sulfur poisoning of single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts and their regeneration is worthy of further study. Herein, sulfur poisoning and self&#8208;recovery are first presented on an industrialized single&#8208;Rh&#8208;site catalyst (Rh1/POPs). A decreased turnover frequency of Rh1/POPs from 4317&#8197;h&#8722;1 to 318&#8197;h&#8722;1 was observed in a 1000&#8197;ppm H2S co&#8208;feed for ethylene hydroformylation, but it self&#8208;recovered to 4527&#8197;h&#8722;1 after withdrawal of H2S, whereas the rhodium nanoparticles demonstrated poor activity and self&#8208;recovery ability. H2S reduced the charge density of the single Rh atom and lowered its Gibbs free energy with the formation of inactive (SH)Rh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2, which could be regenerated to active HRh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2 after withdrawing H2S. The mechanism and the sulfur&#8208;related structure&#8211;activity relationship were highlighted. This work provides an understanding of heterogeneous ethylene hydroformylation and sulfur&#8208;poisoned regeneration in the science of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of a Blue&#8208;Emissive Azaborathia[9]helicene by Silicon&#8208;Boron Exchange from Unusual Atropisomeric Teraryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue&#8208;emissive azaborathia[9]helicene was synthesized from atropoisomeric triisopropylsilyl&#8208;substituted teraryls with nearly parallel oriented isoquinoline moieties via silicon&#8208;boron exchange, a new method for the preparation of azaboroles. The target helicene, consisting of two thienoazaborole motifs, shows excellent configurational stability and a luminescence quantum yield of 0.17.







Abstract
We report the concise synthesis and chir(optical) properties of an azaborathia[9]helicene consisting of two thienoazaborole motifs. The key intermediate, a highly congested teraryl with nearly parallel isoquinoline moieties, was generated as a mixture of atropisomers upon fusion of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothiophene moiety. These diastereomers were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealing intriguing interactions in the solid state. Subsequent insertion of boron into the aromatic scaffold via silicon&#8208;boron exchange involving triisopropylsilyl groups fixed the helical geometry, thereby establishing a novel method for the preparation of azaboroles. The ligand exchange at boron in the final step afforded the blue emitter displaying a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 and excellent configurational stability. Detailed structural and theoretical investigation of unusual atropisomers and the helicene provide insights into their isomerization processes.

A CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) is reported for rapid and ultrasensitive detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants. By combining CRISPR technology with highly sensitive field&#8208;effect transistor arrays, CAVRED demonstrated RT&#8208;PCR&#8208;equivalent sensitivity without preamplification and achieved simultaneous profiling of 9 critical RNA mutations associated with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern at single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.







Abstract
Mass pathogen screening is critical to preventing the outbreaks and spread of infectious diseases. The large&#8208;scale epidemic of COVID&#8208;19 and the rapid mutation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) virus have put forward new requirements for virus detection and identification techniques. Here, we report a CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) for the rapid detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants. A series of CRISPR RNA assays were designed to amplify the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system&#8216;s ability to discriminate between mutant and wild RNA genomes with a single&#8208;nucleotide difference. The identified viral RNA information was converted into readable electrical signals through field&#8208;effect transistor biosensors for the achievement of highly sensitive detection of single&#8208;base mutations. CAVRED can detect the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus genome as low as 1&#8197;cp&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1 within 20&#8197;mins without amplification, and this value is comparable to the detection limit of real&#8208;time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Based on the excellent RNA mutation detection ability, an 8&#8208;in&#8208;1 CAVRED array was constructed and realized the rapid identification of 40 simulated throat swab samples of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants with a 95.0&#8201;% accuracy. The advantages of accuracy, sensitivity, and fast speed of CAVRED promise its application in rapid and large&#8208;scale epidemic screening.

         <title>Correlating Photophysical Properties with Stereochemical Expression of 6s2 Lone Pairs in Two&#8208;dimensional Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils structural dynamics and their impacts on photophysical properties of 2D lead iodide perovskites with different spacer cations. Minimizing stereochemical expression of 6s2 lone pair and dynamic octahedral tilting is essential to realize photoluminescence with narrow line shape and high quantum yield via reducing exciton&#8208;phonon coupling.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have shown great promises for light&#8208;emitting applications and excitonic devices. Fulfilling these promises demands an in&#8208;depth understanding on the relationships between the structural dynamics and exciton&#8208;phonon interactions that govern the optical properties. Here, we unveil the structural dynamics of 2D lead iodide perovskites with different spacer cations. Loose packing of an undersized spacer cation leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane octahedral tilting, whereas compact packing of an oversized spacer cation stretches Pb&#8722;I bond length, resulting in Pb2+ off&#8208;center displacement driven by stereochemical expression of the Pb2+ 6s2 lone pair electrons. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Pb2+ cation is off&#8208;center displaced mainly along the direction where the octahedra are stretched the most by the spacer cation. We find dynamic structural distortions associated with either octahedral tilting or Pb2+ off&#8208;centering lead to a broad Raman central peak background and phonon softening, which increase the non&#8208;radiative recombination loss via exciton&#8208;phonon interactions and quench the photoluminescence intensity. The correlations between the structural, phonon, and optical properties are further confirmed by the pressure tuning of the 2D LHPs. Our results demonstrate that minimizing the dynamic structural distortions via a judicious selection of the spacer cations is essential to realize high luminescence properties in 2D LHPs.

         <title>Intermediate Formation of Macrocycles for Efficient Crystallization of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient crystallization strategy is proposed for 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) involving intermediate formation of hexagonal macrocycles. COF&#8208;935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting when exposed to visible light. Even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, COF&#8208;935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained significant attention as key photocatalysts for efficient solar light conversion into hydrogen production. Unfortunately, the harsh synthetic conditions and intricate growth process required to obtain highly crystalline COFs greatly hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a simple strategy for the efficient crystallization of 2D COFs based on the intermediate formation of hexagonal macrocycles. Mechanistic investigation suggests that the use of 2,4,6&#8208;triformyl resorcinol (TFR) as the asymmetrical aldehyde build block allows the equilibration between irreversible enol&#8208;to&#8208;keto tautomerization and dynamic imine bonds to produce the hexagonal &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked macrocycles, the formation of which could provide COFs with high crystallinity in half hour. We show that COF&#8208;935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt as cocatalyst exhibit a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting when exposed to visible light. More importantly, COF&#8208;935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, which is a significant breakthrough in this field. This strategy would provide valuable insights into the design of highly crystalline COFs as efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

Single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) reactions of gaseous CO2 and solid [(NHC)CuH]2 dimers enabled the isolation of unusual dicopper formate species that are inaccessible by conventional solution reactions of CO2.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies of substrate insertion into dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes with two bridging hydrides have been shown to require dimer dissociation to generate transient, highly reactive (NHC)Cu&#8722;H monomers in solution. Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformations, we discovered a new pathway of stepwise insertion of CO2 into [(NHC)CuH]2 without complete dissociation of the dimer. The first CO2 insertion into dimeric [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (IPr*OMe=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;phenyl)imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) produced a dicopper formate hydride [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(&#956;&#8208;H). A second CO2 insertion produced a dicopper bis(formate), [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(&#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;O2CH), containing two different bonding modes of the bridging formate. These dicopper formate complexes are inaccessible from solution reactions since the dicopper core cleanly ruptures to monomeric complexes when dissolved in a solvent.

         <title>A Cleavable Crosslinking Strategy for Commodity Polymer Functionalization and Generation of Reprocessable Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cleavable bis&#8208;diazirine crosslinkers can be used to upgrade commodity, aliphatic polymers into reprocessable thermosets. The method also provides a convenient means to introduce new functionality into polymers, through facile C&#8722;H insertion followed by hydrolysis.







Abstract
Covalently crosslinked polymeric materials, known as thermosets, possess enhanced mechanical strength and thermal stability relative to the corresponding uncrosslinked thermoplastics. However, the presence of covalent inter&#8208;chain crosslinks that makes thermosets so attractive is precisely what makes them so difficult to reprocess and recycle. Here, we demonstrate the introduction of chemically cleavable groups into a bis&#8208;diazirine crosslinker. Application of this cleavable crosslinker reagent to commercial low&#8208;functionality polyolefins (or to a small&#8208;molecule model) results in the rapid, efficient introduction of molecular crosslinks that can be uncoupled by specific chemical inputs. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept findings provide one potential strategy for circularization of the thermoplastic/thermoset plastics economy, and may allow crosslinked polyolefins to be manufactured, used, reprocessed, and re&#8208;used without losing value. As an added benefit, the method allows the ready introduction of functionality into non&#8208;functionalized commodity polymers.

         <title>Introducing Water and Deep Eutectic Solvents in Organosodium Chemistry: Chemoselective Nucleophilic Functionalizations in Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosodium compounds, generated by the oxidative addition of a C&#8722;Cl bond to Na, a halogen/Na exchange, or by direct sodiation using Na bricks or neopentylsodium in hexane, have been intercepted by various electrophiles, when working &#8220;on water&#8221; or in eutectic mixtures. These reactions display a broad substrate scope, under hydrous conditions at room temperature, short reaction times (20&#8197;s), high chemoselectivity, and they are also scalable.







Abstract
Advancing the development of perfecting the use of polar organometallics in bio&#8208;inspired solvents, we report on the effective generation in batch of organosodium compounds, by the oxidative addition of a C&#8722;Cl bond to sodium, a halogen/sodium exchange, or by direct sodiation, when using sodium bricks or neopentylsodium in hexane as sodium sources. C(sp3)&#8208;, C(sp2)&#8208;, and C(sp)&#8208;hybridized alkyl and (hetero)aryl sodiated species have been chemoselectively trapped (in competition with protonolysis), with a variety of electrophiles when working &#8220;on water&#8221;, or in biodegradable choline chloride/urea or L&#8208;proline/glycerol eutectic mixtures, under hydrous conditions and at room temperature. Additional benefits include a very short reaction time (20&#8197;s), a wide substrate scope, and good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) of the desired adducts. The practicality of the proposed protocol was demonstrated by setting up a sodium&#8208;mediated multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the anticholinergic drug orphenadrine.

         <title>Direct Insertion Polymerization of Ionic Monomers: Rapid Production of Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a direct coordination&#8208;insertion polymerization of cation&#8208;containing monomers, allowing facile access to a broad range of materials. Demonstrating the utility of this method, we produced a diverse library of ionic polymers for use as anion exchange membranes and investigated the influence of cation identity on hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability.







Abstract
The limited number of methods to directly polymerize ionic monomers currently hinders rapid diversification and production of ionic polymeric materials, namely anion exchange membranes (AEMs) which are essential components in emerging alkaline fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies. Herein, we report a direct coordination&#8208;insertion polymerization of cationic monomers, providing the first direct synthesis of aliphatic polymers with high ion incorporations and allowing facile access to a broad range of materials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by rapidly generating a library of solution processable ionic polymers for use as AEMs. We investigate these materials to study the influence of cation identity on hydroxide conductivity and stability. We found that AEMs with piperidinium cations exhibited the highest performance, with high alkaline stability, hydroxide conductivity of 87&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and a peak power density of 730&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 when integrated into a fuel cell device.

         <title>A Duplex Polymerization Strategy for General, Programmable and High&#8208;Resolution Nanopore&#8208;Based Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a programmable, general, and flexible signal transduction and resolution&#8208;enhancing concept named target&#8208;induced duplex polymerization strategy (DPS). DPS simultaneously provides size&#8208;amplification and signal&#8208;specificity for solid&#8208;state nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Nanopore sensing is highly promising in single molecular analysis but their broad applications have been challenged by the limited strategies that can transduce a target&#8208;of&#8208;interest into a specific and anti&#8208;false/inference signal, especially for solid&#8208;state nanopores with relatively lower resolution and higher noise. Here we report a high&#8208;resolution signal&#8208;production concept named target&#8208;induced duplex polymerization strategy (DPS). Through linking the same or different duplex substrates (DSs) with a special linker (L) and an optional structure tag (ST), the DPS can generate target&#8208;specific DS polymers with highly controllable duration times, duration intervals and even distinguished secondary tagging currents. Experimentally, DPS mono&#8208;polymerization of single DS and co&#8208;polymerization of multiple DSs has verified the duration time of a DPS product is the sum of those for each DS monomer. Tetrahedron&#8208;DNA structures with different sizes are used as the STs to provide needle&#8208;like secondary peaks for further resolution enhancement and multiplex assay. With these examples DPS represents a general, programmable and advanced strategy that may simultaneously provide size&#8208;amplification, concentration amplification, and signal&#8208;specificity for molecular recognition. It is also promisingly in various applications regarding to single molecular investigation, such as polymerization degree, structure/side chain conformation, programmable multiplex decoding and information index.

Tetrahedron-DNA structures with different sizes are used as the STs to provide needle-like secondary peaks for further resolution enhancement and multiplex assay. With these examples DPS represents a general, programmable and advanced strategy that may simultaneously provide size-amplification, concentration amplification, and signal-specificity for molecular recognition. It is also promisingly in various applications regarding to single molecular investigation, such as polymerization degree, structure/side chain conformation, programmable multiplex decoding and information index.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous PtPb Nanosheets as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution and Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly mesoporous PtPb nanosheets have been successfully synthesized. Due to their abundant active sites and large electrochemical specific surface area, these nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic performance in both electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and selective ethanol oxidation.







Abstract
Using a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method with ethylenediamine, we have synthesized mesoporous PtPb nanosheets that exhibit exceptional activity in both hydrogen evolution and ethanol oxidation. The resulting PtPb nanosheets have a Pt&#8208;enriched structure with up to 80&#8201;% atomic content of Pt. The synthetic method generated a significant mesoporous structure, formed through the dissolution of Pb species. These advanced structures enable the mesoporous PtPb nanosheets to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an extreme low overpotential of 21&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the mesoporous PtPb nanosheets exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability for ethanol oxidation. The highest catalytic current density of PtPb nanosheets is 5.66&#8197;times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This research opens up new possibilities in designing mesoporous, two&#8208;dimensional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy conversion with excellent performance.

         <title>Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Pro&#8208;nanomodulators for Deep&#8208;Tissue Sono&#8208;immunotherapy of Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulator is developed for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Upon ultrasound activation, the polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulator generates singlet oxygen to cause immunogenic cell death and unleash immunomodulators for promoting antitumor immunity, leading to elimination of progression and metastasis of orthotopic pancreatic tumors, and alleviation of immune&#8208;related adverse events.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has provided a promising modality for cancer treatment, while it often has the issues of limited response rates and potential off&#8208;target side effects in clinical practice. We herein report the construction of semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulators (SPpMs) with ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated activatable pharmacological actions for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Such SPpMs consist of a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer backbone grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) chains linked with two immunomodulators (a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 blocker and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase inhibitor) via a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable segment. In view of the excellent sonodynamic property of the semiconducting polymer core, SPpMs enable effective generation of 1O2 under US treatment, even in a deep&#8208;tissue depth up to 12&#8197;cm. The generated 1O2 not only ablates tumors via a sonodynamic effect and induces immunogenic cell death, but also destroys the 1O2&#8208;cleavable segments to allow in situ release of immunomodulators in tumors. This synergetic action results in boosted antitumor immune response via reversing two tumor immunosuppressive pathways. As such, SPpMs mediate deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy to completely eradicate orthotopic pancreatic cancer and effectively prevent tumor metastasis. Moreover, such an immune activation reduces the possibility of immune&#8208;related adverse events. This study thus provides a smart activatable nanoplatform for precise immunotherapy of deep&#8208;seated tumors.

         <title>Annulative &#960;&#8208;Extension by Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Ketone&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation: Rapid Access to Pyrenes and Related Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>

         <dc:description>
An annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (APEX) method is reported to build a benzene ring at the masked bay&#8208;region of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under RhIII&#8208;catalysis. This one&#8208;pot, ketone&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation/annulation reaction between a ketone and an alkyne selectively provides challenging 4,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrenes, and optically pure bipyrene derivatives.







Abstract
Annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (APEX) reaction has become a powerful tool for the precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as nanographene, graphene, and other PAHs possessing unique structure. Herein, an APEX reaction has been realized at the masked bay&#8208;region for the efficient and rapid synthesis of valuable PAH, pyrene, bearing substitutions at the most challenging K&#8208;region. RhIII&#8208;catalyzed ketone&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation at the peri&#8208;position of a naphthyl&#8208;derived ketone, alkyne&#8208;insertion, intramolecular nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl&#8208;group, dehydration, and aromatization steps occurred in one&#8208;pot to effectuate the protocol. Employing this strategy, a two&#8208;fold APEX reaction on enantiopure BINOL&#8208;derived ketones provided access to axially&#8208;chiral bipyrene derivatives. The detailed DFT study to support proposed mechanism, and synthesis of helical PAHs like dipyrenothiophene and dipyrenofuran are other highlights of the present study.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor at Almost 100&#8201;% Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards efficient electrocatalysis of C&#8722;N coupling reactions, the accumulation of critical intermediates, i.e., N&#8208;containing and C&#8208;containing intermediates, must be facilitated. Taking the direct electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime as an example, Fe can serve as an ideal electrode because it can accumulate adsorbed hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone, which is supported by DFT calculations and in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the cyclohexanone&#8208;hydroxylamine process is widespread in the caprolactam industry, which is an upstream industry for nylon&#8208;6 production. However, there are two shortcomings in this process, harsh reaction conditions and the potential danger posed by explosive hydroxylamine. In this study, we presented a direct electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime using nitrogen oxides and cyclohexanone, which eliminated the usage of hydroxylamine and demonstrated a green production of caprolactam. With the Fe electrocatalysts, a production rate of 55.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 can be achieved in a flow cell with almost 100&#8201;% yield of cyclohexanone oxime. The high efficiency was attributed to their ability of accumulating adsorbed hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone. This study provides a theoretical basis for electrocatalyst design for C&#8722;N coupling reactions and illuminates the tantalizing possibility to upgrade the caprolactam industry towards safety and sustainability.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Styrenes by Platinum&#8208; Catalyzed Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydrosilylation of unactivated internal alkynes has been developed. Various styrene&#8208;type atropisomers with open&#8208;chained olefins were obtained with high stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Hydrofunctionalization of alkynes is one of the most efficient ways to access axially chiral styrenes with open&#8208;chained olefins. While great advances have been achieved for 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and analogues, atroposelective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated internal alkynes lags. Herein we reported a platinum&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydrosilylation of unactivated internal alkynes for the first time. With monodentate TADDOL&#8208;derived phosphonite L1 used as a chiral ligand, various axially chiral styrenes were achieved in excellent enantioselectivities with high E&#8208;selectivities. Control experiments showed that the NH&#8208;arylamide groups have significant effects on both the yields and enantioselectivities and could act as directing groups. The potential utilities of the products were shown by the transformations of the amide motifs of the products.

         <title>Platinum/Copper Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition Reactions for the Synthesis of Functionalized Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient platinum/copper dual&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition reaction has been developed. This efficient process provides a novel approach for the asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable indoles bearing a quaternary stereocenter with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee).







Abstract
The development of multicomponent ligands to improve catalytic reactivity and selectivity remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of chiral building blocks. Here, a modular synthesis of structurally diverse multiligated platinum complexes, characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, was revealed to open up a previously inaccessible reaction space. A library of more than 16&#8197;binary component&#8208;ligated platinum complexes was identified as a practical toolkit to enable faster screening. The isolated bench&#8208;stable PtII(oxazoline)(phosphine) complex paired with a chiral copper complex exhibits fundamentally new cooperative reactivity. The newly designed Pt/Cu dual catalytic system contributed to the development of highly enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions between a Pt&#8208;activated electrophilic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbene and a Cu&#8208;activated nucleophile, resulting in a reliable process for the asymmetric synthesis of valuable functionalized indoles in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Directional and Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich ZnO@Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Core&#8208;Shell Junction for Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Photocatalyst/single&#8208;atom catalysts core&#8211;shell heterojunctions were constructed. The strong built&#8208;in electric field across the heterojunction promotes charge separation and migration. Photogenerated electrons could rapidly (2&#8197;ps) transfer from the ZnO &#8220;core&#8221; to the single&#8208;atom Co catalysts &#8220;shell&#8221;, boosting the catalytic performance for heterogeneous photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction.







Abstract
In photosynthesis, solar energy is harvested by photosensitizers, and then, the excited electrons transfer via a Z&#8208;Scheme mode to enzymatic catalytic centers to trigger redox reactions. Herein, we constructed a core&#8211;shell Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction of semiconductor@single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO core and single&#8208;atom Co&#8722;N4 sites supported on nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon shell (SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN) act as the photosensitizer and the enzyme&#8208;mimicking active centers, respectively. Driven by built&#8208;in electric field across the heterojunction, photoexcited electrons could rapidly (2&#8197;ps) transfer from the n&#8208;type ZnO core to the p&#8208;type SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN shell, finally boosting the catalytic performance of the surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;atom Co&#8722;N4 sites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under light irradiation. The synergies between photocatalysis and heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction lead to phenomenally enhanced production of various reactive oxygen species for rapid degradation of various microcontaminants in water. Experimental and theoretical results validate that the interfacial coupling of SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN with ZnO greatly facilitates PMS adsorption and activation by reducing the adsorption energy and enhancing the cascade electron transfer processes for the photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Templated Chiral Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8201;for Enantioselective Chemoresistive Sensing</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a facile synthesis of chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), from achiral precursors grown on chiral nematic cellulose&#8208;derived nanostructured bio&#8208;templates. The chiral structure demonstrates enantioselective recognition and chiral sensing abilities with a low limit of detection of 39&#8197;&#956;M for representative chiral amino acid, D&#8208; and L&#8208; alanine.







Abstract
Chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained rising attention as ordered nanoporous materials for enantiomer separations, chiral catalysis, and sensing. Among those, chiral MOFs are generally obtained through complex synthetic routes by using a limited choice of reactive chiral organic precursors as the primary linkers or auxiliary ligands. Here, we report a template&#8208;controlled synthesis of chiral MOFs from achiral precursors grown on chiral nematic cellulose&#8208;derived nanostructured bio&#8208;templates. We demonstrate that chiral MOFs, specifically, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), unc&#8208;[Zn(2&#8208;MeIm)2, 2&#8208;MeIm=2&#8208;methylimidazole], can be grown from regular precursors within nanoporous organized chiral nematic nanocelluloses via directed assembly on twisted bundles of cellulose nanocrystals. The template&#8208;grown chiral ZIF possesses tetragonal crystal structure with chiral space group of P41, which is different from traditional cubic crystal structure of I&#8208;43&#8197;m for freely grown conventional ZIF&#8208;8. The uniaxially compressed dimensions of the unit cell of templated ZIF and crystalline dimensions are signatures of this structure. We observe that the templated chiral ZIF can facilitate the enantiotropic sensing. It shows enantioselective recognition and chiral sensing abilities with a low limit of detection of 39&#8197;&#956;M and the corresponding limit of chiral detection of 300&#8197;&#956;M for representative chiral amino acid, D&#8208; and L&#8208; alanine.

We designed a catalyst&#8208;derived artificial SEI layer with an ordered polyamide&#8208;lithium hydroxide (PA&#8208;LiOH) bi&#8208;phase structure to modulate ion transport and enable dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition. The PA&#8208;LiOH layer can substantially suppress the volume changes of the Li metal anode (LMA) during Li plating/stripping cycles, as well as alleviate the parasitic reactions between the LMA and the electrolyte.







Abstract
A stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is crucial for lithium metal anode (LMA) to survive in long&#8208;term cycling. However, chaotic structures and chemical inhomogeneity of natural SEI make LMA suffering from exasperating dendrite growth and severe electrode pulverization, which hinder the practical application of LMAs. Here, we design a catalyst&#8208;derived artificial SEI layer with an ordered polyamide&#8208;lithium hydroxide (PA&#8208;LiOH) bi&#8208;phase structure to modulate ion transport and enable dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition.

&lt;p&gt;We designed a catalyst-derived artificial SEI layer with an ordered polyamide-lithium hydroxide (PA-LiOH) bi-phase structure to modulate ion transport and enable dendrite-free Li deposition. The PA-LiOH layer can substantially suppress the volume changes of the Li metal anode (LMA) during Li plating/stripping cycles, as well as alleviate the parasitic reactions between the LMA and the electrolyte.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is crucial for lithium metal anode (LMA) to survive in long-term cycling. However, chaotic structures and chemical inhomogeneity of natural SEI make LMA suffering from exasperating dendrite growth and severe electrode pulverization, which hinder the practical application of LMAs. Here, we design a catalyst-derived artificial SEI layer with an ordered polyamide-lithium hydroxide (PA-LiOH) bi-phase structure to modulate ion transport and enable dendrite-free Li deposition. The PA-LiOH layer can substantially suppress the volume changes of LMA during Li plating/stripping cycles, as well as alleviate the parasitic reactions between LMA and electrolyte. The optimized LMAs demonstrate excellent stability in Li plating/stripping cycles for over 1000&#8197;hours at an ultra-high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Li||Li symmetric cells. A high coulombic efficiency up to 99.2&#8201;% in Li half cells in additive-free electrolytes is achieved even after 500&#8197;cycles at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Managing Multiple Halide&#8208;Related Defects for Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple iodine&#8208;related defects in CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were inhibited by the synergistic effects of halogen, coordination, and hydrogen bonds of 2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (2,6&#8208;DAPy). This results in an excellent power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 21.8&#8201;% for the 2,6&#8208;DAPy&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs, alongside significantly enhanced humidity stabilities of unencapsulated cells.







Abstract
Halide&#8208;related surface defects on inorganic halide perovskite not only induce charge recombination but also severely limit the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells. Herein, adopting density functional theory calculation, we verify that iodine interstitials (Ii) has a low formation energy similar to that of the iodine vacancy (VI) and is also readily formed on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite, and it is regarded to function as an electron trap. We screen a specific 2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (2,6&#8208;DAPy) passivator, which, with the aid of the combined effects from halogen&#8208;Npyridine and coordination bonds, not only successfully eliminates the Ii and dissociative I2 but also passivates the abundant VI. Furthermore, the two symmetric neighboring &#8208;NH2 groups interact with adjacent halides of the octahedral cluster by forming hydrogen bonds, which further promotes the adsorption of 2,6&#8208;DAPy molecules onto the perovskite surface. Such synergetic effects can significantly passivate harmful iodine&#8208;related defects and undercoordinated Pb2+, prolong carrier lifetimes and facilitate the interfacial hole transfer. Consequently, these merits enhance the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.6&#8201;% to 21.8&#8201;%, the highest value for this type of solar cells, just as importantly, the 2,6&#8208;DAPy&#8208;treated CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx films show better environmental stability.

         <title>Efficient Conversion of Biomass to Formic Acid Coupled with Low Energy Consumption Hydrogen Production from Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolysis system was constructed by using polyoxometalates (POMs) as redox medium, which realized efficient conversion of biomass to formic acid (FA) coupled with a low&#8208;cost hydrogen production.







Abstract
The development of a new electrolytic water hydrogen production coupling system is the key to realize efficient and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production and promote its practical application. Herein, a green and efficient electrocatalytic biomass to formic acid (FA) coupled hydrogen production system has been developed. In such a system, carbohydrates such as glucose are oxidized to FA using polyoxometalates (POMs) as the redox anolyte, while H2 is evolved continuously at the cathode. Among them, the yield of glucose to FA is as high as 62.5&#8201;%, and FA is the only liquid product. Furthermore, the system requires only 1.22&#8197;V to drive a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Faraday efficiency of hydrogen production is close to 100&#8201;%. Its electrical consumption is only 2.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3 (H2), which is only 69&#8201;% of that of traditional electrolytic water. This work opens up a promising direction for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production coupled with efficient biomass conversion.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Arylation of Racemic Secondary Benzylic Alcohols to Access Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;Arylated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a single Pd catalyst, the first example of &#946;&#8208;arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been developed via borrowing hydrogen catalysis enabled by an MPV type hydrogen transfer process. In addition, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized under the catalysis of Pd and Ru, allowing for the transformation of racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral alcohols with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The transformation of alcohols into value&#8208;added products is of great importance, as simple alcohols are widespread and can be easily derived from both fossil fuels and biomass. The selective functionalization of a sp3 C&#8722;H bond on the alkyl side chain of an alcohol over its hydroxyl group would offer an expedient route to expand the chemical space of alcohols but it remains a challenging task. Harnessing the borrowing hydrogen strategy, the &#946;&#8208;arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been achieved in this study, which allows for the selective functionalization of a &#946;&#8208;Csp3&#8722;H bond in an alcohol substrate. Under the catalysis of a Pd complex, secondary alcohols reacted with aryl bromides to afford 1,2&#8208;diaryl alcohols with broad substrate scope in the presence of a ketone additive. Furthermore, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized, transforming racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral 1,2&#8208;diaryl alcohols under the cooperative Pd and Ru catalysis. Mechanism studies indicate that the reactions are enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis.

         <title>Easily Scalable Shell&#8208;Structured Copper Catalyst with High Activity and Durability for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous ceria shell was formed on small Cu nanoparticles with a size of &#8804;10&#8197;nm by promoting the surface oxygen transfer. This catalyst presented high activity and durability for CO2 hydrogenation. It could be easily scaled&#8208;up and applied in a bench&#8208;scale reactor, achieving a high CO production rate.







Abstract
Inducing strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) has been a useful way to control the structure of surface active sites. The SMSI often causes the encapsulation of metal particles with an oxide layer. Herein, an amorphous ceria shell was formed on Cu nanoparticles under a mild gas condition with high activity and durability for surface reaction. Cu&#8722;Ce solid solution promoted the transfer of surface oxygen species, which induced the ceria shell formation on Cu nanoparticles. This catalyst was used for CO2 hydrogenation, selectively producing CO with high low&#8208;temperature activity and good durability for operation at high temperature. CO2 activation and H2 spillover could occur at low temperatures, enhancing the activity. The shell prevented the sintering, assuring durability. This catalyst was applied to a bench&#8208;scale reactor without loss in performance, resulting in high CO productivity in all temperature ranges.

Cu&#8722;Ce solid solution promoted the transfer of surface oxygen species, which induced the ceria shell formation on Cu nanoparticles. This catalyst was used for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation, selectively producing CO with high low-temperature activity and good durability for operation at high temperature. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spillover could occur at low temperatures, enhancing the activity. The shell prevented the sintering, assuring durability. This catalyst was applied to a bench-scale reactor without loss in performance, resulting in high CO productivity in all temperature ranges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissection of the Catalytic Mechanisms of Transmembrane Terpene Cyclases Involved in Fungal Meroterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic function of the terpene cyclase AdrI, which cyclizes (6R,10&#8242;R)&#8208;epoxyfarnesyl&#8208;DMOA methyl ester (1) into andrastin&#8197;E (2), was investigated using its AlphaFold2&#8208;generated protein model. This revealed several amino acid residues that are required for reaction initiation and product selectivity. Moreover, a comparison of AdrI with homologues that also cyclize 1 afforded insight into how these cyclases yield diverse cyclized products.







Abstract
Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases are noncanonical transmembrane terpene cyclases involved in the biosynthesis of microbial meroterpenoids and catalyze diverse cyclization reactions. Despite the ubiquity of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases in microorganisms, their three&#8208;dimensional structures have never been experimentally determined. Herein, we focused on AdrI, the Pyr4&#8208;family enzyme for the andrastin A pathway, and its homologues, and performed a series of mutational experiments using their AlphaFold2&#8208;generated structures. Intriguingly, we found that AdrI and InsA7, which both accept the same substrate, use different amino acid residues for the initiation of the cyclization cascade. Furthermore, we obtained several AdrI variants with altered product selectivity, one of which dominantly yielded a new meroterpenoid species. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the catalytic functions of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases and will facilitate the engineering of these enzymes.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Polyimide Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Durable Aluminium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of integrating n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type active sites into one framework to form redox&#8208;bipolar polyimide two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The synthesized 2D polymers are demonstrated as attractive cathode materials for Al batteries by enabling both anion and cation storage.







Abstract
Emerging rechargeable aluminium batteries (RABs) offer a sustainable option for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies with low cost and exemplary safety. However, the development of RABs is restricted by the limited availability of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Herein, we report two polyimide two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) cathodes with redox&#8208;bipolar capability in RAB. The optimal 2D&#8208;COF electrode achieves a high specific capacity of 132&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Notably, the electrode presents long&#8208;term cycling stability (with a negligible &#8776;0.0007&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle), outperforming early reported organic RAB cathodes. 2D&#8208;COFs integrate n&#8208;type imide and p&#8208;type triazine active centres into the periodic porous polymer skeleton. With multiple characterizations, we elucidate the unique Faradaic reaction of the 2D&#8208;COF electrode, which involves AlCl2+ and AlCl4&#8722; dual&#8208;ions as charge carriers. This work paves the avenue toward novel organic cathodes in RABs.

Iron&#8208;oxo molecular clusters constructed from sulfate and iron ions with unique redox activity show porous structures and can be used as excellent anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are considered as promising catalysts with unique redox activity at the molecular level for energy storage. However, eco&#8208;friendly iron&#8208;oxo clusters with special metal coordination structures have rarely been reported for Li&#8208;ion storage. Herein, three novel redox&#8208;active tetranuclear iron&#8208;oxo clusters have been synthesized using the solvothermal method with different ratios of Fe3+ and SO42&#8722;. Further, they can serve as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, cluster H6[Fe4O2(H2O)2(SO4)7]&#8901;H2O, the stable structure extended by SO42&#8722; with a unique 1D pore, displays a specific discharge capacity of 1784&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and good cycle performance (at 0.2&#8197;C and 4&#8197;C). This is the first instance of inorganic iron&#8208;oxo clusters being used for Li&#8208;ion storage. Our findings present a new molecular model system with a well&#8208;defined structure and offer new design concepts for the practical application of studying the multi&#8208;electron redox activity of iron&#8208;oxo clusters.

         <title>Solvation Structure with Enhanced Anionic Coordination for Stable Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bisalt electrolyte with Li trifluoroacetate and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in tetraglyme is applied to form anion&#8208;enhanced solvates for Li&#8208;O2 battery. The strong ion&#8208;ion interactions weaken chelation of Li+ with solvent and lead to inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface and facile desolvation. This benefits dendrite suppression and Coulombic efficiency of Li anodes in Li&#8208;O2 battery.







Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 batteries have garnered much attention due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the irreversible lithium plating/stripping on the anode limits their performance, which has been paid little attention. Herein, a solvation&#8208;regulated strategy for stable lithium anodes in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) based electrolyte is attempted in Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Trifluoroacetate anions (TFA&#8722;) with strong Li+ affinity are incorporated into the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/G4 electrolyte to attenuate the Li+&#8208;G4 interaction and form anion&#8208;dominant solvates. The bisalt electrolyte with 0.5&#8197;M LiTFA and 0.5&#8197;M LiTFSI mitigates G4 decomposition and induces an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This contributes to decreased desolvation energy barrier from 58.20 to 46.31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, compared with 1.0&#8197;M LiTFSI/G4, for facile interfacial Li+ diffusion and high efficiency. It yields extended lifespan of 120&#8197;cycles in Li&#8208;O2 battery with a limited Li anode (7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work gains comprehensive insights into rational electrolyte design for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cyclic dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. The reaction of the acylaluminums with TMSOTf and DMAP gave a ring&#8208;expanded iminium&#8208;substituted aluminate and a 2&#8208;C&#8722;H cleaved product. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated. Throughout the study, acyclic acylaluminums exhibited higher reactivity than that of the cyclic dimer.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Facial&#8208;Selective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent CoH&#8208;catalyzed facial&#8208;selective cyclopropene hydroalkylation has been reported. The reaction works in the absence of any additional directing groups.







Abstract
Cyclopropene hydrofunctionalization has been a promising strategy for accessing multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes; however, cyclopropene hydroalkylation remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report a low&#8208;valent CoH&#8208;catalyzed facial&#8208;selective cyclopropene hydroalkylation to access multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope of alkyl halides and cyclopropenes and tolerates many functional groups. Moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good facial&#8208;selectivity is obtained without any directing groups. Mechanism studies provide evidence that alkyl radicals are generated from alkyl halides and irreversible CoH insertion is responsible for the facial&#8208;selectivity. Our preliminary exploration demonstrates that asymmetric cyclopropene hydroalkylation can be realized without conspicuous auxiliary groups.

         <title>Coupled Solar Battery with 6.9&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A coupled solar battery with a photo&#8208;intercoupled electron&#8208;ion transfer (PIEIT) mechanism enabled high efficiency and large scale solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage, demonstrating the great potential for practical application.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage in solar batteries is an important solar utilization technology comparable to solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity (solar cells) and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel (photocatalytic cells) conversion. Unlike the indirect approach of integrated solar flow batteries combining photoelectrodes with redox&#8208;electrodes, coupled solar batteries enable direct solar energy storage, but are hampered by low efficiency due to rapid charge recombination of materials and misaligned energy levels between electrodes. Herein, we propose a design for a coupled solar battery that intercouples two photo&#8208;coupled ion transfer (PCIT) reactions through electron&#8208;ion transfer upon co&#8208;photo&#8208;pumping of photoelectrochemical storage cathode and anode. We used a representative covalent organic framework (COF) to achieve efficient charge separation and directional charge transfer between two band&#8208;matched photoelectrochemical storage electrodes, with a photovoltage sufficient for COF dual&#8208;redox reactions. By pumping these electrodes, the coupled solar battery stores solar energy via two synergistic PCIT reactions of electron&#8208;proton&#8208;relayed COF oxidation and reduction, and the stored solar energy is released as electrochemical energy during COF regeneration in discharge while interlocking the loops. A breakthrough in efficiency (6.9&#8201;%) was achieved, adaptive to a large&#8208;area (56&#8197;cm2) tandem device. The presented photo&#8208;intercoupled electron&#8208;ion transfer (PIEIT) mechanism provides expandable paths toward practical solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Doped Nickel Oxide and Nickel Nitride Mediate Selective Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Sterol Intermediates Coupled with H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic system comprised of Cr&#8208;NiO/GF and Cr&#8208;Ni3N/GF (GF: graphite felt) was applied to anodic electrooxidation of sterol and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a high space&#8208;time yield of 48.85&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3&#8201;h&#8722;1 for steroid carbonyl and 1.82&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2 in a two&#8208;layer stacked flow cell. This strategy could facilitate large&#8208;scale simultaneous production of H2 and value&#8208;added pharmaceutical carbonyl intermediates.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organics is considered a promising approach for the simultaneous production of hydrogen (H2) and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, exploring and optimizing efficient electrocatalysts remains a challenge for large&#8208;scale production of value&#8208;added steroid carbonyl and H2. Herein, Cr&#8208;NiO/GF and Cr&#8208;Ni3N/GF (GF: graphite felt) electrocatalysts were designed as anode and cathode for the production of steroid carbonyls and H2, respectively. The cooperative Cr&#8208;NiO and ACT (4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl) electrocatalyst can be extended to the electrooxidation of a series of steroid alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. Additionally, Cr&#8208;Ni3N displays superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a low overpotential of 35&#8197;mV to deliver 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the system coupled with anodic electrooxidation of sterol and cathodic HER exhibited excellent performance with high space&#8208;time yield of 48.85&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3&#8201;h&#8722;1 for steroid carbonyl and 1.82&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2 generation in a two&#8208;layer stacked flow cell. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Cr doping effectively stabilizes ACTH on the NiO surface, and ACTH molecule could be captured via the ketonic oxygen interaction with Cr, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic activity. This work develops a novel approach to the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for the simultaneous production of H2 and large&#8208;scale value&#8208;added pharmaceutical carbonyl intermediates.

Herein, we demonstrate an innovative approach for converting nitric oxide (NO) to a series of &#945;&#8208;amino acids (over 13 kinds) through electrosynthesis with &#945;&#8208;keto acids over self&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane with CoFe alloy. The essential leucine exhibits a high yield of 115.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 corresponding a Faradaic efficiency of 32.4&#8201;%, and gram yield of products can be obtained within 24&#8197;hours in lab as well as an ultra&#8208;long stability (&gt;240&#8197;h) of the membrane catalyst, which could convert NO into NH2OH rapidly attacking &#945;&#8208;keto acid and subsequent hydrogenation to form amino acid. In addition, this method is also suitable for other nitrogen sources including gaseous NO2 or liquidus NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;. Therefore, this work not only presents promising prospects for converting nitrogen oxides from exhaust gas and nitrate&#8208;laden waste water into high&#8208;value products, but also has significant implications for synthetizing amino acids in biomedical and catalytic science.

         <title>NIR Clusteroluminescence of Non&#8208;conjugated Phenolic Resins Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonconjugated luminescent materials derived from well&#8208;developed engineering plastics of phenolic resins could fluoresce from deep blue to the NIR region. This remarkable luminescence is attributed to through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) and can be manipulated using two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing D/A groups. The NIR emission endows phenolic resins with practical value as luminescence materials and is a breakthrough in clusteroluminescence from nonconjugated materials.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) and through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) of non&#8208;conjugated molecules have drawn more attention due to their unique photophysical behaviors that are different from largely conjugated luminogens. However, achieving red and even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission from such systems is still challenging due to the intrinsic drawbacks of non&#8208;conjugated molecules and the lack of theories for structure&#8211;property relationships. In this work, six phenolic resins are designed and synthesized based on two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing groups. All phenolic resins are verified as luminogens with CL property (CLgens), and the first example of CLgens with NIR emission (maximum emission wavelength &#8805;680&#8197;nm) and high absolute quantum yield (47&#8201;%) is reported. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal that two TSIs types, through&#8208;space locally excited state and through&#8208;space charge transfer state, play essential roles in achieving CL from these non&#8208;conjugated polymers, which could be manipulated via changing structural conformation and electron density or altering electron transition behaviors. This work not only provides an approach to manipulate TSIs and CL of non&#8208;conjugated polymers but also endows commercially available phenolic resins with high practical value as luminescence materials.

         <title>Achieving Digital Catalysis: Strategies for Data Acquisition, Storage and Use</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In catalysis, a paradigm shift in data acquisition and management is needed to address the challenges in developing high&#8208;performance, stable, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for energy storage and sustainable, climate&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis. Considering the scientific principles of catalysis, the requirements for the future research data infrastructure are discussed.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysis is an important area of research that generates data as intricate as the phenomenon itself. Complexity is inherently coupled to the function of the catalyst and advance in knowledge can only be achieved if this complexity is adequately captured and accounted for. This requires integration of experiment and theory, high data quality and quality control, close interdisciplinary collaboration, and sharing of data and metadata, which is facilitated by the application of joint data management strategies. This Viewpoint Article first discusses the potential of a digital transition in catalysis research. Then, a summary of the current status in terms of data infrastructure in heterogeneous catalysis is presented, defining the various types of (meta&#8208;) data, from catalyst synthesis to functional analysis. Finally, an already implemented working concept for local data acquisition and storage is introduced and the benefits and further development directions for catalysis data use and sharing are discussed.

A new type of amine&#8208;reactive superhydrophobic film that is facilely coated on various substrates is reported by Xinjian Xie and Wenqian Feng in their Research Article (e202302837). The remarkable spatial controllability of surface amine modification is shown, enabling the facile creation of vertical circuits. This discovery provides a distinct approach to establish interlayer electrical connectivity (IEC) within 3D electronic systems.

         <dc:description>
Antibody dynamics on membranes, such as endocytosis and clustering, are vital in determining antibody functions. Yoshiyuki Manabe, Kazuya Kabayama, Koichi Fukase et&#8197;al. proposed a new approach to modulate antibody dynamics and its function. In their Communication (e202304779), the antibody was conjugated with galactose&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycan, and its internalization was suppressed by the interaction with galectin&#8208;3, leading to the enhancement of complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity. The glycan&#8211;antibody conjugate might provide an alternative strategy for enhancing antibody activity.

Rechargeable air batteries utilize oxygen from the atmosphere as the active material in the positive electrode and have high potential as next&#8208;generation energy devices owing to their high energy density. In their Research Article (e202304366), Kenji Miyatake et&#8197;al. design all&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air batteries, in which the negative electrode is free from metals and consists of a redox&#8208;active molecular compound or its polymer to achieve high discharge capacity, rate characteristics, and cyclability.

         <title>Back Cover: Coronaviruses Use ACE2 Monomers as Entry&#8208;Receptors (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 30/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coronavirus (round particles) carrying trimeric spike proteins infects a host cell that expresses monomeric ACE2 receptors. The low density of ACE2 receptors on the cell membrane demonstrates that on average only one spike protein per virus particle can bind to an ACE2 receptor simultaneously, which provides SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 a high infectivity. After binding, the membranes fuse and viral components are released into the cell, as reported by Gerti Beliu, Markus Sauer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202300821).

         <title>Regioselective Difunctionalization and Annulation of Ynamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynamides, a class of unsymmetrical electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;bearing alkynes, have attracted considerable attention for regioselective synthesis applications to build highly functionalized heterocycles. In this review, a concise, yet detailed and thoroughly discussed overview of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization and annulation strategies applied to ynamides including intermolecular difunctionalizations, cyclizations, and radical&#8208;transformations is provided.







Abstract
The use of ynamides in organic synthesis has gained significant attention due to their ability to provide access to complex molecular structures through transformations such as 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization and annulation reactions. These reactions enable the formation of highly functionalized N&#8208;bearing olefins and unusual N&#8208;bearing heterocycles. In this minireview, we present a systematic overview of the regioselective difunctionalization and annulation reactions of ynamides. We discuss the multi&#8208;component reactions, and radical&#8208;triggered functionalizations across the ynamides carbon&#8211;carbon multiple bonds and the use of bifunctional reagents in annulation of ynamides, highlighting their potential in expanding the substrate scope. Furthermore, we provide insights into the mechanistic breakthroughs that have been achieved in recent years in the development of these reactions. Finally, we emphasize the promising future prospects of ynamides as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of complex molecular architectures.

         <title>DNA Nanotechnology for Investigating Mechanical Signaling in the Immune System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we summarized the recent development of DNA nanotechnology for investigating mechanical forces in the immune system. We discussed the force sensing mechanisms of different DNA structures (DNA hairpin and DNA duplex), followed by a survey of DNA tension sensors and gates used to detect the immunoreceptor forces and manipulate mechanical signaling, respectively.







Abstract
Immune recognition occurs at specialized cell&#8208;cell junctions when immune cells and target cells physically touch. In this junction, groups of receptor&#8208;ligand complexes assemble and experience molecular forces that are ultimately generated by the cellular cytoskeleton. These forces are in the range of piconewton (pN) but play crucial roles in immune cell activation and subsequent effector responses. In this minireview, we will review the development of DNA based molecular tension sensors and their applications in mapping and quantifying mechanical forces experienced by immunoreceptors including T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR), Lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen (LFA&#8208;1), and the B&#8208;cell receptor (BCR) among others. In addition, we will highlight the use of DNA as a mechanical gate to manipulate mechanotransduction and decipher how mechanical forces regulate antigen discrimination and receptor signaling.

         <title>The Nephelauxetic Effect Becomes an Important Design Factor for Photoactive First&#8208;Row Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nephelauxetic (cloud&#8208;expanding) effect emerges from covalent character in the chemical bonds between a transition metal (TM) and its coordinated ligands. It alters the repulsion between individual d&#8208;electrons, and this can change the electronic structure of the complex. Now, it becomes increasingly clear how this effect can be used to tune the photophysical and photochemical behavior of coordination compounds made from Earth&#8208;abundant TMs.







Abstract
The expansion of d&#8208;orbitals as a result of metal&#8208;ligand bond covalence, the so&#8208;called nephelauxetic effect, is a well&#8208;established concept of coordination chemistry, yet its importance for the design of new photoactive complexes based on first&#8208;row transition metals is only beginning to be recognized. Until recently, much focus has been on optimizing the ligand field strength, coordination geometries, and molecular rigidity, but now it becomes evident that the nephelauxetic effect can be a game changer regarding the photophysical properties of 3d metal complexes in solution at room temperature. In CrIII and MnIV complexes with the d3 valence electron configuration, the nephelauxetic effect was exploited to shift the well&#8208;known ruby&#8208;like red luminescence to the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. In FeII and CoIII complexes with the low&#8208;spin d6 electron configuration, charge&#8208;transfer excited states were stabilized with respect to detrimental metal&#8208;centered excited states, to improve their properties and to enhance their application potential. In isoelectronic (3d6) isocyanide complexes of Cr0 and MnI, the nephelauxetic effect is likely at play as well, enabling luminescence and other favorable photoreactivity. This minireview illustrates the broad applicability of the nephelauxetic effect in tailoring the photophysical and photochemical properties of new coordination compounds made from abundant first&#8208;row transition metals.

         <title>Rational Design in Photopharmacology with Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of rational design in photopharmacology is analyzed with a focus on E&#8208;Z molecular photoswitches and on computer&#8208;aided approaches. By meticulously examining the design strategies of photopharmacology through the lens of medicinal chemistry, this review identifies existing trends and novel opportunities for the development of photoswitchable ligands.







Abstract
Photopharmacology is an attractive approach for achieving targeted drug action with the use of light. In photopharmacology, molecular photoswitches are introduced into the structure of biologically active small molecules to allow for the optical control of their potency. Going beyond trial and error, photopharmacology has progressively applied rational drug design methodologies to devise light&#8208;controlled bioactive ligands. In this review, we categorize photopharmacological efforts from the standpoint of medicinal chemistry strategies, focusing on diffusible photochromic ligands modified with photoswitches that operate through E&#8208;Z bond isomerization. In the vast majority of cases, photoswitchable ligands are designed as analogs of existing compounds, through a variety of approaches. By analyzing in detail a comprehensive list of instructive examples, we describe the state of the art and discuss future opportunities for rational design in photopharmacology.

         <title>Polyethylene Incorporating Diels&#8211;Alder Comonomers: A &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; Strategy for Chemically Recyclable Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization of ethylene with an oxa&#8208;norbornadiene comonomer enabled a thermally&#8208;triggered post&#8208;polymerization retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder method to reveal double bonds in the polyethylene backbone. The spacing of the backbone unsaturation was tuned and the double bonds served as sites at which further functionalization was performed.







Abstract
Polyolefins with periodic unsaturation in the backbone chain are sought after for synthesizing chemically recyclable polymers or telechelic polyolefin macromonomers. Here we introduce a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of unsaturated high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) via copolymerization of ethylene with dimethyl 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate followed by post&#8208;polymerization retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder to unveil hidden double bonds in the polymer backbone. The incorporation of this &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; comonomer was varied and a series of unsaturated HDPE polymers with block lengths of 1.2, 1.9, and 3.5&#8197;kDa between double bonds was synthesized. Cross metathesis of unsaturated HDPE samples with 2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate yielded telechelic ester terminated PE macromonomers suitable for the preparation of ester&#8208;linked PE. These materials were depolymerized and repolymerized, making them suitable candidates for chemical recycling. The ester&#8208;linked PE displayed thermal and mechanical properties comparable to commercial HDPE.

         <title>Translating Planar Heterocycles into Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogs by Photoinduced Hydrocarboxylation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new strategy that translates indoles and related heterocycles into diverse 3D analogs by dearomative hydrocarboxylation. The transformation is highly chemoselective, broad in scope, operationally simple, and readily amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE).







Abstract
The rapid preparation of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic scaffolds is a key challenge in modern medicinal chemistry. Despite the increased probability of clinical success for small molecule therapeutic candidates with increased 3D complexity, new drug targets remain dominated by flat molecules due to the abundance of coupling reactions available for their construction. In principle, heteroarene hydrofunctionalization reactions offer an opportunity to transform readily accessible planar molecules into more three&#8208;dimensionally complex analogs through the introduction of a single molecular vector. Unfortunately, dearomative hydrofunctionalization reactions remain limited. Herein, we report a new strategy to enable the dearomative hydrocarboxylation of indoles and related heterocycles. This reaction represents a rare example of a heteroarene hydrofunctionalization that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug discovery. The transformation is highly chemoselective, broad in scope, operationally simple, and readily amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). Accordingly, this process will allow existing libraries of heteroaromatic compounds to be translated into diverse 3D analogs and enable exploration of new classes of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl Difluoride (EDSF) for SuFEx Click Chemistry: Synthesis of SuFExable 1,1&#8208;Bissulfonylfluoride Substituted Cyclobutene Hubs</title>

         <dc:description>
Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF) represents a novel SuFEx connector hub. Here, we demonstrate the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of EDSF with aryl acetylenes, which rapidly and regioselectively generates unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes. Moreover, these products can selectively undergo SuFEx reactions with phenols, highlighting their potential for constructing complex molecular architectures.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;bis(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, a bench&#8208;stable precursor to ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF). The novel SuFEx reagent, EDSF, is demonstrated in the preparation of 26 unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes via a cycloaddition reaction. The regioselective click cycloaddition reaction is rapid, straightforward, and highly efficient, enabling the generation of highly functionalized 4&#8208;membered ring (4MR) carbocycles. These carbocycles are valuable structural motifs found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules. Additionally, we showcase diversification of the novel cyclobutene cores through selective Cs2CO3&#8208;activated SuFEx click chemistry between a single S&#8722;F group and an aryl alcohol, yielding the corresponding sulfonate ester products with high efficiency. Finally, density functional theory calculations offer mechanistic insights about the reaction pathway.

Additionally, we showcase diversification of the novel cyclobutene cores through selective Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-activated SuFEx click chemistry between a single S&#8722;F group and an aryl alcohol, yielding the corresponding sulfonate ester products with high efficiency. Finally, density functional theory calculations offer mechanistic insights about the reaction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
NCF2H compounds are seen widely in approved and experimental drugs, yet methods to install this moiety are limited. A direct N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)sulfonamidation protocol is presented, and enables the diversification of NCF2H compounds to benefit drug discovery. This photoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy employs a novel pyridinium reagent with broad functional group tolerance and showcases the effective adaptation of a continuous flow protocol.







Abstract
N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)amino (&#8722;NCF2H) compounds are of great interest given their unique and underexplored physiochemical properties. The lack of structural diversity in NCF2H compounds is likely due in part to the shortage of protocols for efficient installation. Presented herein is a new shelf&#8208;stable pyridinium reagent that enables the direct installation of the N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)sulfonamide moiety [N(Ts)CF2H)] onto (hetero)arenes and alkenes for the diversification of aryl and alkyl NCF2H compounds. The described protocol utilizes blue light photoredox catalysis and displays broad functional group tolerance with excellent chemoselectivity. Additional transformations and applicability towards a photoredox continuous flow protocol are also demonstrated.

         <title>Catalytic Linkage Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with various catalytic linkages (imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds) have been demonstrated to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction. The carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the formation of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form OH*, thus showing higher activity than other COFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To achieve high activity and selectivity, various building blocks containing heteroatoms and groups linked by imine bonds were used to create catalytic COFs. However, the roles of linkages of COFs in ORR have not been investigated. In this work, the catalytic linkage engineering has been employed to modulate the catalytic behaviors. To create single catalytic sites while avoiding other possible catalytic sites, we synthesized COFs from benzene units linked by various bonds, such as imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds. Among these COFs, the oxazole&#8208;linkage in COFs enables to catalyze the ORR with the highest activity, which achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.75&#8197;V and a limited current density of 5.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the oxazole&#8208;linked COF achieved a conversion frequency (TOF) value of 0.0133&#8197;S&#8722;1, which were 1.9, 1.3, and 7.4&#8208;times that of azine&#8208;, amide&#8208; and imine&#8208;COFs, respectively. The theoretical calculation showed that the carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the formation of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form the OH*, thus advancing the catalytic activity. This work guides us on which linkages in COFs are suitable for ORR.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Air Batteries Using Dihydroxybenzoquinone and Its Polymer as the Negative Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery has been achieved using a redox&#8208;active organic molecule (dihydroxybenzoquinone, DHBQ) as the negative electrode active material and a proton exchange membrane as the electrolyte. The high redox activity of DHBQ with the polymer electrolyte made the concept of the device possible and furthermore, use of polymeric DHBQ improved significantly the discharge capacity with reasonable cyclability.







Abstract
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study was conducted on an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery (SSAB) using redox&#8208;active 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DHBQ) and its polymer (PDBM) and a proton&#8208;conductive polymer (Nafion). DHBQ functioned well in the redox reaction with the solid Nafion ionomer at 0.47 and 0.57&#8197;V vs. RHE, similar to that in acid aqueous solution. The resulting air battery exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.80&#8197;V and a discharge capacity of 29.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;gDHBQ&#8722;1 at a constant current density (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). With PDBM, the discharge capacity was much higher, 176.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPDBM&#8722;1, because of the improved utilization of the redox&#8208;active moieties. In the rate characteristics of the SSAB&#8208;PDBM, the coulombic efficiency was 84&#8201;% at 4&#8197;C, which decreased to 66&#8201;% at 101&#8197;C. In a charge/discharge cycle test, the capacity remaining after 30&#8197;cycles was 44&#8201;%, which was able to be significantly improved, to 78&#8201;%, by tuning the Nafion composition in the negative electrode.

         <title>Exploring the Strain Effect in Single Particle Electrochemistry using Pd Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy enables the high throughput analysis of individual well&#8208;shaped Pd nanocrystals to estimate the intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity and reveal the structural origin of surface strain for the superior activity.







Abstract
Tuning the surface strain of heterogeneous catalysts is recognized as a powerful strategy for tailoring their catalytic activity. However, a clear understanding of the strain effect in electrocatalysis at single&#8208;particle resolution is still lacking. Here, we explore the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of single Pd octahedra and icosahedra with the same surface bounded {111} crystal facet and similar sizes using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). It is revealed that tensilely strained Pd icosahedra display significantly superior HER electrocatalytic activity. The estimated turnover frequency at &#8722;0.87&#8197;V vs RHE on Pd icosahedra is about two times higher than that on Pd octahedra. Our single&#8208;particle electrochemistry study using SECCM at Pd nanocrystals unambiguously highlights the importance of tensile strain on electrocatalytic activity and may offer new strategy for understanding the fundamental relationship between surface strain and reactivity.

         <dc:description>
Various zinc and magnesium reagents were successfully aminated using O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl hydroxylamines (O&#8208;TBHAs) leading to the corresponding tertiary alkyl amines in 52&#8211;99&#8201;% yield without any additional transition&#8208;metal catalyst. This reaction was extended to the preparation of optically enriched amines (up to 88&#8201;% ee) starting from enantioenriched secondary alkylmagnesium reagents of the type s&#8208;AlkylMgCH2SiMe3.







Abstract
We reported a new electrophilic amination of various primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, benzylic, allylic zinc and magnesium organometallics with O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl hydroxylamines (O&#8208;TBHAs) in 52&#8211;99&#8201;% yield. These O&#8208;TBHAs displayed an excellent long&#8208;term stability and were readily prepared from various highly functionalized secondary amines via a convenient 3 step procedure. The amination reactions showed remarkable chemoselectivity proceeding without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst and were usually complete after 1&#8211;3&#8197;h reaction time at 25&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, this electrophilic amination also provided access to enantioenriched tertiary amines (up to 88&#8201;% ee) by using optically enriched secondary alkylmagnesium reagents of the type s&#8208;AlkylMgCH2SiMe3.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Promoted Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Access to Functionalized Azetidines from Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current work presents a new strategy for tandem N1,C3&#8208;functionalization and formal [3+2] cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane (ABB) promoted by an aza(oxy)allyl cation. This cationic activation paradigm proves highly versatile and effective, and is expected to create new impetus for preparing functionalized azetidines from ABBs.







Abstract
Access to 1,3&#8208;functionalized azetidines through a diversity&#8208;oriented approach is highly sought&#8208;after for finding new applications in drug&#8208;discovery. To this goal, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven functionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane (ABB) has generated significant interest. Through appropriate N&#8208;activation, C3&#8208;substituted ABBs are shown to render tandem N/C3&#8208;fucntionalization/rearrangement, furnishing azetidines; although, modalities of such N&#8208;activation vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis N&#8208;functionalization remain limited to selected electrophiles. This work showcases a versatile cation&#8208;driven activation strategy of ABBs. And capitalizes on the use of Csp3 precursors amenable to forming reactive (aza)oxyallyl cations in situ. Herein, N&#8208;activation leads to formation of a congested C&#8722;N bond, and effective C3 activation. The concept was extended to formal [3+2] annulations involving (aza)oxyallyl cations and ABBs, leading to bridged bicyclic azetidines. Besides the fundamental appeal of this new activation paradigm, operational simplicity and remarkable diversity should engender its prompt use in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Combining Imine Condensation Chemistry with [3,3] Diaza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement for One&#8208;Step Formation of Hydrolytically Stable Chiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral hydrolytically stable cages have been prepared by a strategy that combines the advantages of a thermodynamic driven (dynamic covalent chemistry) formation of a supramolecular structure using imine chemistry together with a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. This approach of &#8220;freezing the dynamics&#8221; has been demonstrated with chiral tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine &#8208;based systems, which are hydrolytically stable due to the formation of C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has, in recent years, provided valuable tools to synthesize molecular architectures of increasing complexity. We have also taken advantage of imine DCC chemistry to prepare TPMA&#8208;based supramolecular cages for molecular recognition applications. However, the versatility of this approach has as a major drawback the intrinsic hydrolytic lability of imines, which hampers some applications. We present herein a synthetic strategy that combines the advantages of a thermodynamic&#8208;driven formation of a supramolecular structure using imine chemistry, together with the possibility to synthetize chiral hydrolytically stable structures through a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A preliminary mechanistic analysis of this one&#8208;pot synthesis and the scope of the reaction are also discussed.

         <title>Improvement of Antibody Activity by Controlling Its Dynamics Using the Glycan&#8211;Lectin Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208;HER2 antibody was conjugated with galactose&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycan, and its internalization was suppressed by the interaction with galectin&#8208;3, leading to the enhancement of complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity. The glycan&#8211;antibody conjugate suggests a new approach to modulate antibody activity and might provide an alternative strategy for enhancing antibody activity.







Abstract
Antibody dynamics on membranes, such as endocytosis and clustering, are vital in determining antibody functions. In this study, we demonstrated that glycan conjugation can modulate antibody dynamics through the glycan&#8211;lectin interaction to regulate its potency. The anti&#8208;HER2 antibody, an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer antibody, was conjugated with galactose&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycan, and its internalization was suppressed by interaction with galectin&#8208;3, leading to enhanced complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity. This glycan&#8211;antibody conjugate is proposed as a new approach to modulate antibody activity and may provide an alternative strategy for redeveloping antibody drugs that do not exhibit sufficient activity.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Copper 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement: the New Concept Behind the Boryl Migration from C(sp2) in Alkenyl Boranes to C(sp3)</title>

         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;Xantphos system promotes the regioselective borylcupration of borylated skipped (Z)&#8208;dienes generating diborylated alkylcopper species that further induce a stereospecific B/Cu 1,3&#8208;rearrangement through remote B shift from C(sp2) to C(sp3). The boryl migration occurs via a 4&#8208;membered boracycle, followed by an in situ electrophilic trapping allowing C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond formation and alkylidenecyclohexane or &#8208;cyclobutane synthesis.







Abstract
Regioselective borylcupration of borylated skipped (Z)&#8208;dienes generates diborylated alkylcopper species that are involved in an intramolecular stereospecific B/Cu 1,3&#8208;rearrangement by migration of Bpin moiety from C(sp2) to C(sp3). DFT mechanistic studies showed that boryl migration occurs through the formation of 4&#8208;membered boracycle intermediate with a moderate free&#8208;energy barrier. Moreover, the use of KOMe forms stable Lewis base adducts with Bpin moieties that blocks the reaction. Subsequently to the 1,3&#8208;boron shift, the in situ electrophilic trapping allows selective C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds, followed by intramolecular cross coupling giving access to cyclic functionalized alkylidenecyclohexanes or alkylidenecyclobutanes.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Molecular Engineering of Triazole&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymeric Photocatalysts with Strong Electron Push&#8208;Pull Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor polymer photocatalysts bearing alkyl chains were synthesized to explore the effect of side&#8208;chain engineering on charge separation and migration kinetics. High activity was reached in photocatalytic reduction reactions with promoted exciton dissociation, suppressed charge recombination, facilitated charge transfer, and favorable hydrophilicity. Key: donor (D), acceptor (A), pyrene (green), triazole (yellow), methyl (red).







Abstract
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;type semiconductive polymers were generated by the integration of electron&#8208;deficient alkyl chain anchored triazole (TA) moieties and electron&#8208;rich pyrene units into the polymer skeleton. The polymer series demonstrated satisfactory light&#8208;harvesting ability and suitable band gaps. In the series, polymer P&#8208;TAME benefits from a minimized exciton binding energy, strongest D&#8208;A interaction, and favorable hydrophilicity, affording an outstanding photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ca. 100&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (10&#8197;mg polymer, AQY420&#8201;nm=8.9&#8201;%) and H2O2 production rate of ca. 190&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (20&#8197;mg polymer) under visible&#8208;light irradiation, which is superior to most currently reported polymers. All polymers in the series can mediate water oxidation reactions to evolve O2. Thus, these TA&#8208;based polymers open up a new avenue toward tailor&#8208;made efficient photocatalysts with broad photocatalytic activities.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion via Optimized Photothermal Catalysis in a Lotus Pod Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potassium&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported cobalt catalyst mimicking the structure of a lotus pod is developed. With hierarchical pores, intimate Co/C interfaces, and exposed catalytic sites, the catalyst shows a record&#8208;high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation rate with near&#8208;unity selectivity for CO.







Abstract
Photothermal CO2 reduction is one of the most promising routes to efficiently utilize solar energy for fuel production at high rates. However, this reaction is currently limited by underdeveloped catalysts with low photothermal conversion efficiency, insufficient exposure of active sites, low active material loading, and high material cost. Herein, we report a potassium&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported cobalt (K+&#8722;Co&#8722;C) catalyst mimicking the structure of a lotus pod that addresses these challenges. As a result of the designed lotus&#8208;pod structure which features an efficient photothermal C substrate with hierarchical pores, an intimate Co/C interface with covalent bonding, and exposed Co catalytic sites with optimized CO binding strength, the K+&#8722;Co&#8722;C catalyst shows a record&#8208;high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation rate of 758&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (2871&#8197;mmol&#8201;gCo&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with a 99.8&#8201;% selectivity for CO, three orders of magnitude higher than typical photochemical CO2 reduction reactions. We further demonstrate with this catalyst effective CO2 conversion under natural sunlight one hour before sunset during the winter season, putting forward an important step towards practical solar fuel production.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of 3&#8208;Substituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzophenone&#8208;based catalyst was used as the only source of chirality in the photochemical deracemization of 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles. The reaction likely proceeds by hydrogen atom transfer and delivers the desired products, and derivatives thereof, with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Racemic 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles were successfully converted into enantiomerically pure or enriched material (up to 99&#8201;% ee) upon irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral benzophenone catalyst (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The photochemical deracemization process allows predictable editing of the stereogenic center at carbon atom C3. Light energy compensates for the associated loss of entropy and enables the decoupling of potentially reversible reactions, i.e. a hydrogen atom transfer to (photochemical) and from (thermal) the carbonyl group of the catalyst. The major enantiomer is continuously enriched in several catalytic cycles. The obtained oxindoles were shown to be valuable intermediates for further transformations, which proceeded with complete retention at the stereogenic center.

         <title>Molecular Flytraps Held Together by Platinum&#8211;Platinum Intermetallic Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;metal bonds have rarely been sighted in the supramolecular realm, yet they can provide a number of features from which to harvest dynamic behavior and responsiveness. Here, a single Pt&#8722;Pt bond was used to glue two cyclometalated hosts together and generate a flytrap&#8208;like molecule. This compound traps inorganic ions in its jaw, assembles and disassembles photochemically, and irreversibly transports guests from solution to the solid state.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal bonds have rarely been explored as active elements in supramolecular assemblies despite their unique potential to introduce responsive behavior. In this report, a dynamic molecular container composed of two cyclometalated Pt units is constructed using Pt&#8722;Pt bonds. This molecule&#8212;the flytrap&#8212;has a flexible jaw composed of two [18]crown&#8208;6 ethers that can adapt their shape to bind large inorganic cations with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity. Along with the spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the flytrap, we report its photochemical assembly, which allows the capture of ions and their transport from solution to the solid state. In addition, we have been able to recycle the flytrap to regenerate its starting material due to the reversible nature of the Pt&#8722;Pt bond. We believe that other molecular containers and materials for harvesting valuable substrates from solution could be assembled using the advances presented here.

Reductions of simple amido&#8208; and aryloxy&#8722;aluminum dihydride complexes with dimagnesium(I) reagents have afforded deep red mixed&#8208;valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66 (see picture).

Reduction of a range of amido&#8208; and aryloxy&#8208;aluminum dihydride complexes, e.g. [AlH2(NR3){N(SiMe3)2}] (NR3=NMe3 or N&#8208;methylpiperidine (NMP)), with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) reagents, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8722;, Ar=mesityl (Mes) or 2,6&#8208;xylyl (Xyl)), have afforded deep red mixed valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, [Al6H8(NR3)2{Mg(ArNacnac)}4], which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66, the lowest for any well&#8208;defined aluminum hydride compound. In the solid&#8208;state, the clusters are shown to have distorted octahedral Al6 cores, having zero&#8208;valent Al axial sites and mono&#8208;valent AlH2&#8722; equatorial units. Several novel by&#8208;products were isolated from the reactions that gave the clusters, including the Mg&#8722;Al bonded magnesio&#8208;aluminate complexes, [(ArNacnac)(Me3N)Mg&#8722;Al(&#956;&#8208;H)3[{Mg(ArNacnac)}2(&#956;&#8208;H)]]. Computational analyses of one aluminum hydride cluster revealed its Al6 core to be electronically delocalized, and to possess one unoccupied, and six occupied, skeletal molecular orbitals.

         <title>A Nitrogen Battery Electrode involving Eight&#8208;Electron Transfer per Nitrogen for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;centered redox cycle operating between ammonia and nitrate via an eight&#8208;electron transfer as a catholyte was successfully implemented for Zn&#8208;based flow battery. A very competitive energy density of 577&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 and 930 charging&#8208;discharging cycles can be reached, demonstrating nitrogen cycle can offer promising cathodic redox chemistry for safe, affordable, and scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries have been discussed as scalable and simple stationary energy storage devices. However, currently developed systems encounter less competitive energy density and high costs, restricting their wider application. There is a lack of appropriate redox chemistry, preferably based on active materials that are abundant in nature and show high solubility in aqueous electrolytes. A nitrogen&#8208;centered redox cycle operating between the limiting species ammonia and nitrate via an eight&#8208;electron redox reaction stayed practically unnoticed, albeit its ubiquity in biological processes. Ammonia or nitrate are world&#8208;scale chemicals with high aqueous solubility, and are then comparably safe. We demonstrate here the successful implementation of such a nitrogen&#8208;based redox cycle between ammonia and nitrate with eight&#8208;electron transfer as a catholyte for Zn&#8208;based flow batteries, which continuously worked for 12.9&#8197;days with 930 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. A very competitive energy density of 577&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 can be reached, which is well above most reported flow batteries (e.g. 8&#8197;times the standard Zn&#8208;bromide battery), demonstrating that the nitrogen cycle with eight&#8208;electron transfer can offer promising cathodic redox chemistry for safe, affordable, and scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Formal (4+1) Carbocyclization of Chalcones with Internal Alkynes via Rhodium(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcones can unusually serve as the precursors of acetophenones which then undergo formal (4+1) cyclization with internal alkynes via rhodium(III) catalysis in a regio&#8208; and chemoselective manner. 1&#8208;Indanones containing quaternary carbon centers along with reusable aryl aldehydes were formed by this annulation. This discovery enables a practical two&#8208;step protocol to indanones from the reaction of acetophenones with internal alkynes.







Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization of chalcones with internal alkynes is reported, generating biologically important 3,3&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;indanones along with reusable aromatic aldehydes. This transformation features unique (4+1) reaction mode, excellent regioselectivity in alkyne insertion, broad substrate scope, allows for the construction of quaternary carbon centers, and is scalable. Steric hindrance from substrate and ligand probably controls the chemoselectivity of this carbocyclization. Importantly, this discovery enables a practical two&#8208;step protocol switching the overall reaction of acetophenones with internal alkynes from a (3+2) to a (4+1) annulation.

         <title>Selective Terminal Functionalization of Linear Alkanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step sequential strategy, involving a biocatalytic dehydrogenation/remote hydrofunctionalization as a unified and versatile approach to selectively convert linear alkanes into a large array of valuable functionalized aliphatic derivatives is reported. The reaction goes through a site&#8208;selective functionalization at the unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds of the linear alkane and avoids the use of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step sequential strategy involving a biocatalytic dehydrogenation/remote hydrofunctionalization, as a unified and versatile approach to selectively convert linear alkanes into a large array of valuable functionalized aliphatic derivatives is reported. The dehydrogenation is carried out by a mutant strain of a bacteria Rhodococcus and the produced alkenes are subsequently engaged in a remote functionalization through a metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrometalation/migration sequence that subsequently react with a large variety of electrophiles. The judicious implementation of this combined biocatalytic and organometallic approach enabled us to develop a high&#8208;yielding protocol to site&#8208;selectively functionalize unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>A Proximity&#8208;Induced Fluorogenic Reaction Triggered by Antibody&#8211;Antigen Interactions with Adjacent Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>

We designed a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction by using two monoclonal antibodies to interact with different epitopes of an antigen. Accelerated reaction was observed using a fluorescence&#8208;based method and the importance of epitope selection was demonstrated.







Abstract
Proximity&#8208;induced chemical reactions are site&#8208;specific and rapid by taking advantage of their high affinity and highly selective interactions with the template. However, reactions induced solely by antibody&#8211;antigen interactions have not been developed. Herein, we propose a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER) as a novel template reaction. In BATER, reactive functional groups are conjugated to two antibodies that interact with two epitopes of the same antigen to accelerate the reaction. We developed a method for visualizing the progress of BATER using fluorogenic click chemistry for optimal antibody selection and linker design. The reaction is accelerated in the presence of a specific antigen in a linker length&#8208;dependent manner. The choice of the antibody epitope is important for a rapid reaction. This design will lead to various applications of BATER in living systems.

         <title>Conformationally Locked Cyclo[2]Dipyrrins Linked with Anthracene Subunits: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 30, July 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracene&#8208;containing helically locked &#8216;Figure of eight&#8217; expanded porphyrin has been obtained by a simple condensation strategy. The 3D crystal packing showed the presence of two helical enantiomers, which were stable enough to be separated in solution. The P,P and M,M enantiomers show moderate chiroptical properties (gabs ca.10&#8722;3 and glum=3.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 700&#8197;nm) and are not interconvertible, presumably because of a high racemization barrier.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of anthracene&#8208;containing twisted cyclo[2]dipyrrin 1 by utilizing a non&#8208;planar building block, 1,5&#8208;dipyrrylanthracene (1,5&#8208;DPA). The non&#8208;planar nature of the macrocycle enhanced the solubility and helped in structural characterization. Macrocycle 1 adopts a twisted &#8216;figure of eight&#8217; conformation stabilized by strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions and exists as a pair of helical enantiomers, as revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. More importantly, the sterically locked structure enabled facile optical resolution using chiral HPLC. The (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomers show moderate chiroptical properties, such as absorption dissymmetry factors |gabs| in the order of 10&#8722;3, and luminescence dissymmetry factors |glum| of 3.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and 2.9&#215;10&#8722;3 at 702&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <title>Migration and Precipitation of Platinum in Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the recent progress in increasing the power generation of Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), their durability is still far lower than that of Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we have identified Pt ion migration as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of AEMFCs. In alkaline media Pt+2 ions are easily formed which then either undergo dissolution into the carbon support or migrate to the membrane. In contrast to PEMFCs, where hydrogen cross over reduces the ions forming a vertical &#8220;Pt line&#8221; within the membrane, the ions in the AEM are trapped by charged groups within the membrane, leading to disintegration of the membrane and failure. Diffusion of the metal components is still observed when the Pt/C of the cathode is substituted with a FeCo&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst, but in this case the Fe and Co ions are not trapped within the membrane, but rather migrate into the anode, thereby increasing the stability of the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based Cluster&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Framework for Polysulfide Conversion and Guest&#8211;host Recognition in Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF) still remains challenging due to an extremely difficult task in rationally interconnecting two dissimilar building blocks. Here we report an unprecedented POM&#8208;CD&#8208;based framework crystalline structure produced through the self&#8208;assembly process of a Krebs&#8208;type polyoxometalate, [Zn2(WO2)2(SbW9O33)2]10&#8208;, and two &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin units (&#946;&#8208;CD). For the first time, we present the exploration of new application forms of POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF materials in Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The as&#8208;prepared POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF&#8208;based battery separator can be applied as a lightweight barrier (approximately 0.3 mg cm&#8722;2) to mitigate the fundamental polysulfide shuttle effect in Lithium&#8208;sulfur chemistry. The designed Li&#8208;S batteries equipped with the POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF modified separator exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, attributed to fast Li+ diffusion through the supramolecular channel of &#946;&#8208;CD, efficient polysulfide&#8208;capture ability by the dynamic host&#8208;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD, and improved sulfur redox kinetics by the bidirectional catalysis of POM cluster. This research provides a broad perspective for the development of multifunctional supramolecular POM frameworks and their applications in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Poly (Triazine Imide) Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (triazine imide) (PTI/Li+Cl&#8208;), one of the crystalline versions of polymeric carbon nitrides, holds great promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting. In principle, the photocatalytic activity of PTI/Li+Cl&#8208; is closely related to the morphology, which could be reasonably tailored by the modulation of the polycondensation process. Herein, we demonstrate that the hexagonal prisms of PTI/Li+Cl&#8208; could be converted to hexagonal nanosheets by adjusting the binary eutectic salts from LiCl/KCl or NaCl/LiCl to ternary LiCl/KCl/NaCl. Results reveal that the extension of in&#8208;plane conjugation is preferred, when the polymerisation was performed in the presence of ternary eutectic salts. The hexagonal nanosheets bears longer lifetimes of charge carriers than that of hexagonal prisms due to lower intensity of structure defects and shorter hopping distance of charge carriers along the stacking direction of triazine nanosheets. The optimized hexagonal nanosheets exhibits a record apparent quantum yield value of 25% (&#955;=365nm) for solar hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonclassical Crystallization Causes Dendritic and Band&#8208;like Microscale Patterns in Inorganic Precipitates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;organization of complex solids can create patterns extending hierarchically from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. A frequently studied model is the chemical garden system which consists of life&#8208;like precipitate shapes. In this study, we examine the thin walls of chemical gardens using microfluidic devices that yield linear Ni(OH)&#8322;&#160;precipitate membranes. We observe distinct light&#8208;scattering patterns within the compositionally pure membranes, including disorganized spots, dendrites, and parallel bands. The bands are tilted with respect to the membrane axis and their spacing (20&#8209;100&#160;&#956;m) increases with increasing flow rates. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the bands consist of submicron particles embedded in a denser material and these particles are also found in the reactant stream. We propose that dendrites and bands arise from the attachment of solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles. The bands are generated by particle&#8208;aggregation zones moving upstream along the slowly advancing membrane surface. The speed of the aggregation zones is proportional to the band distance and defines the system&#8217;s dispersion relation. This speed&#8208;wavelength dependence and the flow&#8208;opposing motion of the aggregation zones are likely caused by low particle concentrations in the wake of the zones that only slowly recover due to Brownian motion and particle nucleation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unidirectional Sidechain Engineering to Construct Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Acceptors for 19.23%&#160;Efficiency&#160;Organic Solar Cells&#160;with Low Energy Loss and Efficient Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC)&#160;to boost power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) is a major challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs), wherein high energy loss (Eloss) and inefficient charge transfer usually take place. Here, three new Y&#8208;series acceptors of mono&#8208;asymmetric asy&#8208;YC11 and dual&#8208;asymmetric bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC9 and bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 are developed. They share the same asymmetric D1AD2&#160;(D1=thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and D2=selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) fused&#8208;core but have different unidirectional sidechain&#160;on D1&#160;side, allowing fine&#8208;tuned molecular properties, such as intermolecular interaction, packing pattern,&#160;and crystallinity. Among the binary blends, the PM6:bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 one has better morphology with appropriate phase separation and higher order packing than the PM6:asy&#8208;YC9 and PM6:bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC11 ones. Therefore, the PM6:bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs&#160;offer a higher&#160;PCE of 17.16% with both high VOC&#160;and&#160;JSC, due to the reduced&#160;Eloss&#160;and&#160;efficient charge transfer properties. Inspired by the high VOC&#160;and strong NIR&#8208;absorption, bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 is introduced into efficient binary&#160;PM6:L8&#8208;BO to construct &#160;ternary OSCs. Thanks to the broadened absorption, optimized morphology, and furtherly minimized Eloss, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs achieve&#160;a champion PCE of 19.23%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among these annealing&#8208;free devices.

         <title>Enhanced Spatial Charge Separation in a Niobium and Tantalum Nitride Core&#8208;Shell Photoanode: In Situ Interface Bonding for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the inefficient electron&#8208;hole separation remains a bottleneck that impedes its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a core&#8208;shell nanoarray photoanode of NbNx&#8208;nanorod@Ta3N5 ultrathin layer enhances light harvesting and forms a spatial charge transfer channel, which leads to the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. Consequently, an impressive photocurrent density of 7 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 VRHE is obtained with an ultrathin Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30 nm, accompanied by excellent stability and a low onset potential (0.46 VRHE). Mechanistic studies reveal the enhanced performance is attributed to the high&#8208;conductivity NbNx core, high&#8208;crystalline Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell, and the intimate Ta&#8208;N&#8208;Nb interface bonds, which accelerate the charge separation capability of the core&#8208;shell photoanode. This study demonstrates the key roles of nanostructure design in improving the efficiency of PEC devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Fe Cationic Vacancies with Graphdiyne to Enhance Exceptional Pseudocapacitive Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne as anode material in Li&#8208;ion batteries can realize effective charge transfer to induce the formation of a high number of Fe vacancies with uniform dispersion. The Fe vacancies modulate charge distribution, serve as active sites and enhance electron&#8208;ion transportation, thereby displaying robust pseudocapacitive behavior. The Fe vacancies also reduce the diffusion energy barrier and adsorption energies, leading to a superior battery performance.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of electrode materials at atomic level is the key to controlling electrodes with outstanding rate capability. On the basis of modulating the iron cationic vacancies (IV) and electronic structure of materials, we proposed the method of preparing graphdiyne/ferroferric oxide heterostructure (IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO) as anode materials. The goal is to motivate lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) toward ultra&#8208;high capacity, superior cyclic stability, and excellent rate performance. The graphdiyne is used as carriers to disperse Fe3O4 uniformly without agglomeration and induce high valence of Fe with reducing the energy in the system. The presence of Fe vacancy could regulate the charge distribution around vacancies and adjacent atoms, leading to facilitate electronic transportation, enlarge the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and decrease Li+ diffusion barriers, and thus displaying significant pseudocapacitive process and advantageous lithium&#8208;ion storage. The optimized electrode IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO reveals a capacity of 2084.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, superior cycle stability and rate performance with a high specific capacity of 1057.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;C.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Phase Reconstruction Enables Robust Zinc Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;phase reconstruction strategy is proposed and applied to commercial zinc foil anodes, which affords continuous protection on the reconstructed anode from dendrite growth and corrosion and evades surface damage induced by inhomogeneous stripping in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are inherently safe, but the severe dendrite growth and corrosion reaction on zinc anodes greatly hinder their practical applications. Most of the strategies for zinc anode modification refer to the research of lithium metal anodes on surface regulation without considering the intrinsic mechanisms of zinc anode. Herein, we first point out that surface modification cannot permanently protect zinc anodes due to the unavoidable surface damage during the stripping process by solid&#8211;liquid conversion. A bulk&#8208;phase reconstruction strategy is proposed to introduce abundant zincophilic sites both on the surface and inside the commercial zinc foils. The bulk&#8208;phase reconstructed zinc foil anodes exhibit uniform surfaces with high zincophilicity even after deep stripping, significantly improving the resistance to dendrite growth and side reactions. Our proposed strategy suggests a promising direction for the development of dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes for practical rechargeable batteries with high sustainability.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Oxide Interfaces with Modified Intermediate Configurations Realizing Nearly 100% CO2 Electrocatalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO is achieved by Ag nanodomains loaded on ZnO porous nanobelts coupled with high electronic conductivity MXene (Ag&#8722;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx). The unique Ti3C2Tx&#8208;regulated Ag&#8722;ZnO interfaces can modulate the formation and configuration of *CO intermediates (eg. linear&#8208; or bridge&#8208;bonded CO), which is suitable for highly selective and efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via renewable electricity provides a sustainable way to produce valued chemicals, while it suffers from low activity and selectivity. Herein, we constructed a novel catalyst with unique Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8722;ZnO interfaces, undercoordinated surface sites, as well as mesoporous nanostructures. The designed Ag&#8722;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx catalyst achieves an outstanding CO2 conversion performance of a nearly 100% CO Faraday efficiency with high partial current density of 22.59&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.87&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The electronic donation of Ag and up&#8208;shifted d&#8208;band center relative to Fermi level within MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8722;ZnO interfaces contributes the high selectivity of CO. The CO2 conversion is highly correlated with the dominated linear&#8208;bonded CO intermediate confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This work enlightens the rational design of unique metal&#8208;oxide interfaces with the regulation of MXene for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Quinoidal Compounds with Good Air Stability and High Electrical Conductivity for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone has been used to develop self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules (QnNs) with high electrical conductivities and good air stability. Intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone was found to result in the self&#8208;doping. Applying the QnNs as the cathode interlayer (CIL) in organic solar cells led to an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 18.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Air stable n&#8208;type conductive molecules with high electrical conductivities and excellent device performance have important applications in organic electronics, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report three self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules, designated QnNs, with a closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone and alkyl amino chains of different lengths. The QnNs are self&#8208;doped by intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone. This process is ascertained unambiguously by experiments and theoretical calculations. The use of a quinoidal structure effectively improves the self&#8208;doping level, and thus increases the electrical conductivity of self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules achieved by a closed&#8208;shell structure from&lt;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 to&gt;0.03&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure results in good air stability of the QnNs, with half&#8208;lives&gt;73&#8197;days; and Q4N shows an electrical conductivity of 0.019&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even after exposure to air for 120&#8197;days. When applying Q6N as the cathode interlayer in organic solar cells (OSCs), an outstanding power conversion efficiency of up to 18.2&#8201;% was obtained, which represents one the best results in binary OSCs.

         <title>A Fluorogenic DNAzyme for A Thermally Stable Protein Biomarker from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Human Bacterial Pathogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusobacterium nucleatum is a pathogenic bacterium associated with many poor human conditions, such as gum disease, adverse pregnancies, and colorectal cancer. An RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, RFD&#8208;FN1, was isolated through in vitro selection to selectively recognize a heat stable biomarker of this bacterium, establishing the opportunity to develop diagnostic platforms for this pathogen.







Abstract
Fusobacterium nucleatum has been correlated to many poor human conditions including oral infections, adverse pregnancies and cancer, and thus molecular tools capable of detecting this human pathogen can be used to develop diagnostic tests for them. Using a new selection method targeting thermally stable proteins without a counter&#8208;selection step, we derived an fluorogenic RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RFD&#8208;FN1, that can be activated by a thermally stable protein target that is unique to F. nucleatum subspecies. High thermal stability of protein targets is a very desirable attribute for DNAzyme&#8208;based biosensing directly with biological samples because nucleases found inherently in these samples can be heat&#8208;inactivated. We further demonstrate that RFD&#8208;FN1 can function as a fluorescent sensor in both human saliva and human stool samples. The discovery of RFD&#8208;FN1 paired with a highly thermal stable protein target presents opportunities for developing simpler diagnostic tests for this important pathogen.

         <title>Reversible Electrodeposition of Potassium&#8208;bridged Molecular Vanadium Oxides: A New Approach Towards Multi&#8208;Electron Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled redox&#8208;driven and K+ cation&#8208;assisted reversible electrodeposition of molecular vanadium oxide clusters is reported as a new approach for multi&#8208;electron storage.







Abstract
Molecular metal oxides, so&#8208;called polyoxometalates (POMs), have shown outstanding performance as catalysts and lately attracted interest as materials in energy conversion and storage systems due to their capability of storing and exchanging multiple electrons. Here, we report the first example of redox&#8208;driven reversible electrodeposition of molecular vanadium oxide clusters, leading to the formation of thin films. The detailed investigation of the deposition mechanism reveals that the reversibility is dependent on the reduction potential. Correlating electrochemical quartz microbalance studies with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data gave insight into the redox chemistry and oxidation states of vanadium in the deposited films in dependence on the potential window. A multi&#8208;electron reduction of the polyoxovanadate cluster, which facilitates the potassium (K+) cation&#8208;assisted reversible formation of potassium vanadium oxide thin films was confirmed. At anodic potentials, re&#8208;oxidation of the polyoxovanadate and complete stripping of the thin film is observed for films deposited at potentials more positive than &#8722;500&#8197;mV vs. Ag/Ag+, while electrodeposition at more negative cathodic potential reduces the electrochemical reversibility of the process and increases the stripping overpotential. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the deposited films for potential use in potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts is promising for wastewater treatment. The effect of linkage chemistry of COFs as functional basis to photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalysis remains a significant challenge. In this study, three kinds of azoles&#8208;linked COFs including thiazole&#8208;linked TZ&#8208;COF, oxazole&#8208;linked OZ&#8208;COF and&#160;imidazole&#8208;linked IZ&#8208;COF were successfully synthesized. More accessible channels of charge transfer were constructed in TZ&#8208;COF via the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure between thiazole linkage and pyrene linker, leading to efficient suppression of photoexcited charge recombination. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental studies, demonstrating that the thiazole linkage is more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages. The real active sites in COFs located at the benzene ring fragment between pyrene unit and azole linkage.</dc:description>

         <title>Locating Hydrogen Positions for COF&#8208;300 by Cryo&#8208;3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen atoms of a covalent organic framework on the framework and guest molecules were located using cryo&#8208;3D electron diffraction for the first time. The host&#8211;guest interactions in the framework material were clarified by locating the hydrogen atoms.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have wide&#8208;ranging applications, and their host&#8211;guest interactions play an essential role in the achievement of COF functions. To investigate these host&#8211;guest interactions, it is necessary to locate all atoms, especially hydrogen atoms. However, it is difficult to determine the hydrogen atomic positions in COFs because of the complexities in synthesizing high&#8208;quality large single crystals. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has unique advantages for the structural determination of nanocrystals and identification of light atoms. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that the hydrogen atoms of a COF, not only on the framework but also on the guest molecule, can be located by 3D ED using continuous precession electron diffraction tomography (cPEDT) under cryogenic conditions. The host&#8211;guest interactions were clarified with the location of the hydrogen atoms. These findings provide novel insights into the investigation of COFs.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Plasticity of Kratom Pseudoindoxyl Metabolites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although opioids have been used in the treatment of pain for centuries, they cause various adverse effects and addiction. Recently, kratom alkaloids emerged as promising analgesic alternatives for pain management with considerably fewer side effects. The first scalable total synthesis of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, the most potent atypical opioid kratom metabolite, is now reported, as well as the discovery of its structural plasticity.







Abstract
Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, a kratom metabolite, has attracted increasing attention due to its favorable side effect profile as compared to conventional opioids. Herein, we describe the first enantioselective and scalable total synthesis of this natural product and its epimeric congener, speciogynine pseudoindoxyl. The characteristic spiro&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;tricyclic system of these alkaloids was formed through a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free cascade relay process in which oxidized tryptamine and secologanin analogues were used. Furthermore, we discovered that mitragynine pseudoindoxyl acts not as a single molecular entity but as a dynamic ensemble of stereoisomers in protic environments; thus, it exhibits structural plasticity in biological systems. Accordingly, these synthetic, structural, and biological studies provide a basis for the planned design of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl analogues, which can guide the development of next&#8208;generation analgesics.

         <title>On the Conformation of Dimeric Acceptors and Their Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimeric&#8208;type acceptors, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized with selenophone and thiophene as a bridge, respectively. Both exhibit O&#8208;shape conformation as determined by NMR and DFT simulations, which is driven by the robust &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of intramolecular terminal groups. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;DIBP3F&#8208;Se&#8208;based solar cell demonstrated an efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%.







Abstract
The determination of molecular conformations of oligomeric acceptors (OAs) and their impact on molecular packing are crucial for understanding the photovoltaic performance of their resulting polymer solar cells (PSCs) but have not been well studied yet. Herein, we synthesized two dimeric acceptor materials, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S, which bridged two segments of Y6&#8208;derivatives by selenophene and thiophene, respectively. Theoretical simulation and experimental 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic studies prove that both dimers exhibit O&#8208;shaped conformations other than S&#8208; or U&#8208;shaped counter&#8208;ones. Notably, this O&#8208;shaped conformation is likely governed by a distinctive &#8220;conformational lock&#8221; mechanism, arising from the intensified intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions among their two terminal groups within the dimers. PSCs based on DIBP3F&#8208;Se deliver a maximum efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, outperforming DIBP3F&#8208;S&#8208;based cells (16.11&#8201;%) and ranking among the highest efficiencies for OA&#8208;based PSCs. This work demonstrates a facile method to obtain OA conformations and highlights the potential of dimeric acceptors for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Bis&#8208;Cyclization of Allenynes for the Synthesis of Strained and Planar Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of naphthalene&#8208;tethered allenynes gave 4H&#8208;cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene (CPP) derivatives. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic reaction of an alkyne with the activated allene to generate a vinyl cation intermediate followed by arylation. Selective formation of CPP and dibenzofluorene derivatives using aryl&#8208;substituted substrates, depending on the reaction conditions, is also presented.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of naphthalene&#8208;tethered allenynes gave strained fused phenanthrene derivatives. The reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic reaction of an alkyne with the activated allene to generate a vinyl cation intermediate, followed by arylation with a tethered naphthalene ring to form the 4H&#8208;cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene (CPP) scaffold. When using aryl&#8208;substituted substrates on the alkyne terminus, the gold&#8208;catalyzed reaction produced dibenzofluorene derivatives along with the CPP derivatives. Selective formation of CPP and dibenzofluorene derivatives depending on the reaction conditions is also presented.

         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;polarization approaches to enhance 1H&#8594;15N magnetization transfer processes involving labile protons are explored, capable of covering the large frequency ranges required to tackle such systems. Strategies based on both phase and frequency&#8208;modulated 1H waveforms are proposed, and their superior performance experimentally verified.







Abstract
INEPT&#8208;based experiments are widely used for 1H&#8594;15N transfers, but often fail when involving labile protons due to solvent exchanges. J&#8208;based cross polarization (CP) strategies offer a more efficient alternative to perform such transfers, particularly when leveraging the Hwater
HN exchange process to boost the 1H&#8594;15N transfer process. This leveraging, however, demands the simultaneous spin&#8208;locking of both Hwater and HN protons by a strong 1H RF field, while fulfilling the &#947;HB1,H=&#947;NB1,N Hartmann&#8208;Hahn matching condition. Given the low value of &#947;N/&#947;H, however, these demands are often incompatible&#8212;particularly when experiments are executed by the power&#8208;limited cryogenic probes used in contemporary high field NMR. The present manuscript discusses CP alternatives that can alleviate this limitation, and evaluates their performance on urea, amino acids, and intrinsically disordered proteins. These alternatives include new CP variants based on frequency&#8208;swept and phase&#8208;modulated pulses, designed to simultaneously fulfill the aforementioned conflicting conditions. Their performances vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis current options are theoretically analyzed with Liouville&#8208;space simulations, and experimentally tested with double and triple resonance transfer experiments.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Solution Synthesis of Graphene Nanoribbons with Precisely Engineered Nanopores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous graphene nanoribbon (pGNR) has been obtained for the first time by bottom&#8208;up solution&#8208;phase synthesis. The key design is to use the tailor&#8208;made polyphenylene precursor bearing pre&#8208;installed hexagonal nanopores, which allows us to access the pGNR with fully conjugated backbone and precisely embedded nanopores. The resultant pGNR present enlarged band gap and enhanced liquid&#8208;phase processability, compared to its nonporous counterparts.







Abstract
The incorporation of nanopores into graphene nanostructures has been demonstrated as an efficient tool in tuning their band gaps and electronic structures. However, precisely embedding the uniform nanopores into graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at the atomic level remains underdeveloped especially for in&#8208;solution synthesis due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Herein we report the first case of solution&#8208;synthesized porous GNR (pGNR) with a fully conjugated backbone via the efficient Scholl reaction of tailor&#8208;made polyphenylene precursor (P1) bearing pre&#8208;installed hexagonal nanopores. The resultant pGNR features periodic subnanometer pores with a uniform diameter of 0.6&#8197;nm and an adjacent&#8208;pores&#8208;distance of 1.7&#8197;nm. To solidify our design strategy, two porous model compounds (1&#8201;a, 1&#8201;b) containing the same pore size as the shortcuts of pGNR, are successfully synthesized. The chemical structure and photophysical properties of pGNR are investigated by various spectroscopic analyses. Notably, the embedded periodic nanopores largely reduce the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and alleviate the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, compared to the nonporous GNRs with similar widths, affording pGNR with a notably enlarged band gap and enhanced liquid&#8208;phase processability.

         <title>Toward a Formyl&#8208;to&#8208;Phenyl Conversion: An Unexpected Photochemical Fulvene Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction sequence toward a conversion of aldehydes into arenes involving a fulvene and a Dewar benzene derivative as intermediates was designed and studied computationally. Irradiation of different fulvenes results in an unusual photoisomerization and leads to spiro[2.4]heptadienes.







Abstract
Toward a conversion of aldehydes into arenes, we designed a sequence involving the initial reaction of an aldehyde to give a fulvene, followed by photochemical and platinum&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements into a Dewar benzene derivative, which finally isomerizes into the targeted arene. While computational studies support the plausibility of this route, we found that fulvene irradiation resulted in an unexpected isomerization into a spiro[2.4]heptadiene. This unusual photorearrangement has been investigated mechanistically and provides access to a variety of spiro[2.4]heptadienes with different substituents.

         <title>Directed Evolution of Piperazic Acid Incorporation by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient directed evolution protocols for nonribosomal peptide synthetases are needed to adapt the structures of antibiotic peptides for the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Here, an easily reproducible directed evolution protocol was used to reprogram the synthetase for the antibiotic peptide gramicidin S. A few mutations were sufficient to incorporate the non&#8208;standard building block piperazic acid instead of proline with perfect specificity.







Abstract
Engineering of biosynthetic enzymes is increasingly employed to synthesize structural analogues of antibiotics. Of special interest are nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) responsible for the production of important antimicrobial peptides. Here, directed evolution of an adenylation domain of a Pro&#8208;specific NRPS module completely switched substrate specificity to the non&#8208;standard amino acid piperazic acid (Piz) bearing a labile N&#8722;N bond. This success was achieved by UPLC&#8208;MS/MS&#8208;based screening of small, rationally designed mutant libraries and can presumably be replicated with a larger number of substrates and NRPS modules. The evolved NRPS produces a Piz&#8208;derived gramicidin S analogue. Thus, we give new impetus to the too&#8208;early dismissed idea that widely accessible low&#8208;throughput methods can switch the specificity of NRPSs in a biosynthetically useful fashion.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkylation of Internal Olefin with Cycloalkanone to Directly Access Polycyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation of unactivated internal olefins with tethered cyclic ketones was realized by the cooperative catalysis of a newly designed chiral amine (SPD&#8208;NH2) and Pd(II) complex, providing straightforward access to either bridged or fused bicyclic systems containing three stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr). Notably, the bicyclic products could be conveniently transformed into a diverse range of key structures frequently found in bioactive terpenes, such as &#8710;6&#8208;protoilludene, cracroson D, and vulgarisins. The steric hindrance between the Ar group of the SPD&#8208;NH2 catalyst and the branched chain of the substrate, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the N&#8208;H of the enamine motif and the C=O of the directing group MQ, and the counterion of the Pd(II) complex were identified as key factors for excellent stereoinduction in this dual catalytic process by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral PSiSi&#8208;Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation offers an efficient approach for the rapid construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, but remains a significant challenge.

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes: Efficient and Simple Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese(I) complexes bearing simple, non&#8208;bifunctional bis(NHC) ligands were investigated as hydrogenation catalysts. Applying these complexes with KHBEt3 as additive, various carboxylic acid esters and, additionally, ketones, nitriles, N&#8208;heteroarenes and alkenes were successfully hydrogenated. Mechanistic investigations by control experiments and DFT calculations indicate an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism and reveal the role of BEt3 as cocatalyst.







Abstract
The use of bis(NHC) manganese(I) complexes&#8197;3 as catalysts for the hydrogenation of esters was investigated. For that purpose, a series of complexes has been synthesized via an improved two step procedure utilizing bis(NHC)&#8208;BEt3 adducts. By applying complexes&#8197;3 with KHBEt3 as additive, various aromatic and aliphatic esters were hydrogenated successfully at mild temperatures and low catalyst loadings, highlighting the efficiency of the novel catalytic system. The versatility of the developed catalytic system was further demonstrated by the hydrogenation of other substrate classes like ketones, nitriles, N&#8208;heteroarenes and alkenes. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicate an inner sphere mechanism with the loss of one CO ligand and reveal the role of BEt3 as cocatalyst.

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;Based Separator with Interfacial Chemistry Regulation for Robust Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K plating/stripping in potassium metal battery is regulated via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework (MOF). These functional units in the separator offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Potassium metal batteries (KMBs) are ideal choices for high energy density storage system owing to the low electrochemical potential and low cost of K. However, the practical KMB applications suffer from intrinsically active K anode, which would bring serious safety concerns due to easier generation of dendrites. Herein, to explore a facile approach to tackle this issue, we propose to regulate K plating/stripping via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework. As a case study, the functional units of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Benefiting from these favorable features, uniform and stable K plating/stripping is realized with the regulated separator. Full battery assembled with the regulated separator showed &#8764;19.9&#8201;% higher discharge capacity than that with glass fiber separator at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and much better cycling stability at high rates. The generality of our approach is validated with KMBs using different cathodes and electrolytes. We envision that the strategy to suppress dendrite formation by commercial separator surface engineering using tailor&#8208;designed functional units can be extended to other metal/metal ion batteries.

         <title>Biselenophene Imide: Enabling Polymer Acceptor with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shortage of narrow bandgap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron&#8208;deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI&#8208;Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI&#8208;Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5&#8208;Br, the resulting A&#8208;A polymer PY5&#8208;BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower bandgap, deeper&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5&#8208;BSe. Consequently, the PY5&#8208;BSeI&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77% with a high short&#8208;circuit current of 24.93 mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 75.83%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70%) of the PY5&#8208;BSe&#8208;based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks offers excellent synthons to develop A&#8208;A type polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs and even beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>The Keto&#8208;Switched Photocatalysis of Reconstructed Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The keto&#8208;switched photocatalysis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient H2 evolution was reported for the first time by engineering at a molecular level the local structure and component of the skeletal building blocks. A series of imine&#8208;linked BT&#8208;COFs were synthesized by the Schiff&#8208;base reaction of 1, 3, 5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde with diamines to demonstrate the structural reconstruction of enol to keto configurations by alkaline catalysis. It was well&#8208;identified that the keto groups of the skeletal building blocks were served as active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons were emitted to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer. The characterization results, together with density functional theory calculations, indicated clearly that the formation of keto&#8208;injectors not only made the conduction band level more negative, but also led to an inhomogeneous charge distribution in the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular building blocks to form a strong intramolecular built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, the visible light photocatalysis of TP&#8208;COFs&#8208;1 with one keto group in the skeletal building blocks was successfully enabled and achieved an impressive H2 evolution rate as high as 0.96 mmol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1. Also, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of the reconstructed BT&#8208;COFs&#8208;2 and &#8208;3 with two and three keto&#8208;injectors were significantly enhanced by the alkaline post&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Chiral Hybrid Antimony Chlorides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are ideal for information anti&#8208;countering applications, but the best&#8208;performing materials have not yet been identified. This work presents enantiomorphic hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (1) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (2) showing mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activity with a dissymmetry factor of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Interestingly, the DMF&#8208;induced structural transformation is realized to obtain non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#183;DMF (3) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#183;DMF (4) upon exposure to DMF vapor. The transformation process is reversed upon heating. DFT calculations showed that the DMF&#8208;induced&#8208;quenched&#8208;luminescence is attributed to the intersection of the ground and excited state curves on the configuration coordinates. Unexpectedly, the nanocrystals of the chiral antimony halides 1 and 2 were prepared and indicate the excellent solution process performance. The reversible PL and CPL switching gives the system applications in information technology, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption&#8208;decryption, and logic gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mn2+&#8211;NO and NO&#8211;NO Distance Measurements Reveal That Catalytic Asymmetry Regulates Alternating Access&#160;
in an ABC Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters shuttle diverse substrates across biological membrane. Transport is often achieved through a transition between an inward&#8208;facing (IF) and an outward&#8208;facing (OF) conformation of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Asymmetric nucleotide&#8208;binding sites (NBSs) are present among several ABC subfamilies and their functional role remains elusive. Here we addressed this question using concomitant NO&#8211;NO, Mn2+&#8211;NO, and Mn2+&#8211;Mn2+&#160;pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy of TmrAB in a time resolved manner. This type&#160;IV ABC transporter undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn2+&#8211;ATP and Mn2+&#160;is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS. ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates reverse transition. Both NBSs fully open during each conformational cycle and the degenerate NBS may regulate the kinetics of this process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose the first regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and chemoselective late&#8208;stage (hetero)aryl C&#8211;H bond cyclopropenylation with cyclopropenium cations (CPCs). The process is fast, operationally simple and showed an excellent functional group tolerance in&#160;densely&#8208;functionalized drug molecules, natural products, agrochemicals and fluorescent dyes.&#160;Moreover, we discovered that the installation of the cyclopropene ring in drug molecules could not only be used to shield against metabolic instability but also as a synthetic tool to&#160;reach medicinally&#8208;relevant&#160;sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds&#160;exploiting&#160;the highly&#8208;strained nature of the cyclopropene ring with known transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Sustainable Metal&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Materials, Electrochemistry and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the natural abundance of iodine, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainability, metal&#8208;iodine batteries are competitive for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density, and large power density. However, the inherent properties of iodine such as electronic insulation and shuttle behavior of soluble iodine species affect negatively rate performance, cyclability, and self&#8208;discharge behavior of metal&#8208;iodine batteries, while the dendrite growth and metal corrosion on the anode side brings potential safety hazards and inferior durability. These problems of metal&#8208;iodine system still exist and need to be solved urgently. Herein, we summarize the research progress of metal&#8208;iodine batteries in the past decades. Firstly, the classification, design strategy and reaction mechanism of iodine electrode are briefly outlined. Secondly, the current development and protection strategy of conventional metal anodes in metal&#8208;iodine batteries are highlighted, and some potential anode materials and their design strategies are proposed. Thirdly, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues for realizing next&#8208;generation iodine&#8208;based energy storage systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to promote the development of metal&#8208;iodine batteries and provide guidelines for their design.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular Design for High&#8208;Performance Molecular Diodes Based on Pyridyl Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving the positions of nitrogen atoms in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of phenypyridyl&#8208;terminated isomers allows the coupling strength between the SAMs and the top electrode to be finely tuned from strong, to modest, to weak coupling. This results in the switching of the isomers from non&#8208;rectifying resistors (rectification ratios, r+=1 at &#177;1.5&#8197;V) to high&#8208;performance molecular diodes (r+=229).

Abstract
A simple method for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl dihydrobenzofurans is reported. This approach leverages the equilibrium between quinone methide dimers and their persistent radicals. This equilibrium is disrupted by phenols that yield comparatively transient phenoxyl radicals, leading to cross&#8208;coupling between the persistent and transient radicals. The resultant quinone methides with pendant phenols rapidly cyclize to form dihydrobenzofurans (DHBs). This putative biomimetic access to dihydrobenzofurans provides superb functional group tolerance and a unified approach for the synthesis of resveratrol&#8208;based natural products.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Response Nickel&#8208;Promoted Indium Oxide Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation from Intermittent Solar Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a distributed CO2 utilization system incorporating a fluctuating H2 supply. Ni loaded on In2O3 reduces the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2. The system exhibits a faster response (12&#8197;min) than bare oxide catalysts (42&#8197;min). Ni enhances the sensitivity of the catalyst to H2, enabling good performance at lower H2 concentrations and adaptability to a wide H2 fluctuation range compared to In2O3.







Abstract
Construction of a &#8220;net&#8208;zero&#8208;emission&#8221; system through CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with solar energy is an eco&#8208;friendly way to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Traditional CO2 hydrogenation demands centralized mass production for cost reduction with mass water electrolysis for hydrogen supply. To achieve continuous reaction with intermittent and fluctuating flow of H2 on a small&#8208;scale for distributed application scenarios, modulating the catalyst interface environment and chemical adsorption capacity to adapt fluctuating reaction conditions is highly desired. This paper describes a distributed clean CO2 utilization system in which the surface structure of catalysts is carefully regulated. The Ni catalyst with unsaturated electrons loaded on In2O3 can reduce the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2 supply, exhibiting a faster response (12&#8197;min) than bare oxide catalysts (42&#8197;min). Moreover, the introduction of Ni enhances the sensitivity of the catalyst to hydrogen, yielding a Ni/In2O3 catalyst with a good performance at lower H2 concentrations with a 15&#8197;times adaptability for wider hydrogen fluctuation range than In2O3, greatly reducing the negative impact of unstable H2 supplies derived from renewable energies.

         <title>Topological Design of Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multiple Anion Functionalities and Hierarchical Porosity for Benchmark Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;8) with znv&#160;topology and SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;9) with wly&#160;topology for efficient capture of C2H2&#160;from CO2&#160;and C2H4. Both ZNU&#8208;8 and ZNU&#8208;9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU&#8208;9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C2H2&#160;capacity (7.94 mmol/g) and a high C2H2/CO2&#160;(10.3) or C2H2/C2H4&#160;(11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C2H2&#160;per anion (4.94 mol/mol at 1 bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF62&#8208;&#160;anions in the confined cavity, which is further confirmed by in&#8208;situ IR spectra. The practical separation performance was explicitly demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments with equimolar C2H2/CO2&#160;mixtures and 1/99 C2H2/C2H4&#160;mixtures under various conditions with excellent recyclability and benchmark&#160;productivity of pure C2H2&#160;(5.13 mmol/g) or C2H4&#160;(48.57 mmol/g).</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors could be used for &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This glycosylation method was applied successfully to the synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanosidic linkage has been in great demand for efficient synthesis of biologically active natural glycosides. In this study, we developed a regioselective and &#946;&#8208;stereospecific d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation promoted by a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions. The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors to give the corresponding &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosides (&#946;&#8208;Arbf) in high yields with complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity and high regioselectivity. The regioselectivity was completely reversed depending on the optical isomerism of the donor used and was predictable a priori using predictive models. Mechanistic studies based on DFT calculations revealed that the present glycosylation occurs through a highly dissociative concerted SNi mechanism. The usefulness of the glycosylation method was demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.

         <dc:description>
A designed transient Lewis pair interaction was found to be the key to facilitate the racemization of 8&#8208;arylquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;formaldehydes and enable an iridium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, accomplished via atroposelective allylation by transfer hydrogenative coupling.







Abstract
An atroposelective Ir&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes/1&#8208;naphthaldehydes by transfer hydrogenative coupling of allyl acetate is disclosed. The allylation reaction takes place with simultaneous installation of central and axial chirality, reaching high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantiomeric excesses when ortho&#8208;cyclometalated iridium&#8208;DM&#8208;BINAP is used as the catalyst. The racemization of the substrates occurs through a designed transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the quinoline nitrogen atom and the aldehyde carbonyl group.

         <title>Robust Proton Conduction against Mechanical Stress in Flexible Free&#8208;Standing Membrane Composed of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricated a highly oriented free&#8208;standing membrane composed of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) with excellent mechanical properties under stress. This is the first study to demonstrate the robust proton conduction of 2D CPs under an applied bending stress. We found that proton conductivity remained almost constant during bending.







Abstract
Introduction of mechanical flexibility into proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymers (CPs) is in high demand for future protonic applications such as fuel cells and hydrogen sensors. Although such mechanical properties have been primarily investigated in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) CPs, in this study, we successfully fabricated highly flexible free&#8208;standing CP membranes with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which is beneficial for enhanced performance in the aforementioned applications. We fabricated a layered CP, Cu2(NiTCPP) (H4(H2TCPP); 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin), in which a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) square grid sheet composed of tetradentate nickel porphyrins and paddlewheel&#8208;type copper dimers was connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The mechanical flexibility was evaluated by bending and tensile tests. The flexural and Young's moduli of the membrane were significantly higher than those of conventional Nafion membranes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the in&#8208;plane proton conductivity of the membrane was maintained even under applied bending stress. Because the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the proton&#8208;conducting pathway through the hydrogen bonding network remains intact during the bending operation, our present study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of new and advanced 2D CPs without using substrates or additional polymers for protonic devices.

         <title>Fused Indacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fused indacene dimer isomers (s&#8208;ID and as&#8208;ID) have been synthesized and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. They both display an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. s&#8208;ID has localized antiaromaticity on the s&#8208;indacene units, while as&#8208;ID shows weak global aromaticity. Additionally, as&#8208;ID has a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap as compared to s&#8208;ID.







Abstract
Polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of two or more directly fused antiaromatic subunits are rare due to their high reactivity. However, it is important to understand how the interactions between the antiaromatic subunits influence the electronic properties of the fused structure. Herein, we present the synthesis of two fused indacene dimer isomers: s&#8208;indaceno[2,1&#8208;a]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (s&#8208;ID) and as&#8208;indaceno[3,2&#8208;b]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene (as&#8208;ID), containing two fused antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or as&#8208;indacene units, respectively. Their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 1H&#8197;NMR/ESR measurements and DFT calculations revealed that both s&#8208;ID and as&#8208;ID have an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. However, while localized antiaromaticity was observed in s&#8208;ID, as&#8208;ID showed weak global aromaticity. Moreover, as&#8208;ID exhibited a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap than s&#8208;ID. All the differences can be attributed to their distinct quinoidal substructures.

         <title>Rotaxane Formation of Multicyclic Polydimethylsiloxane in a Silicone Network: A Step toward Constructing &#8220;Macro&#8208;Rotaxanes&#8221; from High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Axle and Wheel Components</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Macro&#8208;rotaxanes&#8221; which consist of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle and wheel components were constructed by in situ cross&#8208;linking of linear polymers in the presence of multicyclic polymers. Extending the concept of topological trapping to multicyclic showed that multicyclic polymers with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped, with up to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% successfully topologically trapped as macro&#8208;rotaxanes.







Abstract
Rotaxanes consisting of a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle and wheel components (macro&#8208;rotaxanes) have high structural freedom, and are attractive for soft&#8208;material applications. However, their synthesis remains underexplored. Here, we investigated macro&#8208;rotaxane formation by the topological trapping of multicyclic polydimethylsiloxanes (mc&#8208;PDMSs) in silicone networks. mc&#8208;PDMS with different numbers of cyclic units and ring sizes was synthesized by cyclopolymerization of a &#945;,&#969;&#8208;norbornenyl&#8208;functionalized PDMS. Silicone networks were prepared in the presence of 10&#8211;60&#8197;wt&#8201;% mc&#8208;PDMS, and the trapping efficiency of mc&#8208;PDMS was determined. In contrast to monocyclic PDMS, mc&#8208;PDMSs with more cyclic units and larger ring sizes can be quantitatively trapped in the network as macro&#8208;rotaxanes. The damping performance of a 60&#8197;wt&#8201;% mc&#8208;PDMS&#8208;blended silicone network was evaluated, revealing a higher tan &#948; value than the bare PDMS network. Thus, macro&#8208;rotaxanes are promising as non&#8208;leaching additives for network polymers.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Internal Allylic Alkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a study of copper&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of internal allylic carbonates using functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit good regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8242; products, enabling the preparation of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.







Abstract
We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, regioselective, and stereospecific alkylation of unbiased internal allylic carbonates with functionalized alkyl and aryl Grignard reagents. The reactions exhibit high stereospecificity and regioselectivity for either SN2 or SN2&#8242; products under two sets of copper&#8208;catalyzed conditions, which enables the preparation of a broad range of products with E&#8208;alkene selectivity. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the regioselectivity based on the different behaviors of homo&#8208; and heterocuprates.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen Vacancies via Engineering Heterostructured Fe3C/Fe3O4 Catalysts for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective and feasible strategy to engineer oxygen vacancies in situ by constructing a heterojunction of Fe3C/Fe3O4 that enables an &#8220;optimized activation&#8208;desorption&#8221; system for the electrochemical conversion of N2 into NH3. Combined with experimental results and DFT calculations, the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and heterojunction was further elucidated.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions provides an intriguing pathway to convert N2 into NH3. However, significant kinetic barriers of the NRR at low temperatures in desirable aqueous electrolytes remain a grand challenge due to the inert N&#8801;N bond of the N2 molecule. Herein, we propose a unique strategy for in situ oxygen vacancy construction to address the significant trade&#8208;off between N2 adsorption and NH3 desorption by building a hollow shell structured Fe3C/Fe3O4 heterojunction coated with carbon frameworks (Fe3C/Fe3O4@C). In the heterostructure, the Fe3C triggers the oxygen vacancies of the Fe3O4 component, which are likely active sites for the NRR. The design could optimize the adsorption strength of the N2 and NxHy intermediates, thus boosting the catalytic activity for the NRR. This work highlights the significance of the interaction between defect and interface engineering for regulating electrocatalytic properties of heterostructured catalysts for the challenging NRR. It could motivate an in&#8208;depth exploration to advance N2 reduction to ammonia.

Surface&#8208;immobilized, initiator&#8208;modified cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest complexes allow the growth of supramolecular brushes with thicknesses of &gt;100&#8197;nm via atom transfer radical polymerization. The non&#8208;covalent immobilization of the initiator also provides a facile route towards patterned polymer brushes via drop casting of an aqueous solution of an initiator&#8208;modified adamantane derivative onto a CB[7] functionalized substrate.







Abstract
Polymer brushes are densely grafted, chain end&#8208;tethered assemblies of polymers that can be produced via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. Typically, this is accomplished using initiators or chain transfer agents that are covalently attached to the substrate. This manuscript reports an alternative route towards polymer brushes, which involves the use of non&#8208;covalent cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest interactions to surface&#8208;immobilize initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization. These non&#8208;covalent initiators can be used for the surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of a variety of water&#8208;soluble methacrylate monomers to generate supramolecular polymer brushes with film thicknesses of more than 100&#8197;nm. The non&#8208;covalent nature of the initiator also allows facile access to patterned polymer brushes, which can be produced in straightforward fashion by drop&#8208;casting a solution of the initiator&#8208;modified guest molecules onto a substrate that presents the cucurbit[7]uril host.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Cyclopropenes under Lanthanocene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral lanthanocene complex served as a unique catalyst for the asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines, efficiently affording a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives in high yields with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity and without the need for a directing group.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the C2&#8208;symmetric 5,6&#8208;dioxy&#8208;4,7&#8208;trans&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.

         <title>Binuclear Copper(I) Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared emitting (NIR) compounds based on earth&#8208;abundant binuclear CuI complexes is presented. Two &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions are found in their solid&#8208;state structure yielding to doubly locked architectures that help to suppress excited state flattening distortions and quenching. The complexes have been successfully used in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), and unprecedented NIR electroluminescence (EL) with CuI compounds was achieved.







Abstract
Two binuclear heteroleptic CuI complexes, namely Cu&#8722;NIR1 and Cu&#8722;NIR2, bearing rigid chelating diphosphines and &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,5&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole as the bis&#8208;bidentate ligand are presented. The proposed dinuclearization strategy yields a large bathochromic shift of the emission when compared to the mononuclear counterparts (M1&#8211;M2) and enables shifting luminescence into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region in both solution and solid state, showing emission maximum at ca. 750 and 712&#8197;nm, respectively. The radiative process is assigned to an excited state with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) character as demonstrated by in&#8208;depth photophysical and computational investigation. Noteworthy, X&#8208;ray analysis of the binuclear complexes unravels two interligand &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions yielding a doubly locked structure that disfavours flattening of the tetrahedral coordination around the CuI centre in the excited state and maintain enhanced NIR luminescence. No such interaction is present in M1&#8211;M2. These findings prompt the successful use of Cu&#8722;NIR1 and Cu&#8722;NIR2 in NIR light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), which display electroluminescence maximum up to 756&#8197;nm and peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.43&#8201;%. Their suitability for the fabrication of white&#8208;emitting LECs is also demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of NIR electroluminescent devices based on earth&#8208;abundant CuI emitters.

         <title>Mechanochemical Mediated Coexistence of B&#8592;N Coordination and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexistence of hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination under mechanochemical conditions involving organoboron compounds is demonstrated. The mechanochemical conversion was monitored and reported by photoconversion of an alkene into a cyclobutane.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry afforded a photoactive cocrystal via coexisting (B)O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and B&#8592;N coordination. Specifically, solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical ball mill grinding and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding of a boronic acid and an alkene resulted in mixtures of hydrogen&#8208;bonded and coordinated complexes akin to mixtures of noncovalent complexes that can be obtained in solution in equilibria processes. The alkenes of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assembly undergo an intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization in quantitative conversion, effectively reporting the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly processes. Our results suggest that interplay involving noncovalent bonds subjected to mechanochemical conditions can lead to functional solids where, in the current case, the structure composed of the weaker hydrogen bonding interactions predominates.

         <title>Towards a Precise NMR Quantification of Acute Phase Inflammation Proteins from Human Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum show two characteristic signals originating from acute phase glycoprotein glycans, termed GlycA and B. We have unambiguously assigned them to Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. They can be used for the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins in 10&#8211;20&#8197;min. The method is illustrated with serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 patients.







Abstract
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum and plasma show, besides metabolites and lipoproteins, two characteristic signals termed GlycA and B arising from the acetyl groups of glycoprotein glycans from acute phase proteins, which constitute good markers for inflammatory processes. Here, we report a comprehensive assignment of glycoprotein glycan NMR signals observed in human serum, showing that GlycA and GlycB signals originate from Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. Diffusion&#8208;edited NMR experiments demonstrate that signal components can be associated with specific acute phase proteins. Conventionally determined concentrations of acute phase glycoproteins correlate well with distinct features in NMR spectra (R2 up to 0.9422, p&#8208;value &lt;0.001), allowing the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins. Overall, a proteo&#8208;metabolomics NMR signature of significant diagnostic potential is obtained within 10&#8211;20&#8197;min acquisition time. This is exemplified in serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 and cardiogenic shock patients showing significant changes in several acute phase proteins compared to healthy controls.

         <title>Photo Responsive Electron and Proton Conductivity within a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) is constructed from zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as the acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8722;) as the donor. It exhibits photo&#8208;responsive electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer.







Abstract
Rational design of crystalline porous materials with coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer has not yet been reported to date. Herein, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) with zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8722;) as donor to form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer. Three water molecules were situated in the channels to connect with acidic species through hydrogen bonding interactions to give a 3D framework. The continuous &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions along the a axis and the smooth H&#8208;bonding chain along the b axis provide the electron and proton transfer pathways, respectively. After 405&#8197;nm light irradiation, the photogenerated radicals could simultaneously endow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36 with photoswitchable electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer. By single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient absorption spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the switchable conductivity upon irradiation has been demonstrated.

         <title>Titanium Salalen Catalyzed Enantioselective Benzylic Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) Ti salalen complex (R=NO2) was shown to efficiently catalyze enantioselective benzylic hydroxylations with H2O2 as oxidant. Tetralin and indane derivatives are converted to benzylic alcohols with up to 98&#8201;% ee. The overoxidation to ketone is negligible. Epoxidation reactions are similarly effective, with 1&#8208;decene being converted to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% ee, at 0.1&#8197;mol% catalyst loading.







Abstract
The titanium complex of the cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) derived Berkessel&#8208;salalen ligand is a highly efficient and enantioselective catalyst for the asymmetric epoxidation of terminal olefins with hydrogen peroxide (&#8220;Berkessel&#8208;Katsuki catalyst&#8221;). We herein report that this epoxidation catalyst also effects the highly enantioselective hydroxylation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with hydrogen peroxide. Mechanism&#8208;based ligand optimization identified a novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst of the highest efficiency ever reported for asymmetric catalytic benzylic hydroxylation, with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, while overoxidation to ketone is marginal. The novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst also shows enhanced epoxidation efficiency, as evidenced by e.g. the conversion of 1&#8208;decene to its epoxide in 90&#8201;% yield with 94&#8201;% ee, at a catalyst loading of 0.1&#8197;mol&#8208;% only.

         <title>Improved Birefringence Activated by Tetrahedra Decorated with a Single Linear Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve birefringence, namely decorating the tetrahedra with a single linear [S2] unit. Two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5 have been obtained. The introduction of the additional S atoms did not cause changes in the structure, but the optical anisotropy and birefringence were both enhanced greatly.







Abstract
Performance enhancement induced by structural modification has long been the target in materials science fields. Direct evidence to witness the effectivity of one strategy is challenging and necessary. In this work, a tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve the birefringent performance sharply, namely decorating the tetrahedra with a single linear [S2] unit. The strategy was verified by comprehensive characterization of two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5, which crystallize in the same space group, have similar unit cells and the same units arrangements. Theoretical characterization verified that the [GeS5] group has much larger polarization anisotropy than [GeS4], further demonstrated that the linear [S2] led to the sharp birefringence enlargement of K2BaGeS5 (0.19 vs 0.03 of K2BaGeS4). This work provides a new guiding thought to improve the birefringence performance.

Abstract
We disclose a highly regioselective, catalytic one&#8208;step dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic ketones in the presence of 2,3&#8208;dichlorobenzo&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ). The high regioselectivity originates from a phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enolization, selectively affording the thermodynamically preferred enol, followed by the subsequent oxidation event. Our method provides reliable access to several &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.

         <title>Group&#8208;Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (GTPISA) in Non&#8208;polar Media: An Organocatalyzed Route to Block Copolymer Nanoparticles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles are designed by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly at room temperature in n&#8208;heptane. This novel polymerization method (GTPISA) opens new avenues to fabricate self&#8208;stabilized metal&#8208;free and sulphur&#8208;free nanoparticles in non&#8208;polar media for practical uses, e.g. as viscosity modifiers or as lubricants, while at the same time expanding the field of organic catalysis of polymerization.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (GTPISA) in non&#8208;polar media (n&#8208;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis&#8208;benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non&#8208;polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non&#8208;soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non&#8208;polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non&#8208;polar environments.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&amp;gt;50&#8201;&#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate-based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization-induced self-assembly (GTPISA) in non-polar media (&lt;i&gt;n-&lt;/i&gt;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1-methoxy-1-(trimethylsiloxy)-2-methylprop-1-ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis-benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well-defined metal-free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non-polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non-soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&lt;i&gt;-b-&lt;/i&gt;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self-assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non-polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non-polar environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Polymerization of a Side&#8208;Chain Transformable Bulky Acrylamide Monomer and Subsequent Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification for Syntheses of Isotactic Polyacrylate and Polyacrylamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pendant&#8208;transformable bulky acrylamide monomer was designed for the synthesis of a series of isotactic poly(alkyl acrylamide)s and poly(methyl acrylate). The stereospecific radical polymerization of the special monomer was controlled under diluted condition at lower temperature. The pendant underwent subsequent quantitative aminolysis and alcoholysis post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
We report syntheses of isotactic polyacrylate and polyacrylamide via a stereospecific radical polymerization of a pendant&#8208;transformable monomer, acrylamide carrying isopropyl&#8208;substituted ureidosulfonamide (1), followed by post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM). The study in the alcoholysis and aminolysis reactions of the model compound (2) for evaluation of the transformation ability of the electron&#8208;withdrawing pendant group on the repeating unit 1 revealed the following points: the pendant of the polymer became more reactive than that of monomer; the pendant was active enough for aminolysis reaction affording the amide compound quantitatively without additive/catalyst; the addition of a lithium triflate [Li(OTf)] and triethylamine (Et3N) was effective as for promotion of the alcoholysis reaction. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) was quantitatively obtained via the radical polymerization of 1 in the presence of Li(OTf) at 60&#8201;&#176;C and the subsequent addition of methanol along with Et3N. Thus&#8208;obtained PMA showed higher isotacticity [m=74&#8201;%] than that directly obtained via radical polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) (m=51&#8201;%). The isotacticity was further increased as the temperature and monomer concentration were lower, and eventually m was increased up to 93&#8201;%. The aminolysis PPM after the iso&#8208;specific radical polymerization of 1 gave various isotactic polyacrylamides carrying different alkyl pendant groups, including poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).

         <title>Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of hollow nanoreactors with a hollow multishelled structure and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles is reported. The hollow nanoreactors exhibit size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation because of differences in the energy barrier of substrate adsorption and steric hindrance.







Abstract
Mimicking the structures and functions of cells to create artificial organelles has spurred the development of efficient strategies for production of hollow nanoreactors with biomimetic catalytic functions. However, such structure are challenging to fabricate and are thus rarely reported. We report the design of hollow nanoreactors with hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles. Starting from a molecular&#8208;level design strategy, well&#8208;defined hollow multishelled structure phenolic resins (HoMS&#8208;PR) and carbon (HoMS&#8208;C) submicron particles were accurately constructed. HoMS&#8208;C serves as an excellent, versatile platform, owing to its tunable properties with tailored functional sites for achieving precise spatial location of metal nanoparticles, internally encapsulated (Pd@HoMS&#8208;C) or externally supported (Pd/HoMS&#8208;C). Impressively, the combination of the delicate nanoarchitecture and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles endow the pair of nanoreactors with size&#8211;shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation, including high activity and selectivity of Pd@HoMS&#8208;C for small aliphatic substrates and Pd/HoMS&#8208;C for large aromatic substrates. Theoretical calculations provide insight into the pair of nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in energy barrier of substrate adsorption. This work provides guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of hollow nanoreactors with precisely located active sites and a finely modulated microenvironment by mimicking the functions of cells.

         <title>Dynamic Zn/Electrolyte Interphase and Enhanced Cation Transfer of Sol Electrolyte for All&#8208;Climate Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin nanosheets of zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive of aqueous zinc metal batteries. The nanosheets not only bring a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. The enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase remarkably improve the electrochemical performance of Zn||LiMn2O4 in all climates.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of the promising anodes of aqueous batteries possesses notable advantages, but it faces severe challenges from severe side reactions and notorious dendrite growth. Here, ultrathin nanosheets of &#945;&#8208;zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive. The nanosheets not only create a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. Benefited from the enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase, the pouch cells of Zn||LiMn2O4 using this electrolyte remarkably improve electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, i.e. Zn powders as the Zn anode, high mass loading, and wide temperatures. The results expand the materials available for this dynamic interphase, provide an insightful understanding of the enhanced charge transfer in the electrolyte, and realize the combination of dynamic interphase and enhanced kinetics for all&#8208;climate performance.

         <title>Oxidation of 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin: Its Generality and Novelty as an Oxaporphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin from the 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic neutral state into 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication state was achieved by blocking the reactive pyrrolic &#946;&#8208;positions with aryl groups. The dication was further converted into dipyrrindione by a ring&#8208;opening reaction, as also observed in the oxidation of verdoheme into biliverdin in the heme catabolism, thus consolidating the participation of an oxaporphyrinium cation species.







Abstract
5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin (DOP) is a novel meso&#8208;oxaporphyrin analogue and exhibits unique 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromaticity, unlike its mother congener of 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin, commonly known as its cationic iron complex called verdohem, which is a key intermediate of heme catabolism. To reveal its reactivities and properties as an oxaporphyrin analogue, the oxidation of tetra&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylated DOP (DOP&#8208;Ar4) was explored in this study. Stepwise oxidation from the 20&#960;&#8208;electron neutral state was achieved, and the corresponding 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation and 18&#960;&#8208;electron dication were characterized. Further oxidation of the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication resulted in the formation of a ring&#8208;opened dipyrrindione product by hydrolysis. Considering a similar reaction of verdoheme to ring&#8208;opened biliverdin in the heme degradation in nature, the current result consolidates the ring&#8208;opening reactivity of oxaporphyrinium cation species.

Abstract
Recombination of free charges in organic semiconductors reduces the available photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;carriers and restricts photovoltaic efficiency. In this work, the chiral organic semiconductors (Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S with enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208; chiral alkyl sidechains) are designed and synthesized, which show effective aggregation&#8208;induced chirality through mainchain packing with chiral conformations in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups with tilt chirality. Based on the analysis of spin&#8208;injection, magnetic&#8208;hysteresis loop, and thermodynamics and dynamics of the excited state, we suggest that the aggregation&#8208;induced chirality can generate spin&#8208;polarization, which suppresses charge recombination and offers more available charge&#8208;carriers within Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S relative to the achiral counterpart (Y6). Then the chiral Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S show enhanced catalytic activity with optimal average hydrogen evolution rates of 205 and 217&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, 60&#8211;70&#8201;% higher than Y6, when they are employed as nanoparticle photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light, AM1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Cleavage of Carbon Dioxide C=O Bond Promoted by Nickel&#8208;Boron Cooperativity in a PBP&#8208;Ni Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected reactivity promoted by the ability of the PBP ligand to cooperate with the metal center is observed after the insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe. The overall process involves a complex reaction with the participation of NiII/NiI/Ni0 species that ultimately results in the formation of a nickel cluster with butterfly structure.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of (tBuPBP)Ni(OAc) (5) by insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe (1) is presented. An unexpected CO2 cleavage process involving the formation of new B&#8722;O and Ni&#8722;CO bonds leads to the generation of a butterfly&#8208;structured tetra&#8208;nickel cluster (tBuPBOP)2Ni4(&#956;&#8208;CO)2 (6). Mechanistic investigation of this reaction indicates a reductive scission of CO2 by O&#8208;atom transfer to the boron atom via a cooperative nickel&#8208;boron mechanism. The CO2 activation reaction produces a three&#8208;coordinate (tBuP2BO)Ni&#8208;acyl intermediate (A) that leads to a (tBuP2BO)&#8722;NiI complex (B) via a likely radical pathway. The NiI species is trapped by treatment with the radical trap (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) to give (tBuP2BO)NiII(&#951;2&#8208;TEMPO) (7). Additionally, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis using 13C&#8208;enriched CO2 provides information about the species involved in the CO2 activation process.

         <title>A Targeting Singlet Oxygen Battery for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Deep&#8208;Tissue Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is dependent on externally applied light and oxygen, and the depth of penetration of these factors can be insufficient for the treatment of deep infections. The short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also limit the antibacterial efficiency of PDT. Herein, we designed a targeted singlet oxygen delivery system, CARG&#8208;Py, for irradiation&#8208;free and oxygen&#8208;free PDT. This system was converted to the &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; CARG&#8208;1O2 and released singlet oxygen without external irradiation or oxygen. CARG&#8208;1O2 is composed of pyridones coupled to a targeting peptide that improves the utilization of singlet oxygen in deep multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. CARG&#8208;1O2 was shown to damage DNA, protein, and membranes by increasing the level of reactive oxygen inside bacteria; the attacking of multiple biomolecular sites caused the death of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An in vivo study in a MRSA&#8208;infected mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated the potential of CARG&#8208;1O2 for the efficient treatment of deep infections. This work provides a new strategy to improve traditional PDT for irradiation&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;free treatment of deep infections while improving convenience of PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Microporous Polymer for a Wittig Reaction Cycle in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wittig reaction is a key step in industrial processes to synthesise large quantities of vitamin A and various other important chemicals that are used in daily life. This article presents a pathway to achieve the Wittig reaction in a solid network. A highly porous triphenylphosphine&#8208;based polymer was applied as solid Wittig reagent which underwent, in a multi&#8208;step cycle, in total six post&#8208;synthetic modifications. This allowed to regenerate the solid Wittig reagent and reuse it for the same reaction cycle again. Of particular industrial relevance is that the newly developed material also enables a simple way of separating the product by filtration. Therefore, additional costly and difficult separation and purification steps are no longer needed.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Soluble Diketopyrrolopyrrole Chromophore Stacks from a Series of Pd(II)&#8208;based Ravels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to engineer the stacking of diketopyrropyrrole (DPP) dyes based on non&#8208;statistical metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assembly is introduced. Therefore, the DPP backbone is equipped with nitrogen&#8208;based donors that allow for different discrete assemblies to be formed upon addition of Pd(II), distinguished by the number of &#960;&#8208;stacked chromophores. A Pd3L6 three&#8208;ring, a heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8217;2 ravel composed of two crossing DPPs (flanked by two carbazoles), and two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs (a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack), were obtained and systematically investigated. With increasing counts of stacked chromophores, UV&#8208;Vis absorptions red&#8208;shift and emission intensities decrease, except for compound Pd2L2L&#8217;2 which stands out with an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 52%. This is extraordinary for open&#8208;shell metal containing assemblies and explainable by an intra&#8208;assembly FRET process. The modular design and synthesis of soluble multi&#8208;chromophore building blocks opens potential for the preparation of nanodevices and materials with applications in sensing, photo&#8208;redox catalysis and optics.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8211;H Carbonylation of Light and Heavy Hydrocarbons with Carbon Monoxide via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalysis in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their abundance in organic molecules, considerable limitations still exist in synthetic methods that target the direct C&#8211;H functionalization at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C&#8211;H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C&#8211;H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.</dc:description>

Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas-liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defluorinative&#160;Multi&#8208;Functionalization of Fluoroaryl Sulfoxides Enabled by Fluorine&#8208;Assisted Temporary Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its unique physical properties, fluorine is often used to open up new reaction channels. In this report, we establish a cooperation of [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement and fluorine&#8208;assisted temporary dearomatization for arene multi&#8208;functionalization. Specifically, the [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement of fluoroaryl sulfoxides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles generates an intriguing dearomatised sulfonium species which is short&#8208;lived but exhibits unusually high electrophilicity and thus can be instantly trapped by nucleophiles and dienes at a remarkably low temperature (&#8722;95 &#176;C) to produce four types of valuable multi&#8208;functionalized benzenes, respectively, involving appealing processes of defluorination, desulfurization, and sulfur shift. Mechanistic studies indicate that the use of fluorine on arenes not only circumvents the generally inevitable [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement but also impedes the undesired rearomatization process, thus provides a precious space for constructing and elaborating the temporarily dearomatised fluorinated sulfonium species.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Electrode Materials for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tremendous progress has been made in the field of electrochemical energy storage devices that rely on potassium&#8208;ions as charge carriers due to their abundant resources and excellent ion transport properties. Nevertheless, future practical developments not only count on advanced electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance, but also on competitive costs of electrodes for scalable production. In the past few decades, advanced carbon materials have attracted great interest due to their low cost, high selectivity, and structural suitability and have been widely investigated as functional materials for potassium&#8208;ion storage. This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly developing field, focusing on recent advanced and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, we also discuss recent achievements of dual&#8208;ion batteries and conversion&#8208;type K&#8208;X (X = O2, CO2, S, Se, I2) batteries towards potential practical applications as high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;power devices, and summarize carbon&#8208;based materials as the host for K&#8208;metal protection and possible directions for the development of potassium energy&#8208;related devices as well. Based on this, we bridge the gaps between various carbon&#8208;based functional materials structure and the related potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, especially provide guidance on carbon material design principles for next&#8208;generation potassium&#8208;ion storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High&#8208;Performing Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;based batteries such as Li/Cl2 batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl&#8208;based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well&#8208;documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl&#8208;based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl&#8208;based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl&#8208;based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl2 full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809 Wh/kg&#160;and 4,277 W/kg, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of DNA&#8208;encoded Artificial Cells Boosts Signal Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life&#8208;like hierarchical architecture shows great potential for advancing intelligent biosensing, but modular expansion of its sensitivity and functionality remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, we discovered that a DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell with a liquid core (LAC) can enhance peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Hemin and its DNA G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer complex (DGAH) without substrate&#8208;selectivity, unlike its gelled core (GAC) counterpart. The LAC is easily engineered as an ultrasensitive biosensing system, benefiting from DNA's high programmability and unique signal amplification capability mediated by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. As proof of concept, its versatility was successfully demonstrated by coupling with two molecular recognition elements to monitor tumor&#8208;related microRNA and profile cancer cell phenotypes. This scalable design philosophy offers new insights into the design of next generation of artificial cells&#8208;based biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>From tethered to freestanding stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;protein interactions via fragment linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. However, the systematic discovery of PPI stabilizers remains a largely unmet challenge. Here we report a fragment&#8208;linking approach targeting the interface of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and an ER&#945;&#8208;derived peptide. Two classes of fragments &#8211; a covalent and a non&#8208;covalent &#8211; were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a non&#8208;covalent hybrid molecule where the original fragment interactions were largely conserved. Supported by twenty crystal structures, this initial hybrid molecule was further optimized, resulting in selective, 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; interaction. The high&#8208;resolution structures of both the single fragments, their co&#8208;crystal structures and those of the linked fragments document a feasible strategy to develop orthosteric PPI stabilizers by linking to an initial tethered fragment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo.&#160;This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25 cm2), demonstrating the advantage of the MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for the energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are&#160;the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V), Fe single atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89 V ) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate&#8208;limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction.

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diradicaloid helicenes constructed formally by non&#8208;benzenoid double &#960;&#8208;extension of phenanthrene were synthesized by a common strategy involving double electrophilic benzannulation. Steric effects in the second benzannulation step led to considerable structural diversity among the products, yielding a symmetrical dinor[7]helicene 1 and two isomeric unsymmetrical double helicenes 2 and 3, containing a nor[5]helicene and [4]helicene fragment, respectively, in addition to a common nor[6]helicene motif. Geometries, configurational dynamics, and electronic structure of these helicenes were analyzed using solid&#8208;state structures, spectroscopic methods, and computational analyses. The open&#8208;shell character of the singlet states of these helicenes increases in the order 3 &lt; 1 &lt; 2, with strongly varying diradicaloid indexes and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Compounds 1&#8211;3 displayed narrow optical gaps of 0.79&#8211;1.25 eV, resulting in significant absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region. They also exhibit reversible redox chemistry, each of them yielding stable radical cations, radical anions, and dianions, in some cases possessing intense NIR absorptions extending beyond 2500 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic and Cathodic Platinum Dissolution Processes Involve Different Oxide Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt dissolves transiently during formation and reduction of ultrathin Pt surface oxides, leading to deterioration of Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction electrocatalysts in fuel cells. We observe the formation of two specific Pt surface oxides on Pt(100) and determine their atomic&#8208;scale structure. Pt dissolution during oxidation can be linked to growth of the inner stripe&#8208;like oxide; dissolution during oxide reduction involves the outer amorphous oxide.







Abstract
The degradation of Pt&#8208;containing oxygen reduction catalysts for fuel cell applications is strongly linked to the electrochemical surface oxidation and reduction of Pt. Here, we study the surface restructuring and Pt dissolution mechanisms during oxidation/reduction for the case of Pt(100) in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 by combining operando high&#8208;energy surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry, and density functional theory. Our atomic&#8208;scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe&#8208;like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO2 and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe&#8208;like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential&#8208;independent after the stripe&#8208;like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.

Our atomic-scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe-like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe-like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential-independent after the stripe-like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420 mAh g&#8208;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B. multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X. innexi. In turn, the X. innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B. multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B. multivorans and X. innexi through MV exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving are designed providing a generalized concept, resulting in a novel CAPode system with a high rectification ratio (RRII, 96.29&#8201;%) and an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;,&#8216;AND&#8217;). This work provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.







Abstract
Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy&#8208;efficient and nature&#8208;inspired next&#8208;generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable&#8208;unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub&#8208;nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29&#8201;%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;, &#8216;AND&#8217;). This work demonstrates CAPodes as a generalized concept to achieve p&#8208;n and n&#8208;p analogue junctions based on selective ion electrosorption, provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step method for highly enantioselective C3&#8208;allylation reactions of pyridines was developed. The method involved borane&#8208;catalyzed dearomative pyridine hydroboration, palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dearomatized intermediate, and finally oxidation by air. The method was applicable to a broad range of pyridines, N&#8208;heteroarenes, and allylic esters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot method for enantioselective C&#8722;H allylation of pyridines at C3 via tandem borane and palladium catalysis. This method involves borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration to generate dihydropyridines, then palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dihydropyridines with allylic esters, and finally air oxidation of the allylated dihydropyridines to afford the products. This method enables the introduction of an allylic group at C3 with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

The STNSP@ELE strategy, employing 2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in situ, overcome immunosuppression and enhance chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This study not only demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of the STNSP&#8208;based nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy for immunosuppressive tumors but also establishes general platforms for 2D nanomaterial&#8208;mediated cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment (TME), yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immuno&#8208;oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), a small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and ELE are capable of polarizing the tumor&#8208;supportive M2&#8208;like TAMs into a tumor&#8208;suppressive M1&#8208;like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to boost antitumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intratumoral ratio of M1/M2&#8208;like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust antitumor response. Our study not only demonstrates that the STNSP@ELE chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanoplatform has immune&#8208;modulatory capabilities that can overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors, but also highlights the promise of this nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy in developing other nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics and treating various types of immunosuppressive tumors.

         <title>Polymerizable Solvent&#8208;free Organic Liquids: A New Approach for Large Area Flexible and Foldable Luminescent Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polymerizable solvent&#8208;free organic liquid approach has been introduced to overcome the inherent limitations of organic liquid emitters. On&#8208;surface thermochemical polymerization of the hybrid liquids results in flexible&amp;foldable large&#8208;area luminescent films. Our strategy is well suited for developing tunable and white light&#8208;emitting free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area flexible and transparent films suitable for futuristic applications.







Abstract
The high demand for light&#8208;emitting and display devices made luminescent organic materials as attractive candidates. Solvent&#8208;free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large&#8208;area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent&#8208;free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free liquid emitters enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non&#8208;sticky, flexible, foldable, and free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light&#8208;emitting films using polymerizable solvent&#8208;free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Thin Films as Ideal Matrices for Azide Photolysis in Vacuum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the photo&#8208;mediated reactions of azides in well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;(Da&#8208;SBDC) SURMOF matrices using a solvent&#8208;free approach the initial formation of the nitrene intermediate is shown to be followed by an intramolecular amination yielding an indoloindole. This work offers a novel strategy for precisely controlled chemical transformations of matrix&#8208;isolated azides in crystalline surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs).







Abstract
Studies on reactions in solutions are often hampered by solvent effects. In addition, detailed investigation on kinetics is limited to the small temperature regime where the solvent is liquid. Here, we report the in situ spectroscopic observation of UV&#8208;induced photochemical reactions of aryl azides within a crystalline matrix in vacuum. The matrices are formed by attaching the reactive moieties to ditopic linkers, which are then assembled to yield metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs). These porous, crystalline frameworks are then used as model systems to study azide&#8208;related chemical processes under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, where solvent effects can be safely excluded and in a large temperature regime. Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) allowed us to monitor the photoreaction of azide in SURMOFs precisely. The in situ IRRAS data, in conjunction with XRD, MS, and XPS, reveal that illumination with UV light first leads to forming a nitrene intermediate. In the second step, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs, yielding an indoloindole derivative. These findings unveil a novel pathway for precisely studying azide&#8208;related chemical transformations. Reference experiments carried out for solvent&#8208;loaded SURMOFs reveal a huge diversity of other reaction schemes, thus highlighting the need for model systems studied under UHV conditions.

         <title>Adamantoid Scaffolds for Multiple Cargo Loading and Cellular Delivery as &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trioxaadamantanes derived from inositol orthoesters, containing three conjugatable sites, form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). Three drug molecules could be attached per adamantoid scaffold through enzyme&#8208;labile linkages and a successful drug delivery to HeLa cells as their &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion complexes was demonstrated.







Abstract
There is huge demand for developing guests that bind &#946;&#8208;CD and can conjugate multiple cargos for cellular delivery. We synthesized trioxaadamantane derivatives, which can conjugate up to three cargos per guest. 1H NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed these guests form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;CD with association constants in the order of 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Co&#8208;crystallization of &#946;&#8208;CD with guests yielded crystals of their 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes as determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In all cases, trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside. We established biocompatibility using representative candidate G4 and its inclusion complex with &#946;&#8208;CD (&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells. We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine&#8208;conjugated G4 and established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. For functional assay, we incubated HeLa cells with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;inclusion complexes of G4&#8208;derived prodrugs G6 and G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin. &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 showed higher cytotoxicity than G7, camptothecin, G6 and &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high&#8208;density loading and cargo delivery.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of an Anionic Diazoolefin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic diazoolefin was synthesized. It was found to display a distinct reactivity as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. Furthermore, it can act as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand for metal complexes.







Abstract
Bent (hetero)allenes such as carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes can act as neutral C&#8208;donor ligands, and diverse applications in coordination chemistry have been reported. N&#8208;Heterocyclic diazoolefins are heterocumulenes, which can function in a similar fashion as L&#8208;type ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the reactivity of an anionic diazoolefin. This compound displays distinct reactivity compared to neutral diazoolefins, as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. The anionic diazoolefin can be employed as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand in salt metathesis reactions with metal halide complexes. Extrusion of dinitrogen was observed in a reaction with PCl(NiPr2)2, resulting in a stable phosphinocarbene.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for recording residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) by NMR spectroscopy is reported by Lo&#239;c Salmon, Christoph Giese and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202305120). The medium relies on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli, is compatible with harsh experimental conditions and allows RDC measurements for proteins, nucleic acids and small organic molecules.

         <dc:description>
Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructured nanocrystals are reported by Ken&#8208;ichi Otake, Susumu Kitagawa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303903). These nanocrystals combine soft porosity and electrical properties into a single material. They exhibit semiconductive soft porous interfaces that connect a flexible core and a chemiresistive shell. The cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF nanocrystals demonstrate enhanced selective sorption towards CO2, as well as readable softness, electrical gating, and &#8220;shape memory&#8221; effects for the guest&#8208;responsive iMOF core.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles with Universal Dispersibility through Crown Ether Surface Coordination for Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis and Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is critical for their availability and processibility. In their Communication (e202303280), Hang Xing et&#8197;al. report a crown ether surface coordination approach that enables the universal suspension of various MOF powders into immiscible polar and nonpolar solvents, exhibiting exceptional dispersibility without compromising the accessible voids. The crown ether&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit potential as effective phase&#8208;transfer catalysts and enable the fabrication of uniform membranes with improved performances.

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#160;(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2&#160;(100) surface. This ordered water layer creates a key&#8208;lock H&#8208;bond pattern with the underlying surface hydroxyl groups, hindering the interactions with liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water, as reported by Lorenzo Agosta, Kersti Hermansson et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202303910). We acknowledge Virginia Carnevali for her help with the cover image.

         <title>Twisted Diindeno&#8208;Fused Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene Derivatives and their Dianions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituents of different sizes have been used to synthesize diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity. The twisting of the neutral antiaromatic compounds led to them being endowed with chirality, as well as enhanced energy gaps with decreased diradical character. Furthermore, the doubly reduced species exhibited global aromaticity and decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity.







Abstract
We report a facile synthesis of diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives (DIDBA&#8208;2Cl, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph, and DIDBA&#8208;2H) with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity using three substituents (chloro, phenyl, and hydrogen) of various sizes. The planarization of their cores, as evidenced by the decreased end&#8208;to&#8208;end torsional angles, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their enhanced energy gaps with twisting were investigated by a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods with density functional theory, which showed a transition from singlet open&#8208;shell to closed&#8208;shell configuration. Moreover, their doubly reduced states, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph2&#8722; and DIDBA&#8208;2H2&#8722;, were achieved by chemical reduction. The structures of dianions were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which elucidated that the electron charging further distorted the backbones. The electronic structure of the dianions was demonstrated by experimental and theoretical approaches, suggesting decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity, different from the neutral species.

         <title>Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits remarkable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in the conversion of aminal to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA), an important precursor for polyurethane production. External Br&#248;nsted acid sites convert aminal to aminobenzylaniline, whereas 1D cage&#8208;like micropores induces self&#8208;assembly of two linear para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline molecules and their bimolecular conversion into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDAs.







Abstract
In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8&#8208;fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.

         <title>Dynamic Cages &#8208; Towards Nanostructured Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in capsular assemblies such as dynamic organic and coordination cages has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural variability, these systems have found applications in diverse fields of research, including energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, molecular recognition, and live&#8208;cell imaging. In the exploration of the potential of these discrete architectures, they are increasingly being employed in the formation of more complex systems and smart materials. This Review highlights the most promising pathways to overcome common drawbacks of cage systems (stability, recovery) and discusses the most promising strategies for their hybridization with systems featuring various dimensionalities. Following the description of the most recent advances in the fabrication of zero to three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;based systems, this Review will provide the reader with the structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the employed cages and the properties of the materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Inorganic Click Reaction for the Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the use of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of a new class of inorganic rotaxanes containing gold(I) triazaphosphole stoppers. Electron&#8208;deficient bis&#8208;azides, which thread perethylated pillar[5]arene in aromatic solvents, readily react with two equivalents of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to afford interlocked molecules via an inorganic click reaction. These transformations proceed in good yields (ca. 65%) and in the absence of a catalyst. The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions. The targeted rotaxanes were characterized by multi&#8208;element nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass&#8208;spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET, derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U&#8208;body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF&#8208;induced MET&#8208;phosphorylation. Using the U&#8208;body constructs, their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U&#8208;bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation&#8208;promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso&#8208;grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein&#8208;based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated dicarbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form CoPor&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT &gt; Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT &gt; Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reforming the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase by nanoscale structure regulation for stable lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active Li and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430 Wh kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173 cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.</dc:description>

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra&#8208;low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high&#8208;level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst, a 24&#8208;fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74 %) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component peptide stapling is an appealing method for preparing enzymatically stable peptides with incorporated biologically relevant tags. An unprecedented approach, utilising the tryptophan&#8208;mediated multicomponent Petasis reaction (TMPR), facilitates the generation of stapled peptides and enables their late&#8208;stage functionalisation. A variety of examples are presented to highlight the advantages of the method.







Abstract
Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell&#8208;penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan&#8216;s indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling has been limited as compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan&#8208;mediated Petasis reaction. This method enables the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides and is applicable to both solution and solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Importantly, the use of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan facilitates the formation of stapled peptides in a straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing the formation of undesired by&#8208;products.

     alt="Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late-Stage Functionalisation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-component peptide stapling is an appealing method for preparing enzymatically stable peptides with incorporated biologically relevant tags. An unprecedented approach, utilising the tryptophan-mediated multicomponent Petasis reaction (TMPR), facilitates the generation of stapled peptides and enables their late-stage functionalisation. A variety of examples are presented to highlight the advantages of the method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell-penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan&#8216;s indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling has been limited as compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan-mediated Petasis reaction. This method enables the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides and is applicable to both solution and solid-phase synthesis. Importantly, the use of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan facilitates the formation of stapled peptides in a straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing the formation of undesired by-products. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient and diverse late-stage peptide modifications, thereby enabling rapid production of numerous conjugates for biological and medicinal applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reprocessible Triketoenamine&#8208;Based Vitrimers with Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triketoenamine&#8208;based dynamic covalent network was developed that is dual&#8208;recyclable: by mechanical reprocessing and chemically recycled in a closed loop. The work sheds light on the future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.







Abstract
Development of thermosets that can be repeatedly recycled via both chemical route (closed&#8208;loop) and thermo&#8208;mechanical process is attractive and remains an imperative task. In this work, we reported a triketoenamine based dynamic covalent network derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and secondary amines. The resulting triketoenamine based network does not have intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thus reducing its &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, lowering the stability of the tautomer structure, and enabling its dynamic feature. By virtue of the highly reversible bond exchange, this novel dynamic covalent bond enables the easy construction of highly crosslinked and chemically reprocessable networks from commercially available monomers. The as&#8208;made polymer monoliths exhibit high mechanical properties (tensile strength of 79.4&#8197;MPa and Young's modulus of 571.4&#8197;MPa) and can undergo a monomer&#8208;network&#8208;monomer (yields up to 90&#8201;%) recycling mediated by an aqueous solution, with the new&#8208;generation polymer capable of restoring the material strength to its original state. In addition, owing to its dynamic nature, a catalyst&#8208;free and low&#8208;temperature reprogrammable covalent adaptable network (vitrimer) was achieved. The design concept reported herein can be applied to the development of other novel vitrimers with high repressibility and recyclability, and sheds light on future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Bismuth Nanoclusters Sites Activated by Atomically Dispersed Bismuth for Tandem Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based electrocatalysts composed of bismuth nanoclusters and atomically dispersed bismuth is prepared for highly selective electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction into hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms, demonstrating synergistic catalysis between single&#8208;atomic sites and nanoclusters.







Abstract
Constructing electrocatalysts with p&#8208;block elements is generally considered rather challenging owing to their closed d shells. Here for the first time, we present a p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based (Bi&#8208;based) catalyst with the co&#8208;existence of single&#8208;atomic Bi sites coordinated with oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) atoms and Bi nanoclusters (Biclu) (collectively denoted as BiOSSA/Biclu) for the highly selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As a result, BiOSSA/Biclu gives a high H2O2 selectivity of 95&#8201;% in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode, and a large current density of 36&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.15&#8197;V vs. RHE, a considerable H2O2 yield of 11.5&#8197;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with high H2O2 Faraday efficiency of &#8764;90&#8201;% at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE and a long&#8208;term durability of &#8764;22&#8197;h in H&#8208;cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOSSA/Biclu, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms. This work demonstrates a new synergistic tandem strategy for advanced p&#8208;block&#8208;element Bi catalysts featuring atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites, and the great potential of rational material design for constructing highly active electrocatalysts based on p&#8208;block metals.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (Fe(II)) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8208;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8208;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#9679;&#8208;, H2O2, and HO&#9679;) in Fe(II) oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#9679;&#8208;) in the oxidation of Fe(II) by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8208;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#9679;&#8208; may be expressed as d[CO3&#9679;&#8208;]/dt = [Fe(II)[[O2][HCO3&#8208;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#9679;&#8208; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistor Based on Hydrophobic Polymer Tuned by Ionic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic conjugated polymers have poor ionic transport property, so hydrophilic side chains are often grafted for their application as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, this modification lowers their charge transport ability. Here, an ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport while retaining the charge transport ability of the polymers. By using the ionic gels comprising gel matrix and ionic liquids as the interfacial layers, the hydrophobic polymer achieves the OECT feature with high transconductance, low threshold voltage, high current on/off ratio, short switching time, and high operational stability. The working mechanism is also revealed. Moreover, the OECT performance can be tuned by varying the types and ratios of ionic gels. With the proposed ionic gel strategy, OECTs can be effectively realized with hydrophobic conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, by combining N,&#160;N',&#160;N',&#160;N'''&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl))tetrakis(hydroxylamine)and terephthaladehyde via a polycondensation reaction. The formation of the nitrone functionality was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 13C multi cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy of the 13C&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled COF&#8208;115 and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The permanent porosity of COF&#8208;115 was evaluated through low&#8208;pressure N2, CO2, and H2 sorption experiments. Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF&#8208;115 and the isoreticular imine&#8208;linked COF indicated a superior potential of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF&#8208;115 to the associated amide&#8208;linked material was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF-115 and the isoreticular imine-linked COF indicated a superior potential of N-oxide-based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF-115 to the associated amide-linked material was successfully demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Generic Platform for Upcycling Polystyrene to Aryl Ketones and Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polystyrene (PS) is one of the least recycled large&#8208;volume commodity plastics due to bulkiness of foam products and associated contaminants. PS recycling is also severely hampered by the lack of financial incentive, limited versatility, and poor selectivity of existing methods. To this end, herein we report a thermochemical recycling strategy of &#8220;degradation&#8208;upcycling&#8221; to synthesize a library of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals from PS wastes with high versability and selectivity. Two cascade reactions are selected to first degrade PS into benzene under mild temperatures, followed by the derivatization thereof utilizing a variety of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chloride additives. To demonstrate the versatility, nine ketones and sulfides of cosmetic and pharmaceutical relevance were prepared, including propiophenone, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide. The approach is also amenable to sophisticated upcycling reaction designs and can produce desired products stepwise. The facile and versatile approach will provide a scalable and profitable methodology for upcycling PS waste into value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of d&#8208;Band Centers in Localized CdS Homojunctions through Facet Control for Improved Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accelerated kinetic behaviour of charge carrier transfer and its unhindered surface reaction dynamic process involving oxygenated&#8208;intermediate activation and conversion are urgently required in photocatalytic water (H2O) overall splitting, which has not been nevertheless resolved yet. Herein, localized CdS homojunctions with optimal collocation of high and low index facets to regulate d&#8208;band center for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates (*&#8208;OH and *&#8208;O) have been achieved in H2O overall splitting into hydrogen. Density functional theory, hall effect, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy confirm that, electrons and holes are kinetically transferred to reductive high index facet (002) and oxidative low index facet (110) of the localized CdS homojunction induced by facet Fermi level difference to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, along with a solar conversion into hydrogen (STH) of 2.20% by Air Mass 1.5 Global filter irradiation. These findings contribute to solving the kinetic bottleneck issues of photocatalytic H2O splitting, which will further enhance STH.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Natural and Artificial Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many terpenoids with isoprene unit(s) demonstrating critical biological activities have been isolated and characterized. Although there are natural and many artificial methods for their syntheses, there is a great demand for better understanding of the corresponding structure&#8208;activity relationship, efficiency, and diversity. In this work, we have developed a robust chem&#8208;stamp strategy for the construction of the key isoprene unit, which consists of two steps: one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to the alkenyl boronates and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols yielding enals. This chem&#8208;stamp could easily be applied repeatedly and separately, empowering the modular concise syntheses of many natural and pharmaceutically active terpenoids including retinal, &#946;&#8208;carotene, vitamin A, tretinoin, fenretinide, acitretin, ALRT1550, nigerapyrone C, peretinoin, and lycopene. Due to the diversified availability of the starting materials, aldehydes and 2,3&#8208;allenols, creation of new non&#8208;natural terpenoids has been realized from four dimensions: the number of isoprene units, side chain, and two terminal groups.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6 minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30 mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11% (residual 250 mM methanol and 20 &#181;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (~98%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Pressure Carbonylation of Benzyl Carbonates and Carbamates for Applications in 13C Isotope Labeling and Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a methodology to access isotopically labeled esters and amides from carbonates and carbamates employing an oxygen deletion strategy. This methodology utilizes a decarboxylative carbonylation approach for isotope labeling with near stoichiometric, ex situ generated 12C, or 13C carbon monoxide. This reaction is characterized by its broad scope, functional group tolerance, and high yields, which is showcased with the synthesis of structurally complex molecules. A complementary method that operates by the catalytic in situ generation of CO via the reduction of CO2 liberated during decarboxylation has also been developed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach that CO2&#8208;derived compounds can be converted to CO&#8208;containing frameworks. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the catalytic steps which highlight the impact of ligand choice to overcome challenges associated with low&#8208;pressure carbonylation methodologies, along with rational for the development of future methodologies.</dc:description>

However, only small&#8208;molecule payloads can be directly transferred to native or engineered antibodies using existing glycoengineering strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment (Fc) glycan could dramatically boost the chemoenzymatic modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) via an engineered fucosyltransferase. In this platform, antibodies with Fc glycans engineered to a simple N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) disaccharide are successfully conjugated to biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in a single step within hours. Accordingly, we synthesized an antibody&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ cluster of differentiation (CD) 3 bispecific antibody and used it to selectively destroy patient&#8208;derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T lymphocyte cells (T cells) inside the organoid. Our results highlight that this platform is a general approach to construct antibody&#8208;biomacromolecule conjugates with translational values.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broad Light&#8208;Harvesting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Enables Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in a Bacterial Biohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rationally designed membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), namely&#160;COE&#8208;IC, which&#160;endows&#160;aerobic N2&#8208;fixing bacteriaAzotobacter vinelandii&#160;with a light&#8208;harvesting ability that enables photosynthetic&#160;ammonia production.&#160;COE&#8208;IC&#160;possesses an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) type conjugated core, which promotes visible light absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore,&#160;COE&#8208;IC&#160;spontaneously associates with&#160;A. vinelandii&#160;to form a biohybrid in which the COE is intercalated within the lipid bilayer membrane. In the presence of L&#8208;ascorbate as a sacrificial electron donor, the resulting&#160;COE&#8208;IC/A. vinelandii&#160;biohybrid showed a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in light&#8208;driven ammonia production, as compared to the control. Photoinduced enhancement of bacterial biomass and production of L&#8208;amino acids is also observed. Introduction&#160;of isotopically enriched&#160;15N2&#160;atmosphere led to the enrichment of&#160;15N&#8208;containing&#160;intracellular metabolites, consistent with the products being generated from&#160;atmospheric N2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane Tension&#8208;Responsive Mechanosensitive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane curvature reflects physical forces operating on the lipid membrane, which plays important roles in cellular processes. Here, we design a mechanosensitive DNA (MSD) nanomachine that mimics natural mechanosensitive PIEZO channels to convert the membrane tension changes of lipid vesicles with different sizes into fluorescence signals in real time. The MSD nanomachine consists of an archetypical six&#8208;helix&#8208;bundle DNA nanopore, cholesterol&#8208;based membrane anchors, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, spiropyran (SP). We find that the DNA nanopore effectively amplifies subtle variations of the membrane tension, which effectively induces the isomerization of weakly emissive SP into highly emissive merocyanine isomers for visualizing membrane tension changes. By measuring the membrane tension via the fluorescence of MSD nanomachine, we establish the correlation between the membrane tension and the curvature that follows the Young&#8208;Laplace equation. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;enabled strategy opens new routes to studying membrane mechanics in physiological and pathological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomerized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted wide research attention in the past decades. Very recently, oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to small&#8208;molecular/polymeric acceptor&#8208;based OSCs due to their unique advantages such as well&#8208;defined structures, batch reproducibility, good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability. So far, rapid advances have been made in the development of OFREAs consisting of directly/rigidly/flexibly linked oligomers and fused ones. In this minireview, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of OFREAs, including structural diversity, synthesis approach,&#160;&#160;molecular conformation and packing, and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this review will encourage the development of novel OFREAs for OSC applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Control of Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light Transparency Based on Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Association of Tetrathiafulvalene Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The light&#8208;transmissive properties of a solid&#8208;state tetrathiafulvalene radical cation&#8211;bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 1&#8208;C5&#8226;+&#8226;NTf2&#8211;, underwent instantaneous changes in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region (1000&#8211;2500 nm) due to upon exposure to solvent vapor or the application of mechanostress at room temperature. The initial solid state of 1&#8208;C5&#8226;+&#8226;NTf2&#8211; exhibited strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR; 700&#8211;1000 nm) and SWIR regions, whereas the absorption in the SWIR region was significantly diminished in the stimulated state induced by dichloromethane vapor. Upon cessation of vapor stimulation, the solid state spontaneously and promptly reverted to its original state, characterized by absorption bands in the NIR/SWIR region. Moreover, the SWIR absorption was absent upon the application of mechanical stress using a steel spatula. The reversal was fast and occurred within 10 s. These changes were visualized using a SWIR imaging camera under 1450&#8208;nm light irradiation. Experimental investigations demonstrated that the transparency to the SWIR light in the solid states was modulated through significant structural transformations of the associated radical cations, with transitions between columnar and isolated &#960;&#8208;dimer structures under ambient and stimulated conditions, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8208;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time, that is, to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8208;guest chemistry inherent in MOC to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytic active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6 &#956;mol g-1 h-1 for H2O2 production under O2-saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time, that is, to build a synergistic metal-nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host-guest chemistry inherent in MOC to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytic active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
