         <title>Fluorescence Visualization of Helix Inversion in Biomimic Polymeric Foldamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, and economical method is provided to directly visualize the solvent&#8208;driven helix inversion in a water&#8208;soluble foldamer using a tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalized hemicyanine dye based on the emission color change from yellow to red. The dyes are first restricted in the low&#8208;polarity groove but then docked on the foldamer surface with the less restricted molecular motions and the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer.








Abstract
Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides possess unique helical structures that are closely related to their biological functions involving recognition, catalysis, replication, and genetic information storage. From a biomimetic perspective, artificial foldamers are the ideal systems to model and study the structure&#8211;property relationship of biomacromolecules. Herein, we report a facile, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective method to directly visualize and monitor the solvent&#8208;driven helix inversion in a water&#8208;soluble poly(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene)&#8208;based foldamer with the aid of a tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalized hemicyanine dye. By adjusting the solvent environment, the foldamer transitions from an M&#8208;helix to a P&#8208;helix, accompanied by a change in the dye's binding mode from groove to surface. This transition alters the degree of restriction and microenvironment polarity, resulting in a visible emission color change from yellow to red, signaling the helix inversion. The present investigation offers a powerful tool for understanding conformational transitions in biomacromolecules and offers insights into the dynamic behavior of helical structures.

         <title>Liquid Metal Dynamic Interface Enabled Reverse Hydrogen Spillover Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic Ga&#8208;Co&#8208;electrolyte interface enables reverse hydrogen spillover, which facilitates hydrogen migration from Ga to Co, balances H* supply and consumption for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia involves intricate and sluggish proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathways, the active hydrogen (H*) flux regulation are crucial for its efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a liquid metal&#8208;based catalyst, Co@Ga, featuring a dynamic liquid Ga core&#8211;solid Co shell interface under operando conditions. This unique architecture enables an unprecedented reverse hydrogen spillover mechanism, where H* generated via facile water dissociation on liquid Ga support spontaneously migrates to adjacent metallic Co for efficient hydrogenation of adsorbed nitrate/intermediates. Moreover, the strong electron donation from Ga to Co also accelerates the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722;&#160;&#8594;&#160;NO2&#8722; step through a three&#8208;step relay mechanism. Consequently, the synergy of these effects endows Co@Ga with exceptional NO3&#8722;RR performance, achieving an ultra&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 51&#160;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gCo&#8722;1, Faraday efficiency of 94.5% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE, and outstanding stability over 400&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a membrane electrode. This work presents the concept of dynamic liquid&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid interfaces for reversing conventional hydrogen spillover, offering a universal strategy to regulate multi&#8208;proton/electron transfers in complex electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Direct Seawater Electrolysis via Redox Mediator for H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis system based on a TQBQ&#8208;COF (Covalent Organic Framework) redox mediator, eliminating the need for desalination and proton exchange membranes (PEMs). The system operates efficiently in real seawater with excellent cycling stability and enables low&#8208;cost hydrogen and chlorine production, meeting the European Commission's green hydrogen target. This scalable approach simplifies system design and supports clean energy transitions, particularly in coastal regions.








Abstract
Acidic seawater electrolysis offers a promising strategy for sustainable hydrogen production. However, its practical application still faces critical challenges including membrane dependency, complex seawater pretreatment, and limited compatibility with intermittent renewable energy. Herein, we construct a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system employing TQBQ&#8208;COF (Covalent Organic Framework) as a solid&#8208;state redox mediator, enabling membrane&#8208; and desalination&#8208;free operation. TQBQ&#8208;COF exhibits excellent electrochemical performances in both acidic deionized water and acidic seawater, demonstrating that common seawater ions do not interfere with its redox activity. When coupled with a Ru&#8208;modified TQBQ&#8208;COF catalyst (COF&#8208;Ru), the DSDE system decouples anode and cathode reactions, allowing flexible integration with intermittent renewable energy for high&#8208;purity H2 and Cl2 production. This system achieves a hydrogen production cost of US$2.5 per kg H2, offering a simplified, robust, and scalable solution for practical seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;Initiated Addition&#8211;Fragmentation Chain Transfer in Allyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of radical&#8208;based vitrimers employing addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer reactions is reported. The vitrimers synthesized from allylic epoxy is undergoing exchange through a degenerative transfer mechanism. Unlike previous systems that required an external initiator, the generation of thiyl radicals necessary for the exchange is triggered thermally by a disulfide hardener, which reversibly generates radicals upon thermal activation.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have emerged as a promising class of materials that incorporate dynamic covalent bonds, enabling reprocessability and recyclability while retaining the advantageous properties of traditional thermosets. Herein, we report a class of radical&#8208;based vitrimers employing addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer reactions. The vitrimer was synthesized via crosslinking of an epoxy monomer containing embedded allylic functionalities capable of undergoing exchange through a degenerative transfer mechanism. The generation of thiyl radicals necessary for the exchange is triggered by a disulfide&#8208;containing hardener which reversibly generates radicals upon thermal activation. Vitrimers were prepared with varying proportions of the disulfide hardener relative to a permanent hardener. All materials exhibited stress relaxation, with relaxation times dependent on the disulfide content. Incorporation of only 10&#160;mol% of disulfide resulted in a relaxation time of 21&#160;min at 200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating dynamic behavior. Full reversibility was confirmed after three reprocessing cycles, with no significant change in glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, and FTIR spectra. Additionally, a model reaction was conducted to prove the exchange mechanism, revealing an activation energy in the range of 48&#160;(&#177;&#160;4)&#160;kJ.mol&#8722;1. This study introduces a novel approach to thermally activated, radical&#8208;based vitrimers, expanding the design for recyclable thermoset materials.

         <title>Zn2+ Storage via Conversion Chemistry of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 in an Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ in organic electrolytes limits Zn2+ storage performance of MnO2 electrodes. Here, adding 2&#160;vol% H2O to an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte significantly accelerates the de&#8208;solvation process and thus enhancing the capacity and cycle life of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 electrodes via initial MnO2 dissolution and ZnO formation during discharge, followed by highly reversible conversion between Mn2++ZnO and layered ZnMn3O7.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese oxide batteries have attracted considerable attention for energy storage applications due to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, unavoidable proton&#8208;involved electrode reactions in mild aqueous electrolytes often lead to significant pH fluctuations and accelerated Zn corrosion, resulting in limited operational lifespans (typically less than 1000&#160;h) for most reported Zn//MnO2 cells. Herein, we investigate the Zn2+ storage behavior of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 in 1&#160;M zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2)/N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte, which delivers negligible capacity due to sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation. Remarkably, introducing a small amount (2&#160;vol%) of water into the DMF&#8208;based electrolyte substantially improves Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics, thereby enhancing the storage performance of the &#945;&#8208;MnO2 electrode without proton participation. We reveal that in this electrolyte, the &#945;&#8208;MnO2 undergoes initial dissolution and ZnO formation during discharge, followed by a highly reversible conversion between Mn2+&#160;+&#160;ZnO and layered ZnMn3O7. Benefiting from the reversible Zn2+ storage mechanism and suppressed Zn corrosion, the Zn//&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell operates stably for 132 days at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and retains 87.1% of its capacity after 1200 cycles. This work offers a new proton&#8208;free conversion reaction pathway for constructing stable Zn&#8211;Mn batteries based on organic electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;The sluggish de-solvation of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in organic electrolytes limits Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage performance of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese oxide batteries have attracted considerable attention for energy storage applications due to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, unavoidable proton-involved electrode reactions in mild aqueous electrolytes often lead to significant pH fluctuations and accelerated Zn corrosion, resulting in limited operational lifespans (typically less than 1000&#160;h) for most reported Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells. Herein, we investigate the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage behavior of &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 1&#160;M zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/&lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte, which delivers negligible capacity due to sluggish Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation. Remarkably, introducing a small amount (2&#160;vol%) of water into the DMF-based electrolyte substantially improves Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation kinetics, thereby enhancing the storage performance of the &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode without proton participation. We reveal that in this electrolyte, the &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes initial dissolution and ZnO formation during discharge, followed by a highly reversible conversion between Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;+&#160;ZnO and layered ZnMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Benefiting from the reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage mechanism and suppressed Zn corrosion, the Zn//&#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell operates stably for 132 days at 0.1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and retains 87.1% of its capacity after 1200 cycles.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Lattice&#8208;Mismatched Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Strain Zn (0002) Anodes for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si substrate beneath Zn plate exhibits ultralow lattice mismatch (0.51%) with highly matched interface (0.2320&#160;versus 0.2308&#160;nm), which enables flat nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane with low nucleation strain, high texture strength (Kearns factor 0.85) and low strain accumulation (7.29&#160;versus 0.22&#160;MPa of ASZ), enabling highly reversible and stable Zn anodes for advanced zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Compared with (101&#175;${\mathrm{\bar 1}}$0) and (101&#175;${\mathrm{\bar 1}}$1) planes, Zn (0002) plane with the lowest nucleation energy is optimal for practical rechargeable zinc metal batteries (ZMBs), but precise crystallographic regulation of Zn (0002) plane orientation to significantly reduce intergranular strain accumulation for lasting ZMBs remain challenges. Herein, we develop an Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si substrate with ultralow lattice mismatch (0.51%) to eliminate hierarchical twins and enable flat Zn nucleation for sustainable epitaxial stacking. Negligible lattice spacing deviation (0.2320&#160;versus 0.2308&#160;nm) between Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si (111) and grown&#8208;Zn (0002) plane achieves near&#8208;zero strain in electrodeposited layer (0.22&#160;versus 7.29&#160;MPa of pure Zn foil). Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si&#8208;Zn (ASZ) anode exhibits a pronounced (0002)&#8208;textured Zn orientation with a high Kearns factor (0.85&#160;versus 0.29 of Zn foil), enabling dendrite&#8208;suppressive planar growth. Consequently, ASZ||Cu cells demonstrate 99.83% Coulombic efficiency, while ASZ||ASZ cells operate stably for 8000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, ASZ||MnO2 coin cells retain 73.97% capacity after 1500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, and pouch cells (2.8 Ah) operate over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work opens a new window for designing lattice&#8208;matched, strain&#8208;free zinc anodes for advanced ZMBs.

         <title>Intact Mass Profiling Reveals Phospho&#8208;Proteoforms of the Catenins (85&#8211;110&#160;kDa) Regulated by Actomyosin Contractility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study advances top&#8208;down individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS) to profile intact phospho&#8208;proteoforms of &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;catenins (85&#8211;110&#160;kDa) within cadherin&#8211;catenin complexes. By modulating actomyosin contractility, we reveal mechano&#8208;sensitive phosphorylation patterns and propose that distinct catenin proteoforms may reflect adhesive states at cell&#8211;cell junctions. 








Abstract
A central challenge in top&#8208;down proteomics (TDP) is the characterization of large proteoforms (&gt;70&#160;kDa) due to their high spectral complexity in mass spectrometers. Here, we advance individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS) for intact mass and fragmentation analysis of &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;catenins (85&#8211;110&#160;kDa), key components of adherens junctions. Using denatured I2MS, we resolved discrete phosphorylation states of catenins isolated from HEK cells subjected to differential actomyosin tension. Up to 10 phosphorylations were detected on &#946;&#8208;catenin (&#946;&#8208;cat) and 7 on &#945;&#8208;catenin (&#945;&#8208;cat), with site&#8208;specific changes corresponding to actomyosin contractility. Notably, phosphorylation at &#945;&#8208;cat S641 was constitutive, while other sites in the P&#8208;linker and actin&#8208;binding domains, as well as &#946;&#8208;cat S675 and S552, were sensitive to actomyosin perturbation. Application of I2MS for fragment ion detection (I2MS2) also enabled 25%&#8211;30% sequence coverage for these exceptionally large proteoforms, compared to &lt;1% using conventional methods for top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS). Our results are consistent with a &#8220;catenin phospho&#8209;code&#8221; model, wherein combinatorial phosphorylation patterns reflect and potentially modulate the mechanotransductive environment at cell&#8211;cell adhesions. This work establishes top&#8208;down I2MS as a viable approach for probing complex post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) landscapes in high&#8208;mass proteins and highlights proteoforms as functional units in cellular regulation.

         <dc:description>
The polar solvent processing steps during p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cell devices fabrication have been shown to induce desorption of weakly adsorbed SAM molecules. To address this, we developed a novel SAM material bearing in situ crosslinking moieties&#8212;4&#8208;(5,9&#8208;diallyl&#8208;7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)butyl phosphonic acid (4PADCB&#8208;V)&#8212;which undergoes polymerization upon UV irradiation. The crosslinked SAM retained structural integrity upon polar solvent exposure, mitigating interfacial defect formation while enhancing charge carrier transport properties and improving perovskite film crystallinity








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in advancing the efficiency and operational stability of p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for scalable manufacturing. However, nonuniform surface coverage and weak interfacial adhesion of SAMs on substrates remain critical bottlenecks for further performance enhancement. The polar solvent processing steps during PSC device fabrication have been shown to induce desorption of weakly adsorbed SAM molecules. To address this, we developed a novel SAM material bearing in situ crosslinking moieties&#8212;4&#8208;(5,9&#8208;diallyl&#8208;7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)butyl phosphonic acid (4PADCB&#8208;V)&#8212;which undergoes rapid polymerization upon UV irradiation. The crosslinked SAM (crs&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;V) retained structural integrity upon polar solvent exposure, mitigating interfacial defect formation while enhancing charge carrier transport properties and improving perovskite film crystallinity. Consequently, crs&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;V&#8208;based devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.46% (certified efficiency of 25.96%) and retained 91% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous illumination.

         <title>Tailoring Spin&#8211;Spin Dipolar Interactions by Conformational Locking Toward Room&#8208;Temperature Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a conformational locking strategy to precisely engineer spin&#8208;spin dipolar interactions (SSDI) in Chichibabin's hydrocarbons (CHs). By controlling the dihedral angle (&#952;), we create stable, high&#8208;spin diradicals, with one candidate, CH(2), exhibiting exceptional spin coherence at room temperature, showcasing its potential as a molecular qubit.








Abstract
Chichibabin's hydrocarbons (CHs) typically exhibit resonance equilibrium between closed&#8208;shell quinoidal and open&#8208;shell diradical configurations due to the flexible rotation of the molecule structure. We herein report a series of conformationally rigidified CHs achieved through lockage of chiral binaphthalene frameworks. Systematic enhancement of open&#8208;shell character was observed with increasing dihedral angles between naphthalene moieties, as evidenced by electronic spectroscopy and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. This conformational locking strategy enables precise engineering of spin&#8211;spin dipolar interactions, unambiguously revealed by zero&#8208;field splitting parameters derived from EPR studies. Specifically, CH(2) exhibits excellent ambient stability and exceptional spin coherence at room temperature, with attractive spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (T1) of 1207&#160;ns and spin dephasing time (Tm) of 205&#160;ns. Our findings establish a molecular design paradigm for controlling electronic coupling in diradical systems, providing critical insights for developing next&#8208;generation quantum materials with tailored spin functionalities.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Induced Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly for Phosphorescence&#8208;to&#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoexcitation&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly strategy enables in situ transformation from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence within a single molecule, achieving dynamically enhanced, oxygen&#8208;resistant time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging.








Abstract
Phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence are currently two important photophysical pathways that have greatly promoted the development of display, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving in situ conversion of these two photophysical pathways within the same molecule is extremely challenging. In this study, we covalently bond chiral donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor' structures into a photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregated molecule, specifically hexathiobenzene, to achieve this goal through light irradiation. Initially, the target molecules predominantly exhibit phosphorescent properties. Upon photoirradiation, chiral self&#8208;assembly occurs within the target molecules, which gives rise to a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;dominant emission behavior. This TADF emission relies on a self&#8208;assembly structure that can effectively prevent oxygen from quenching triplet excitons, resulting in stronger signal intensity and longer photoluminescence lifetime. Consequently, a real time improvement of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging can be achieved with the utilization of our strategy, rendering selectively dynamic control of imaging parameters at the desired time&#8208; and spatial resolution.

         <title>Microenvironmental Regulation of Fe&#9472;N4 Catalytic Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Electrochemical Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino&#8208;fluorinated cyclotriphosphazene is designed and synthesized to regulate the microenvironment around the Fe&#9472;N4 sites in polyphthalocyanines. Due to the large steric hindrance and hierarchical functional groups, the mass&#8208;transfer networks of oxygen and ions are established for accelerating oxygen reduction reaction. This microenvironment effect brings higher device performance in either aqueous Zn&#8208;air batteries or alkaline membrane fuel cells. 








Abstract
The non&#8208;metallic&#8208;Pt materials with high activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have attracted considerable attentions, but still face challenges related to the mismatched performance in device applications, especially for the atomic site catalysts. In this work, we propose a microenvironment&#8208;regulation strategy on introducing amino&#8208;fluorinated cyclotriphosphazene as grafting agents to address the critical issue on the mass&#8208;transfer limitations for the highly active and well&#8208;defined Fe&#9472;N4 sites in phthalocyanine macrocycles. When this functional cyclotriphosphazene was grafted to polyphthalocyanines by the amidate linkage, the large steric hindrance of cyclotriphosphazene and the low surface energy of C&#9472;F bonding in fluorinate groups provide the enriched channels with low hygroscopicity, which guarantees the oxygen supply to Fe&#9472;N4 sites and the hydroxyl leave from catalyst molecules. This microenvironment regulation improves the activities of catalyst molecules in electrochemical testing, and an amplified effect are also shown in the corresponding electrode assemblies. As results, the superior peak power densities of 178&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in aqueous Zn&#8208;air batteries (1.4&#8208;fold enhancements) and 616&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in alkaline membrane fuel cells (2.5&#8208;fold enhancements) are obtained. These findings offer a deeper understanding of non&#8208;Pt catalysts and provide a promising approach to their applications in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Dual Sacrificial Strategy Toward Tough and Recyclable CO2&#8208;Sourced Epoxy Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a CO2&#8208;derived epoxy thermoset designed through a dual sacrificial strategy. The material architecture combines flexible segments for energy dissipation with cleavable linkages for recyclability, while preserving rigidity through cross&#8208;linked networks. The resulting material successfully reconciles traditionally conflicting properties&#8208;toughness, rigidity, and recyclability&#8208;establishing a new paradigm for sustainable high&#8208;performance thermosets.








Abstract
Developing thermosetting epoxy resins that concurrently deliver high performance (integrating superior strength with toughness) and chemical recyclability presents a persistent challenge in sustainable polymer advancement. Herein, we present a dual sacrificial strategy employing CO2&#8208;derived poly(ether&#8208;carbonate) (PPC) polyols as functional epoxy hardeners. Flexible ether segments serve as sacrificial components enhancing toughness, while cleavable carbonate groups function as sacrificial sites facilitating degradation. This dual sacrificial design in PPC polyols demonstrably enhances mechanical properties while enabling degradability. Model reactions and curing kinetics analyses reveal a distinctive dual&#8208;stage crosslinking process governed by hydroxyl transfer mechanisms. The resulting hierarchical cure yields thermosets with unconventional hyperbranched topologies embedded within uniform network structures, conferring: 1) tunable thermomechanical properties (Tg&#160;=&#160;53&#8211;129 &#176;C) through precise polyol content control; 2) substantially elevated toughness (up to 5.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), exceeding conventional epoxy resins by&#160;&gt;300%; and 3) rapid catalytic chemical recyclability (&lt;4&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C), with degradation products functioning as reusable hardeners. Practical validation via glass fiber&#8208;reinforced composites and electronic packaging confirms robust performance with full recyclability. This integrated methodology reconciles the historical trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and chemical recyclability in thermosets, establishing a viable pathway toward sustainable epoxy production.

         <title>Structure Model&#8208;Guided Reprogramming Enables Functional Interconversion of Phomactatriene and Verticillene Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phomactatriene synthase (SiPS) and two verticillene synthases (LxVS and AxVS) from bacteria were identified through genome mining. DFT calculations show that phomactatriene and verticillene compounds share a common rearrangement pathway. Comparative analyses of the synthase structural models, together with molecular modelling and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, enabled their functional interconversion.








Abstract
Terpenoids represent the most structurally diverse class of natural products on Earth. Terpene synthases are key enzymes for constructing the complex and varied terpene skeletons by catalyzing the formation of multiple carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Phomactatriene and verticillene family natural products are both classified as bicyclic diterpenoids, sharing a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane skeleton. In this study, we used genome mining to identify the phomactatriene synthase SiPS from bacteria, together with two verticillene synthases, LxVS and AxVS. Our DFT calculations revealed that the rearrangement pathways for compounds in the phomactatriene and verticillene families follow a shared biosynthetic route. Furthermore, through comparative structural model analyses of the phomactatriene and verticillene synthases, we employed molecular modelling and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to facilitate functional interconversion between these distinct terpene synthases. This work enhances our understanding of terpene biosynthesis and the potential for engineering terpene synthases for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Post&#8208;Polymerization Modifications by Developing gem&#8208;Diboryl Polyolefin as a Platform Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for synthesizing gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a strategically designed gem&#8208;diboryl&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropane monomer is disclosed. Utilizing this gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin as a platform polymer enables diversity&#8208;oriented post&#8208;polymerization modifications (DOPPM). The incorporation of gem&#8208;diboryl moiety effectively stabilizes the ring&#8208;opened propagating radical intermediate during polymerization, thereby promoting linear chain growth while suppressing competing 4&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization that would lead to cyclic polymer formation.








Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) serves as a pivotal synthetic strategy for generating libraries of functional polymers from commodity precursors. The pursuit of practical and efficient PPM methods remains a longstanding objective in polymer chemistry. Herein, we report a novel diversity&#8208;oriented post&#8208;polymerization modification (DOPPM) protocol utilizing gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin as a platform polymer. This polymer is readily synthesized via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a gem&#8208;diboryl&#8208;substituted vinylcyclo&#8208;propane monomer. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the diboryl moiety effectively stabilizes the ring&#8208;opened propagating radical intermediate during polymerization, thereby promoting linear chain growth while suppressing competing 4&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization that would lead to cyclic polymer formation. The gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin exhibits exceptional reactivity and versatility in DOPPM, enabling its conversion into a wide range of functional polyolefins inaccessible via existing methods.

         <title>A Smart Self&#8208;Immobilization Magnetic Resonance Contrast Agent for Delayed Tumor Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ALP&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immobilizing small&#8208;molecule contrast probe was designed, enabling the generation of reactive quinone methide intermediates for efficient proximity labeling of tumor cell membranes with high&#8208;density Gd&#8208;chelates, thereby facilitating delayed magnetic resonance imaging of tumors with enhanced sensitivity and spatial resolution.








Abstract
Achieving tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and high relaxivity remains critical yet challenging for improving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe sensitivity. Here, we present P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd, an enzyme&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;immobilizing small&#8208;molecule MRI probe designed for high&#8208;sensitivity tumor imaging. Upon activation by membrane&#8208;bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP), P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd is enzymatically converted to generate reactive quinone methide intermediates. These intermediates readily undergo nucleophilic addition with proximal protein residues, enabling the covalent conjugation of paramagnetic gadolinium complexes directly onto tumor cell membranes. This enzymatic self&#8208;immobilization markedly increased the longitudinal relaxivity (r1) from 7.35 to 13.15 mM&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (0.5 T, 21.3&#160;MHz, 32&#160;&#176;C) and effectively &#8220;traps&#8221; the probe at the tumor site. P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd showed rapid tumor uptake and efficient covalent labeling, achieving distinct MR contrast enhancement (&gt; 60%). The imaging window was extended for up to 24&#160;h in subcutaneous HeLa and orthotopic K7M2 tumor models. Notably, delayed MRI with P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd enabled precision visualization of &#8764;1.3&#160;mm orthotopic K7M2 tumors in mice. By overcoming the rapid washout and low sensitivity inherent to traditional small&#8208;molecule MRI probes through this enzymatic self&#8208;immobilization strategy, P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd offers a promising approach for high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;spatial resolution delayed tumor MRI, making it particularly effective for early&#8208;stage lesion detection.

         <title>Sparingly Solvating Electrolyte with Hofmeister Selectivity for Practical Long&#8208;Lived Li&#8211;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LiBETI&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte exhibits a Hofmeister&#8208;type anion effect, where bulky chaotropic anions suppress LiPSe solvation, enabling stable cycling of high&#8208;loading Li&#8208;Se batteries.








Abstract
The excessive solvation of lithium polyselenides (LiPSe), which are highly nucleophilic, in organic electrolytes is one of the most critical challenges hindering the practical applications of lithium&#8210;selenium (Li&#8210;Se) batteries. Conventional electrolytes fail to simultaneously ensure the chemical stability with LiPSe, suppress its dissolution, and maintain compatibility with the lithium&#8208;metal anode. To address the above challenges, we report a rationally designed sulfonamide&#8208;based electrolyte with sparingly solvating characteristics, utilizing lithium bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)&#8208; imide (LiBETI) as the lithium salt. An anion&#8208;specific effect analogous to the classical Hofmeister series was identified, in which bulkier and more chaotropic anions suppress the solvation and dissolution of LiPSe. Leveraging this principle, the LiBETI&#8210;sulfonamide electrolyte enables stable cycling of selenium cathodes, delivering a high capacity of &#8204;&#8764;656.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99.5%&#8204; over 200 cycles, along with facilitated kinetics and rate performance. In contrast to conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, the sulfonamide&#8208;based electrolyte not only effectively suppresses LiPSe dissolution but also supports highly reversible Li&#8208;metal anodes. Benefiting both electrodes, our sulfonamide&#8208;based electrolyte enables Li&#8210;Se batteries with high cathode loading (6.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte (&#8764;2.9&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), retaining 89.9% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles. The work highlights the importance of electrolyte design&#8212;particularly anion&#8208;specific effect in achieving long&#8208;lived practical Li&#8211;Se batteries.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Engineered Electrolyte for Highly Stable and Efficient Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis at 2 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and homogeneous electrolyte&#8208;additive strategy enables highly active and durable oxygen evolution at large current densities in alkaline seawater. The highly electronegative F&#8722; ions modulate the electronic structure of Ni/Fe active sites to enhance OH&#8722; adsorption and OER activity, while simultaneously reinforcing the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to prevent Cl&#8722; corrosion.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for hydrogen production while alleviating freshwater scarcity. However, the presence of Cl&#8722; in seawater compromises anode activity and induces severe corrosion, requiring constructing complex electrode architectures that hinder large&#8208;scale application. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating F&#8722; as an electrolyte additive significantly enhances the performance of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) anodes. Upon optimizing the F&#8722; concentration, benchmark NiFe&#8208;LDH showed the lower overpotential than that of the F&#8722;&#8208;free system, and achieved stable operation at 2 A cm&#8722;2 for 1000 h in seawater electrolyte, representing an approximately 500&#8208;fold improvement over the control set of experiment. The consistency between spectroscopic characterization and multi&#8208;scale simulation results revealed that F&#8722;, by virtue of its high electronegativity and charge density, modulates the electronic environment of Ni and Fe sites, enhances the adsorption of OH&#8722;, and thereby improves OER activity. Moreover, the introduction of F&#8722; increases free water content and modulates the hydrogen bond network to promote OH&#8722; transportation while repelling Cl&#8722; at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by polarizing the O&#9472;H bonds of water molecules on NiFe&#8208;LDH surface. This straightforward electrolyte engineering strategy provides a practical and scalable solution for seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Built&#8208;In Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Water Activation for Industrial&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Ethylene from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a BEF@La(OH)3&#8208;Cu electrocatalyst featuring a built&#8208;in electric field, which achieves a record FEC2H4 of 84.2% and high intrinsic activity surpassing 842.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, along with stable operation of 110&#160;h. The built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggered H2O dissociation on La(OH)3&#8208;Cu interface to supply active *H species, facilitating *CO hydrogenation into *COH and enabling efficient asymmetric coupling for C2H4 production.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4), as opposed to traditional industrial methods, stands out as an environmentally friendly benign and promising technical solution for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. Here, we introduce a built&#8208;in electric field in La(OH)3&#8208;Cu (BEF@La(OH)3&#8208;Cu) electrocatalyst that can exclusively convert from CO2 to C2H4 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 84.2% and high intrinsic activity exceeding 842.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, while maintaining robust stability of 110&#160;h. Furthermore, the corresponding C2H4 formation rate and energy efficiency can reach 2618.0&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and 31.2%, respectively. The BEF@La(OH)3&#8208;Cu electrocatalyst was constructed by stacking La(OH)3 and Cu layers, forming a built&#8208;in electric field induced by electron transfer between La&#8594;O&#8592;Cu. The electric field effectively triggered H2O dissociation on La(OH)3&#8208;Cu interface for supplying active hydrogen (*H) species, which promoted multiple protonation steps in the process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion. The *H species then easily migrate to Cu sites, reducing the energy barrier for the conversion from *CO to *COH, thus enhancing the efficient asymmetric *CO&#8722;*COH coupling and ultimately boosting the C2H4 production under ampere&#8208;level operation.

         <title>Resonant Dative Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dative bonds are an integral, albeit underappreciated, part of the theory of chemical bonds. In their resonant form they can bring a surprising stability to a novel family of rings with multiple hyper/hypo&#8208;valent elements.








Abstract
The dative bond is an often underappreciated entity in the theory of chemical interactions, despite its explanatory and predictive potential. In this work, the concept is recovered to computationally design a novel resonant dative bonding pattern in ring molecules, which would be formally considered to be composed of multiple hypervalent and hypovalent atoms. Starting with the (HCPO)3 ring arranged as alternating carbons and phosphorus, we propose that the major Lewis structure is composed of P&#9552;O double bonds and &#8220;semi&#8208;dative&#8208;semi&#8208;covalent&#8221; P&#9472;C bonds. The three carbons technically are a rare case of &#963;0&#960;2 carbenes; however, due to the stability granted by the delocalized, resonant dative bonds, we termed them &#8220;pseudo&#8208;carbenes&#8221;. By experimenting with isoelectronic systems with other elements but with the same bonding pattern, we also observed pseudo&#8208;nitrenes, pseudo&#8208;silylenes, and dicoordinated halogens, among other unusual structures. Surprisingly, the isomeric rings with normal valence and traditional covalent bonds were found to be of much higher energy, suggesting that the resonant dative bonds can potentially be a source of highly stable molecular entities.

         <title>EDA Complex&#8208;Driven Desaturation of Heterocyclic Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by HFIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel light&#8208;mediated desaturation strategy enabled by electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex formation. DFT and mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds via single&#8208;electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and base&#8208;mediated deprotonation sequentially with pyridinium salt serving dually as oxidant and base, and hexafluoroisopropanol functioning as solvent and radical mediator. Notably, this strategy demonstrates broad substrate scope, enabling efficient synthesis of quinolinones, coumarins, and flavones, and also facilitates the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules. 








Abstract
Recently, electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated organic synthetic strategies have emerged as powerful tools for diverse bond&#8208;forming transformations; however, their efficiency often diminishes when ionic reactants are involved. This limitation arises from the requirement of polar solvents such as DMSO or DMF to solubilize ionic species for the formation of effective EDA complex. Consequently, these solvents engage in competing EDA complex formation or disrupt ionization equilibria. In parallel, there is a pressing necessity of modern and efficient strategy to achieve dehydrogenation reactions, which are in general limited by the drawbacks of traditional approaches. To address both, herein, we disclose an innovative desaturation strategy based on the formation of an EDA complex between a dihydrogenated organic substrate and an N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salt. In our study, solubility issues, which are associated with the pyridinium salt, are effectively addressed by using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). Beyond enhancing solubility, HFIP also functions as a transient H&#8208;shuttle, significantly reducing the activation energy for this transformation. This cooperative interplay between HFIP and the pyridinium salt enables the efficient and selective desaturation of a broad range of heterocyclic carbonyl compounds&#8212;including quinolinones, coumarins, and flavones&#8212;which are valuable scaffolds in pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. At the end, detailed mechanistic studies with the aid of experiments as well as DFT studies clearly disclose the mechanism as well as the important role of HFIP in this reaction.

         <title>Decoding Molecular Conformations of Dimeric Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for High&#8208;Sensitivity Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first single&#8208;crystal structures of dimeric NFAs. They feature compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and stronger coupling than monomers. H2&#8208;C8&#8208;based self&#8208;powered near&#8208;infrared photodetectors reach 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;101&#8308; Jones at 880&#160;nm, among the best reported.








Abstract
The molecular conformation and packing behavior of dimeric non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) remain largely unexplored, limiting their rational design for optoelectronic applications. Here, we report the first single&#8208;crystal structures of two imidazole&#8208;based dimeric NFAs, revealing well&#8208;defined intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and compact molecular packing in the monomolecular state. These structural features lead to shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distances and enhanced electronic coupling compared to their monomeric counterpart, resulting in improved charge carrier mobility and photoresponse. By varying the length of the alkyl linker, we tailor the optoelectronic properties and suppress the dark current in organic photodetectors (OPDs), enhancing both external quantum efficiency and specific detectivity. Devices based on the C8&#8208;linked dimer (H2&#8208;C8) achieve a peak detectivity (Dsh*) of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 Jones at 880&#160;nm, and maintain values above 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones across 340&#8211;960&#160;nm with an ultra&#8208;fast photoresponse time of 1.94 (trise) and 2.11 (tfall) &#181;s. These figures of merit place H2&#8208;C8 among the best&#8208;performing self&#8208;powered near&#8208;infrared OPDs, with performance on par with commercial silicon photodiodes. Our findings provide direct structural insights into dimeric NFAs and establish a new design pathway for high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Linker Enantiomericity Engineering in Reticular Frameworks for Architecting Robust Materials with Synergetic Open Metal Sites for Efficient SF6 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsically chiral topology concept and Wallach's rule were leveraged to guide the rational synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework materials with distinct net dimensions and structures. The resulting 3D MOFs obtained exclusively when using enantiopure linkers shows an open structure decorated with exposed open Cu2+ sites that work synergistically to promote the efficient capture of SF6 and SF6/N2 separation.








Abstract
Chiral linkers offer built&#8208;in enantiomericity capable of regulating pore microenvironments or even net dimensions and topologies of the resulting reticular frameworks. Whereas it has been established that enantiopure and racemic linkers can form significantly different structures upon metal directed coordination assembly, such examples are still extremely rare and occur largely through serendipity rather than rational design. In this work, guided by the intrinsically chiral topology concept established in reticular frameworks and the Wallach's rule that racemic crystals are denser than chiral ones in supramolecular systems, we target a unique example where enantiopure linker gives a homochiral 3D porous and robust framework (S&#8208;TAMOF&#8208;3D) with intrinsically chiral (10,3)&#8208;a srs topology while the racemic linker exclusively produces a 2D dense and non&#8208;porous layered structure (race&#8208;TAMOF&#8208;2D), upon crystallization with Cu ions in water at room temperature. This experimental observation points to the fact that linker enantiomericity could lead to structural diversity much greater than has hitherto been suspected. Moreover, the activated S&#8208;TAMOF&#8208;3D shows triangle&#8208;shaped cavities decorated with exposed open Cu2+ sites, which work synergistically to bind SF6 molecules with outstanding SF6/N2 separation performance, as validated by extensive sorption and breakthrough experiments as well as theoretical simulations. Our work suggests that beyond molecular systems, Wallach's rule can also be leveraged to guide the design of extended reticular materials that otherwise are unachievable via traditional linker engineering strategies, thus offering a new methodology for architecting reticular materials with enhanced functions.

&lt;p&gt;The intrinsically chiral topology concept and Wallach's rule were leveraged to guide the rational synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework materials with distinct net dimensions and structures. The resulting 3D MOFs obtained exclusively when using enantiopure linkers shows an open structure decorated with exposed open Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites that work synergistically to promote the efficient capture of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking in Carbon Nanohoops Enables Room&#8208;Temperature Ternary Single&#8208;Molecule Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three pyrene&#8208;embedded nanohoops with distinct molecular symmetries were synthesized. Symmetry engineering discretizes the tunneling pathways, yielding three stable conductance states at room temperature.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule electronics offers chemically encoded routes to ultra&#8208;dense information processing, yet room&#8208;temperature operation is often limited to binary conductance states due to thermal broadening and electronic averaging. Here we demonstrate robust ternary switching at room temperature using symmetry&#8208;engineered carbon nanohoops. Embedding a pyrene unit into the [12]cycloparaphenylene backbone via a symmetry&#8208;breaking 1,6&#8208;linkage disrupts the electronic equivalence of &#960;&#8211;segments and localizes frontier orbitals. Under controlled mechanical elongation in single&#8211;molecule junctions, the molecule exhibits three well&#8208;resolved conductance plateaus, each separated by &#8764;one order of magnitude, affording unambiguous and reproducible readout. First&#8208;principles transport calculations reveal that symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8211;induced orbital localization discretizes coherent tunneling pathways, accounting for the observed plateaus. These findings establish molecular symmetry control as a general design principle for room&#8208;temperature multistate charge transport in conjugated macrocycles, opening a pathway to high&#8208;density single&#8208;molecule logic architectures.

         <title>High&#8208;Loading Gel Cathodes Enabling Energetic Zinc Metal Batteries with Device&#8208;Level Capacities Beyond 100 Ah L&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel cathodes with improved electrolyte wettability and reaction kinetics are developed for high&#8208;energy zinc batteries. Their elastic polymer network supports mass loading over 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and achieves a device&#8208;level volumetric capacity of 120 Ah L&#8722;1, nearly twice that of conventional solid electrodes, demonstrating substantial potential for scalable energy storage.








Abstract
Zinc metal batteries offer high theoretical capacity but are hindered by the absence of cathodes with capable of matching zinc anodes at high loadings. Herein, we present a gel cathode architecture that leverages the compatibility of hydrogels with aqueous batteries to integrate strong interfacial wettability and a porous framework. This design reduces ion transport tortuosity, accelerates interfacial kinetics, and enables an unprecedented active material loading of 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. As a result, full cells paired with zinc anodes achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art volumetric capacity of 120 Ah L&#8722;1. Furthermore, a 1.8 Ah pouch cell validates the scalability and practical feasibility of this approach, establishing a versatile pathway for developing high&#8208;loading cathodes and advancing energetic zinc metal batteries.

         <title>&#8220;Noninnate&#8221; Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective 1,4&#8208;Polymerization of Alkynylcyclopropanes</title>

         <dc:description>
For ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of a given monomer, main&#8208;chain connectivity is typically predetermined regardless of polymerization mechanism. Leveraging &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium intermediates, we override the innate 1,5&#8208;addition pathway in the ROP of strained propargylic electrophiles, producing a conjugated diene&#8208;containing backbones with high stereoselectivity via 1,4&#8208;addition.








Abstract
In ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), main&#8208;chain connectivity is largely dictated by the inherent electronic and steric properties of the monomer. As a result, even when different polymerization mechanisms are employed, the same backbone structure is obtained. Here, we report catalyst&#8208;controlled, noninnate connectivity in the ROP of alkynylcyclopropane dicarboxylates (ACPs). Leveraging &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium intermediates, we redirect the reactivity from the electronically favored 1,5&#8208;addition to a noninnate 1,4&#8208;addition pathway, furnishing a conjugated diene&#8208;based backbone with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The polymerization exhibits controlled characteristics under optimized conditions. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that a strategically positioned quaternary carbon center enforces high configurational rigidity in the organopalladium intermediate, thereby suppressing undesired cyclization and enabling rapid, stereospecific &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. This work demonstrates overriding the innate connectivity in ROP by precisely controlling the fate of organometallic intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Chlorocyclopropene&#8208;Tethered Diazocarbonyl Compounds and Their Cyclization to Form Poly&#8208;Substituted Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiCl4&#8208;mediated dual C&#9472;F bond functionalization of&#160;gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes has been developed, which enables regioselective synthesis of diverse chlorocyclopropene&#8208;tethered diazocarbonyl compounds. The resultant products were converted to poly&#8208;substituted phenols through a novel Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization.








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a dual C&#9472;F bond functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes using a catalytic amount of TiCl4. The reaction proceeds through a sequential nucleophilic addition of chloride and silyl diazoenolates to the nonsymmetric cyclopropenium cations generated by the fluoride abstraction. The preferential monofluorocyclopropenium&#8208;titanate(IV) salts enable an efficient halogen transfer within the ion pairs, thus providing the opportunity to accept the addition of another type of nucleophiles. A stable [(PhC3HCl)+]2[Ti4Cl12F6]2&#8722; salt was isolated, and its structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. The chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of two different nucleophiles gives vicinal substitution products regardless of the electronic properties of substituents on the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes and the sizes of nucleophiles. Various 2&#8208;chlorocyclopropene&#8208;tethered diazocarbonyl compounds were prepared with the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups. The synthetic utility of the resultant products was demonstrated by the discovery of a new poly&#8208;substituted phenol synthesis via a Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction.

         <title>Solvent's Covert Role: Concerted Anion&#8208;Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation Rewrites Voltage Rules for Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Operando Raman reveals concerted solvent&#8208;anion co&#8208;intercalation in graphite cathodes, redefining dual&#8208;ion battery thermodynamics via a donor number&#8208;dielectric constant (DN&#8208;&#949;) descriptor. This enables predictive voltage control and electrolyte design for energy&#8208;dense dual&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Anion intercalation into graphite cathodes governs dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) performance but suffers from unexplained solvent&#8208;driven voltage shifts (&gt;500&#160;mV) and capacity variations (12&#8208;fold) across electrolyte solvents. Prevailing thermodynamic models overlook solvent involvement due to unresolved anion&#8208;solvent coupling dynamics. Using a spatially resolved operando Raman platform, we detect solvent&#8208;specific vibrational fingerprints and graphite G&#8208;band splitting at identical intercalation thresholds, confirming simultaneous anion&#8208;solvent insertion. This redefines solvents as active thermodynamic directors, revealing two hidden energetic contributions: 1) cation desolvation penalties governed by solvent donor number (DN) and 2) dielectric constant (&#949;)&#8208;modulated screening between anions and graphene layers. Integrating these into a revised Nernst model yields a DN&#8208;&#949; descriptor that quantitatively predicts intercalation voltages across solvents. We further demonstrate that salt&#8208;concentrated electrolytes disrupt this mechanism by depleting solvent activity, shifting pathways from co&#8208;intercalation to anion&#8208;dominant insertion. This work resolves long&#8208;standing DIB anomalies in anion&#8208;inserted graphite cathode reactions and establishes solvent properties as central levers for energy&#8208;dense DIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Water Bonding on Clusters Enables Ultrafast Humidity Response and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ultrafast cluster&#8208;based humidity sensor is demonstrated with PhQPCu3I3 featuring a semi&#8208;exposed Cu3I3 crown, which can simultaneously establish rapid water adsorption and desorption through dynamic synergistic bonding of H&#9472;I and HO&#9472;I, leading to ultrashort response and recovery time of 0.54 and 0.45 s comparable to human reaction time (0.5 s) and competent for real&#8208;time human&#8208;body related (HBR) humidity monitoring. 








Abstract
Fast response and recovery are crucial for real&#8208;time human&#8208;body related (HBR) humidity monitoring, which faces a formidable challenge, due to the opposite requirements on interaction intensities of sensing materials with water. Herein, we demonstrate the first cluster&#8208;based humidity sensor with PhQPCu3I3 featuring a semi&#8208;exposed Cu3I3 crown. Compared to ligand encapsulated Cu4I4 clusters, low coordination, short distance and same orientation of iodine atoms in PhQPCu3I3 lead to a rapid and reversible &#8220;H2O&#160;+&#160;I&#8230;I&#8221; reaction. Consequently, besides more than doubled sensitivity of 106 and halved hysteresis error of 3.2% in related humidity range of 11%&#8211;97%, PhQPCu3I3 endows its devices with ultrashort response and recovery time of 0.54 and 0.45 s comparable to human reaction time (0.5 s). Owing to its record&#8208;low comprehensive reaction time within 1.0 s, PhQPCu3I3 based sensors were used for real&#8208;time respiratory rate monitoring and non&#8208;contact information input. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of &#8220;dynamic synergistic bonding&#8221; in combining rapid water adsorption and desorption and superiority of cluster sensors in real&#8208;time HBR applications.

         <title>Asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation of Carbazoles by Cooperative Potassium&#8208;Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Aryloxide Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation of carbazoles to construct fully substituted stereocenters was achieved using indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones as alkylating agents via a cooperative catalytic system. An in situ generated polyfunctional potassium catalyst, featuring Lewis acidic, Br&#248;nsted basic, and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating sites, enables efficient amination with broad scope and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation of carbazoles to construct fully substituted stereocenters remains a significant challenge due to issues of regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, and steric hindrance. In this work, we address these obstacles by employing indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones as suitable electrophilic partners in a cooperative catalytic system. An in situ generated polyfunctional potassium catalyst, integrating Lewis acidic, Br&#248;nsted basic, and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating sites, effectively promotes the nucleophilic amination process, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and excellent selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that coordination of the carbonyl group in indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones to the potassium center is critical for lowering the activation barrier, while both the naphthalenolate and the naphthol moiety in the catalyst facilitate proton transfer. The resulting enantioenriched carbazole&#8211;oxindole hybrids, featuring two privileged scaffolds, may hold promising potential for medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Copolymer Sequence Regulation Enabled by Reactivity Ratio Fingerprints via Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;based approach has been established with &#8220;reactivity ratio fingerprints&#8221; design, enabling instant determination of reactivity ratios from arbitrary reaction design. This approach presents exceptional versatility to analyze the condition influence (e.g., temperature, solvent) on reactivity ratios, promoting on&#8208;demand sequence regulation and azeotropic copolymerizations for a broad scope of binary and ternary copolymers.








Abstract
Sequence control is critical for tuning polymer properties in high&#8208;end applications, where reactivity ratios serve as key parameters for analyzing and regulating sequences. Nevertheless, traditional determination methods exhibit low experimental efficiency and are typically confined to two&#8208;component copolymerization. Here, we develop a machine learning platform, which leverages a novel design of &#8220;reactivity ratio fingerprints&#8221; (rFPs) to determine reactivity ratios in binary and ternary copolymerizations. Deep learning models trained on millions of rFPs enable highly efficient (millisecond&#8208;level) determination from sparse experimental data (random monomer structures, arbitrary reaction design). This approach demonstrates outstanding versatility to analyze reactivity ratios under diverse conditions (e.g., temperature, solvent). Notably, rFP&#8208;guided reaction design promotes on&#8208;demand sequence tailoring, compatible with a wide range of binary and ternary monomer combinations. Kinetic investigations and glass transition characterizations support the formation of varied sequence structures, facilitating the identification of binary and ternary azeotropic copolymerizations. This work not only unveils an attractive strategy for determining reactivity ratios but also offers a generalizable framework for sequencing complicated chain structures toward property engineering.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Polymerization: Synthesis of Chiral Polythioesters from Racemic Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Lewis acid/base&#8208;SalBinamAl&#8221; catalytic system was employed to achieve efficient DKRP of thiolactones with full monomer conversion and allowed access to chiral polythioesters with perfectly isotacticities (Pm up to 0.99). This dynamic kinetic resolution polymerization provides a new conceptual strategy to guide and inspire the synthesis of chiral polymers from racemic monomers.








Abstract
Chiral polymers are fundamentally important and interesting in nature and scientific research. For the preparation of chiral polymers, the standard kinetic resolution polymerization (KRP) of racemic monomers could only afford a 50% yield of chiral polymers with 50% unreacted monomer leftover. In this contribution, we have developed a dynamic kinetic resolution polymerization (DKRP) strategy to synthesize chiral polymers with complete conversion and improved isoselectivity from racemic monomers. A &#8220;Lewis acid/base&#8208;SalBinamAl&#8221; catalytic system was employed to achieve efficient DKRP of thiolactones with full monomer conversion and allowed access to chiral polythioesters with perfectly isotacticities (Pm up to 0.99). The formation of chiral polythioesters was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and optical rotation testing. Detailed kinetic investigation supported a DKRP mechanism. This work represented the very first example of dynamic kinetic resolution ring&#8208;opening polymerization and could provide a new conceptual strategy to guide and inspire the synthesis of chiral polymers from racemic monomers.

         <title>Knoevenagel Condensation Enables a High&#8208;Dipole Interfacial Molecule for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecule was synthesized to optimize substrates of invert wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. Ideal substrates with enhanced wettability and promoted conductivity were obtained, meanwhile, modulated crystallization dynamics toward diminished buried defects and released residual stress were simultaneously achieved. The inverted devices and perovskite&#8208;organic tandem device yielded champion PCE of 19.08% and 26.10%, respectively.








Abstract
The rational molecular design of interfacial modifiers is critical for optimizing charge transport and defect passivation in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we introduce a novel multifunctional molecule, (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanovinyl) phenylamine (BCPA), synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation reaction, featuring a highly polar architecture with a ground&#8208;state dipole moment of 18.16 Debye, significantly exceeding that of the benchmark Me&#8208;4PACz (1.60 Debye). This pronounced polarity stems from a synergistic combination of an electropositive ammonium group (&#9472;NH3&#8314;) and electronegative cyano (&#9472;CN) and bromine (&#9472;Br) substituents, which collectively foster strong interfacial dipole&#8211;substrate interactions. The &#9472;CN moiety coordinates with Ni&#739;&#8314; in NiOX and Pb2&#8314; in perovskites, effectively passivating electronic defects and modulating self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM) anchoring. Meanwhile, the &#9472;NH3&#8314; group forms stable bonds with perovskite lattice, modulating crystal growth kinetics, and improving interfacial contact. The Br atom ensures intrinsic compatibility with bromine&#8208;rich wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Notably, the rigid, planar structure of BCPA facilitates ordered SAM packing via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, enhancing interfacial charge extraction. BCPA&#8208;modified hole transport layers significantly improve the buried perovskite/substrate interface by reducing trap densities, enhancing crystallinity, and aligning energy levels. As a result, modified WBG PSCs realized a champion efficiency of 19.08% with reinforced durability. Furthermore, when applied in perovskite&#8208;organic tandem configurations, the devices reach a remarkable PCE of 26.10%, highlighting the importance of interfacial modifier for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics.

         <title>Cu&#8211;Mg Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with CO Spillover for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8211;Mg dual single&#8208;atom catalyst with Mg&#8211;N2 and Cu&#8211;N2 coordination was structured, in which Mg&#8211;N2 sites activate CO2 to *CO that migrates to adjacent Cu&#8211;N2 centers for hydrogenation to CH4. Benefited from the site&#8208;specific *CO spillover pathway, the optimized CuN2&#8211;MgN2 electrocatalyst achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 78.3% and a partial current density of 228.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE under ambient CO2 conditions.








Abstract
Selective electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to CH4 remains a significant challenge due to the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process and competing C&#9472;C coupling pathways. Here, a Cu&#8211;Mg dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (CuN2&#8211;MgN2), which enables a spatially confined CO spillover mechanism was constructed. Spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the atomically dispersed Mg sites not only modulate the electronic structure of Cu sites to lower the overall energy barrier of the CO2RR to CH4, but also efficiently activate CO2 to form *CO intermediates, which subsequently migrate to adjacent Cu sites to further hydrogenate into CH4. Leveraging these dual advantages, the optimized CuN2&#8211;MgN2 electrocatalyst achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 78.3% and a partial current density of 228.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at&#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE under ambient CO2 conditions, with the Turnover frequency of CH4 on Cu single sites reaching up to 1.72 s&#8722;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. This work not only reveals the dynamic regulation mechanism of intermediates during CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at the atomic scale but also establishes a universal theoretical model for designing industrial&#8208;grade electrocatalysts with well&#8208;defined active site configurations.

         <title>C&#9472;H Silylation of Unactivated Arenes Catalyzed by a Borenium/Pyridine Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis pair, composed of a highly Lewis acidic borenium ion and a weak pyridine base, can catalyze C&#9472;H silylation of benzene and other unactivated arenes with H2SiArF2 (ArF&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl) as the silylation reagent. This system can also be applied for direct C&#9472;H silylation of polystyrene. A key pyridine&#8208;coordinated silylium intermediate was isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H silylation of arenes provides a straightforward and sustainable method for the functionalization of arenes. However, to date, it has been limited to electron&#8208;rich arenes. Here we report a Lewis pair, composed of a highly Lewis acidic borenium ion and a weak pyridine base, can catalyze C&#9472;H silylation of benzene and other unactivated arenes with H2SiArF2 (ArF&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl) as silylation reagent under neat conditions. Unlike most of its noble metal counterparts, this metal&#8208;free system does not require stoichiometric sacrificial hydrogen acceptors. Additionally, this system can be applied for direct C&#9472;H silylation of polystyrene, opening a new avenue for the functionalization of polystyrene. Our mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of H2SiArF2 by the Lewis pair leads to the formation of a pyridine&#8208;coordinated silylium intermediate, which was isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the C&#9472;H activation mediated by this silylium intermediate is likely the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Perspective on Interdisciplinary Approaches on Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemotaxis is the movement of individual organisms towards or away from a chemical stimulus. This phenomenon is investigated in various disciplines, ranging from biology to physics and even engineering. This perspective aims to summarise recent developments in the field and encourage the unification of terminology to promote interdisciplinary knowledge transfer and collaboration.








Abstract
Most living things on Earth &#8211; from bacteria to humans &#8211; must migrate in some way to find favourable conditions. Therefore, they nearly all use chemotaxis, in which their movement is steered by a gradient of chemicals. Chemotaxis is fundamental to many processes that control our well&#8208;being, including inflammation, neuronal patterning, wound healing, tumour spread in cancer, even embryogenesis. Understanding it is a key goal for biologists. Despite the fact that many basic principles appear to have been conserved throughout evolution, most research has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that control signal processing and locomotion. Cell signaling &#8211; cells responding to time&#8208;varying external signals &#8211; underlies almost all biological processes at the cellular scale. Chemotaxis of single cells provides particularly amenable model systems for quantitative cell signaling studies, even in the presence of noise and fluctuations, because the output, the cell's motility response, is directly observable. However, the different scientific disciplines involved in chemotaxis research rarely overlap, so biologists, physicists and mathematicians interact far too infrequently, methodologies and models differ and commonalities are often overlooked, such as the possible influence of physical or environmental conditions, which has been largely neglected.

         <title>Simultaneous Induction and Self&#8208;Reporting of Nucleolar Stress by a Nucleolus&#8208;Targeted Platinum(II) Complex via Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first example of a metal complex that can achieve simultaneous induction and self&#8208;reporting of nucleolar stress via PLIM of nucleolar viscosity. The phosphorescence response of this platinum(II) complex to viscosity is achieved by suppressing the structural distortion to the non&#8208;emissive d&#8211;d excited state and restricting the rotation of Pt&#9472;N coordination bonds.








Abstract
The nucleolus exhibits characteristic viscous fluid dynamics, whereas nucleolar stress plays a key role in carcinogenesis. However, monitoring nucleolar viscosity in living cells remains a great challenge, which also leads to the lack of a clear report on the relationship between nucleolar viscosity and nucleolar stress. Herein, a nucleolus&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex with monodentate ligands (Pt2) has been developed, which can rapidly accumulate in the nucleolus and inhibit ribosome biogenesis through energy&#8208;dependent signaling pathways, eventually inducing nucleolar stress and simultaneously monitoring nucleolar viscosity via phosphorescence lifetime imaging (PLIM). The phosphorescence response of Pt2 to viscosity is achieved by suppressing the structural distortion to the non&#8208;emissive d&#8211;d excited state and restricting the rotation of Pt&#9472;N coordination bonds, which is different from other commonly reported viscosity probes in the literature. After exposure to Pt2 or other antineoplastic agents, which can induce nucleolar stress, the gradual decrease of nucleolar viscosity is observed in living cells in a quantitative and real&#8208;time manner, indicating that nucleolar viscosity can be used as a real&#8208;time monitor of the extent of nucleolar stress. This work reports the first example of a metal complex that can achieve simultaneous induction and self&#8208;reporting of nucleolar stress via PLIM of nucleolar viscosity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;site Relay Catalysts with Regulating Intrinsic Activity of each Functional Site for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi &#8208;site relay catalysts of Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF are rationally designed and constructed, where the electron&#8208;deficient Fe7C3 can accelerate water dissociation, and the resulting protons can rapidly migrate from Fe7C3 to Ru. The Ru sites with moderate H* adsorption energy facilitate hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Ruthenium is emerging as a promising catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis. However, the high energy barrier for water dissociation and inappropriate hydrogen adsorption energy often hinders their catalytic efficiency. To address these challenges, Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF with abundant twin boundaries has been rationally designed based on synergistic relay catalysis principles. Experimental results combined with mechanistic analysis demonstrate that the electron&#8208;deficient Fe7C3 can accelerate water dissociation, and the resulting protons can rapidly spill over to Ru due to a smaller work function difference, subsequently, the Ru with moderate &#916;GH* facilitates hydrogen evolution. Notably, Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF with twin&#8208;boundary defects and charge redistribution induced by the heterointerface optimizes the adsorption energy and enhances the intrinsic activity of each functional site. As expected, this catalyst exhibits enhanced HER performance that is superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the assembled anion exchange membrane water electrolysis utilizing Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF//NiFe LDH operates at a voltage of 1.67&#160;V at a current density of 0.5 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains remarkable stability over 300&#160;h. This work offers a valuable strategy for the rational design of multisite electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloys Embedded in CeO2 for Polysulfide/Sulfide Bidirectional Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCoMoIr entropy alloy embedded in CeO2 was modified on carbon nanotubes as a functional intercalation of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery to promote the bidirectional catalytic conversion of Li2S6 and Li2S. The results show that the pouch cell at the 2 Ah&#8208;level has an energy density of 436.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, with a capacity decay rate of 0.039% after 800 cycles.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li2S oxidation reaction (SOR) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) seriously affect their practical applications. Herein, we prepared a functional interlayer for LSBs consisting of hydroxylated carbon nanotubes dispersed with NiCoMoIr medium&#8208;entropy alloys embedded in CeO2 surface materials. Experimental results revealed a bidirectional catalytic mechanism involving different elements, verifying that Ir and Ni promote the SRR of Li2S6 to Li2S. Meanwhile, Co and Mo were found to primarily promote the conversion process of Li2S to Li2S6. CeO2 exhibits a bidirectional synergistic effect on enhancing the kinetics of the SRR and SOR. The battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1535.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, and the decay rate is only 0.051% for per&#8208;cycle of 1000 cycles at 1 C. More importantly, a 2 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with an energy density of 436.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and the capacity decay rate was 0.039% per&#8208;cycle after 800 cycles.

         <title>Hydroxylamine Cation as B&#8208;Site with Radius and Dipole Moment Modulation for Metal&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite to Enhance X&#8208;ray Detection Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functional mechanism of B&#8208;site radius and dipole moment modulation in metal&#8208;free halide perovskites was innovatively explored. The NH3OH+ cation with larger radius and dipole moment can strengthen the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, stabilize the lattice structure, and suppress ion migration. Using this modulation strategy, the X&#8208;ray detector achieved ultralow dark current drift (1.86&#215;10&#8722;7 nA cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1).








Abstract
Nowadays, metal&#8208;free halide perovskites (MFHPs) with good structural tunability, biocompatibility, and light weight have been studied in the X&#8208;ray field. Unlike the strong ionic bonds in metal halide perovskites, weak hydrogen bonds play a significant role in the stability and performance of MFHPs. However, as a critical component in the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, the B&#8208;site cation (NH4+) exhibits spatial, geometric, and symmetry conflicts with the octahedral framework, constraining the viable material and structure compositions in MFHPs. In this study, the NH3OH+ cation with larger radius and dipole moment is successfully incorporated into MFHPs to explore the functional mechanisms of B&#8208;site design. Theoretical simulations and experiments reveal that the NH3OH+ cation can regulate octahedral composition and structural dimensionality of MFHPs, thereby optimizing bandgap and carrier transport capacity. Importantly, hydroxyl groups in NH3OH+ can increase hydrogen&#8208;bond sites and strength, reinforcing the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks to stabilize the lattice structure and inhibit ion migration, thereby optimizing the device stability. Finally, the designed DABCO&#8208;NH3OHCl3 detector exhibited exceptional stability and sensitivity (1460 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 200&#160;V bias) under prolonged X&#8208;ray irradiation, achieving ultralow dark current drift (1.86&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7 nA cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Hence, the reported NH3OH+ cation will offer design guidelines for future MFHPs optimization.

         <title>Conformational Quenching in an Engineered Lipocalin Protein Achieves High Affinity Binding to the Toxin Colchicine</title>

Specific high affinity recognition of colchicine by an engineered anticalin involves loop dynamics and conformational selection








Abstract
The engineered lipocalin Colchicalin binds the clinically relevant plant toxin colchicine with picomolar affinity. X&#8208;ray structures revealed major loop rearrangements at the open end of the &#946;&#8208;barrel upon ligand binding, suggesting a critical role for protein dynamics. Here, we integrated solution NMR relaxation experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov modelling to examine conformational dynamics in the free and ligand&#8208;bound Colchicalin on the picosecond&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale. Fast backbone dynamics were comparable in the presence and absence of colchicine, indicating preserved secondary structure. However, large&#8208;scale fluctuations in the structurally variable loops on the microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale were observed in the apo form. We identified conformational exchange between three states, binding competent, partially closed and fully closed, characterised by loop L3 rearrangements. Colchicine binding quenches these motions, indicating a strong interplay between protein dynamics and ligand recognition. Our results support conformational selection over induced fit as the binding mechanism, highlighting the critical role of slow&#8208;timescale dynamics to enable specific, high&#8208;affinity ligand recognition and providing an important example for rational drug design.

         <title>In Situ NMR and Kinetics Reveal Origins of Regioselectivity Differences for Epichlorohydrin Ring&#8208;Opening in Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselectivities for epichlorohydrin ring&#8208;opening over Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid zeolites change by an order of magnitude upon replacing fractions of methanol with acetonitrile co&#8208;solvent. Combining transient operando 13C&#8208;NMR with traditional kinetic measurements reveals that these differences originate from competition between an SN1 pathway through ring&#8208;opened carbocation intermediates formed from epichlorohydrin and an SN2 pathway through a methanol&#8208;derived intermediate. This work provides spectroscopic evidence for epoxide ring&#8208;opening intermediates and mechanisms not previously established over solid catalysts.








Abstract
Altering the quantities and organization of reactive species at active sites enables control of turnover rates and regioselectivities (rate ratios) for ring&#8208;opening of epichlorohydrin (C3H5ClO) across two orders of magnitude. Kinetic analysis suggests that parallel monomolecular (SN1) and bimolecular (SN2) substitution mechanisms contribute to observed rates of C3H5ClO reactions with methanol (CH3OH) over both Lewis (Sn&#8208;BEA) and Br&#248;nsted acid (Al&#8208;BEA) zeolites in liquid solvents. In situ solid&#8208;state 13C&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SS&#8208;NMR) measurements give direct evidence for the proposed ring&#8208;opened carbocations and activated CH3OH intermediates over these catalysts. Interpretation of time&#8208;resolved operando 13C&#8208;SS&#8208;NMR spectra shows that C3H5ClO&#8208;derived carbocations and CH3OH&#8208;derived surface species convert to ring&#8208;opening products through SN1 and SN2 reaction mechanisms and subsequently form distinct product regioisomers. These NMR spectra also reveal a concomitant shift from SN1 to SN2 reactions with increases in the coverage of CH3OH&#8208;derived reactive intermediates achieved by control of the local concentrations of CH3OH, C3H5ClO, and diluting CH3CN. This knowledge provides new insight into the role of coverage on regioselectivity and rates of catalytic reactions of organic species at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Induced Bridged Electrolyte Design Strategy Mitigates Capacity Decay in Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of anions on solvation structure and interphase composition/structure are demonstrated using an anion&#8208;induced bridged electrolyte design strategy. The multidentate coordination propensity of nitrate promotes the formation of densely packed ion pairs in the electrolyte, which could achieve anion&#8208;derived interphase, fast Li+ transfer kinetics, and anode/cathode compatibility, enabling record&#8208;long life in Li||SPAN batteries.








Abstract
Previous strategies have improved the compatibility of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) in ether&#8208;based electrolytes by constructing a relatively stable interphase, but the electrode degradation caused by sluggish kinetics has limited the practical implementation of SPAN cathodes. Here, we propose an anion&#8208;induced bridged electrolyte (AIBE) design strategy to simultaneously achieve anode/cathode compatibility, anion&#8208;derived interphase formation, and fast Li+ transfer kinetics in Li||SPAN batteries through utilizing small&#8208;sized nitrate (NO3&#8722;) anions with multidentate coordination propensity. One NO3&#8722; could coordinate with multiple Li+ ions to promote the formation of bridged complexes ([Li+&#8211;NO3&#8722;&#8211;Li+]) with reduced Li+&#8211;Li+ distances. These densely packed ion pairs create an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and fast Li+ interfacial reaction kinetics. Simultaneously, the optimized AIBE facilitates the formation of a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interphase to suppress electrode degradation. This electrolyte mitigates SPAN cathode decay, enabling a Li||SPAN full cell to retain 80.5% capacity after 500 cycles. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (50&#160;&#181;m Li, 4.0&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 SPAN, lean 1.52&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte) achieves 99.7% capacity retention after 95 cycles. This work elucidates the fundamental role of NO3&#8722; anions in modifying the solvation structure and interphase composition/structure, offering novel perspectives for advanced electrolytes for Li||SPAN batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic combination of dynamic covalent bonding, coordination&#8208;driven assembly, and electrostatic interactions in an in situ tandem process enables the controlled organization of disordered ionic and molecular species into highly ordered architectures, allowing systematic modulation of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. This work establishes a robust synthetic approach for the rational design of boron&#8208;oxo clusters and their assembly into well&#8208;defined architectures. Details are described in the Research Article (e202519221) by Jian Zhang et&#160;al.

In their Research Article (e202514746), Kaixing Fu et&#160;al. present a surface&#8208;functionalized UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 sorbent, enabling synergistic interactions with long&#8208;chain PFAS through the surface&#8208;modified proximal oligoalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium motifs. Consequently, the sorbent exhibits rapid kinetics and high sorption capacities for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives, highlighting the critical role of surface chemistry modulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs, and advancing structure&#8208;oriented design of high&#8208;performance sorbents for the remediation of water environments.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Low&#8208;Spin WIII&#8208;Triggered Triplet Spin&#8208;Polarized Electron Delocalization of Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Reduction of Uranium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;light driven photocatalysis is a green and efficient technology to immobilize high&#8208;toxic and radioactive uranium (U). In their Research Article (e202519402), Wen Liu and co&#8208;workers designed a facet engineered WO3 nanowires with OVs confined to (110) surfaces ((110)&#8208;WO2.35) with low&#8208;spin WIII configuration. As a result, enhanced &#960;* occupancy driven by electronic redistribution in dxz/dyz&#8211;py/pz hybrid orbitals of W elevated the conduction band, markedly boosting electron donation capability for U(VI) reduction.

         <title>Spatial Assembly of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes on Rationally Designed Cavitands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial molecular assembly strategy enables the synthesis of enantioenriched mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Inherently chiral cavitands are rationally designed to encode and transmit the stereochemical information. Predictable stereochemical induction is achieved by controlling the spatial arrangement of molecular components through engineering combinations of covalent bonding, noncovalent interactions, and reaction activation.








Abstract
Chirality plays a central role in chemistry, biology, and pharmaceutical sciences. Although covalent chirality is widely studied, stereoselective assembly of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) remains challenging. Herein, we report a spatial assembly strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes. Rationally designed inherently chiral cavitands orchestrate the spatial arrangement of macrocycle and axle components during mechanical interlocking. This approach enables high levels of stereocontrol in both active&#8208;template and passive&#8208;template synthesis of MPC rotaxanes (up to 93:7 e.r.). Our study demonstrates that stereoinduction of MIMs can be made predictable through rational design of chiral auxiliaries, paving the way for applications of the spatial assembly strategy in asymmetric supramolecular synthesis.

         <dc:description>
In the Research Article by Anjana Devi and co&#8208;workers (e202513066) a new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex is introduced as a thermally stable atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. It features a rare mononuclear structure, suitable volatility, and a low melting point of 55 &#176;C. ALD trials yielded lithium silicate films. This study opens new directions for NHC&#8208;ligand chemistry in thin&#8208;film deposition applications.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Confinement of Polyiodides by Dual&#8208;Functional Tetrazine Cathodes in Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Chi, Huang, Qu et&#160;al. reported a new cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries based on the 2I3&#8722;@BMT anion complex. In this correspondence, we highlight the lack of proper authorship attribution for the BMT ligand and its complexes with the triiodide anion (I3&#8722;). We also highlight major issues in the material's characterization and theoretical calculations, as well as inconsistencies in the equilibrium data for I3&#8722; binding by BMT in solution.








Abstract
In a recent research article (doi.org/10.1002/anie.202507497), Chi, Huang, Qu et&#160;al. described a multifunctional cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries based on a s&#8208;tetrazine ligand bearing two morpholine pendants, forming the active 2I3&#8722;@BMT complex. In addition to the lack of proper attribution for prior reports by other authors (doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01138; doi.org/10.1039/c7dt00134g) regarding the design of this ligand as an anion receptor, its synthesis and its ability to form triiodide complexes, the article is affected by serious scientific/technical flaws. The actual composition of the 2I3&#8722;@BMT complex was not established, and protonation of morpholine groups in aqueous media, essential to the formation of the triiodide complex, was overlooked, despite prior studies and crystallographic evidence. The 2:1 I3&#8722;:BMT ratio was investigated in chloroform using a Job plot, while a 1:1 stability constant was determined via UV&#8211;vis titration in the same solvent. Both methods raise concerns, their results lack consistency and the extrapolation of data from chloroform to aqueous systems is not justified. Additionally, theoretical calculations yielded a highly positive binding energy, erroneously interpreted as indicative of complex stability, and a questionable complex structure featuring unconvincingly short anion&#8211;tetrazine contacts. Nevertheless, functioning of reported cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is a notable outcome of the study.

Additionally, theoretical calculations yielded a highly positive binding energy, erroneously interpreted as indicative of complex stability, and a questionable complex structure featuring unconvincingly short anion&#8211;tetrazine contacts. Nevertheless, functioning of reported cathode for Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is a notable outcome of the study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Generally Grafting Hydrophobic Polymer Brushes in Pure Water Through SIP of Phase Transfer Delivered Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;grafted hydrophobic polymer brushes play a critical role in surface modification. Hydrophobic polymer brushes are facilely but efficiently fabricated in pure aqueous phase with phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;delivered water&#8208;immiscible monomers using methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the transport carrier. The method enables easy alternating or simultaneous grafting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers in an environment and user&#8208; and user&#8208;friendly manner. The resulting polymer brushes show great potential in information encoding and low&#8208;friction lubrication, as reported by Wei Li in their Research Article (e202516468).

         <title>Redox Reactions with Calcium&#8208;Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium metal nanoparticles (5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm) are realized by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with [LiNaph] in toluene. Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold.








Abstract
Calcium is generally a highly reactive alkaline&#8208;earth metal, but as bulk metal, it exhibits only low reactivity at ambient conditions due to small surface area, low solubility, and/or passivation. The reactivity can be significantly enhanced when using small&#8208;sized calcium nanoparticles. In this regard, we describe the first synthesis of Ca(0) nanoparticles, 5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm in size, by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with lithium naphthalenide in toluene (TMEDA: N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine). We also show Ca(0) nanoparticles to be substantially different from so&#8208;called &#8220;Rieke calcium&#8221;. The high reactivity can be used for redox reactions, for instance, with [Cp2MoCl2] and the sterically demanding &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HDippNacNac (Dipp: 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) or with [(Ph3P)AuCl] as a derivative of a ligand&#8208;stabilized noble metal. The Ca(0)&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;driven reactions result in the novel compounds [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] (1) with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] (2) with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 (3) with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold. Ca(0) nanoparticles and the compounds 1&#8211;3 are characterized by electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (single crystals, powders), spectroscopy (IR, UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, EPR), and computation. Exemplarily, the formation of 1&#8211;3 points to the potential of nanosized alkaline&#8208;earth metals for chemical syntheses and the different reactivity of nanosized and bulk metals.

         <title>Inverting Palladium&#8211;Phosphorus Lewis Pair Formation: Phosphonium Acting as Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic phosphonium&#8208;palladium(0) complexes were synthesized using an ambiphilic phosphorus&#8208;based ligand. A strong Z&#8208;type interaction was identified by DFT calculations (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM analyses), surpassing the strength of classical L&#8208;type P&#9472;Pd bonds. The pronounced Pd(0) stabilization facilitates mild P&#9472;C coupling reaction, showcasing the effect of Z&#8208;type ligands on reductive elimination in transition metal mediated transformations. 








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based ligands are prototypical L&#8208;type donors. Here, we introduce a Lewis acidic phosphonium cation that engages in unprecedented Z&#8208;type coordination to palladium(0). The resulting Pd&#8594;P(V) interactions are structurally unique and stronger than conventional L&#8208;type Pd&#9472;phosphine bonds, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, x&#8208;ray crystallography, and quantum chemical analyses (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM). It enables the formation of rare L2Z&#8208;type Pd(0) complexes with distinctive optical and electronic properties. A notably mild P&#9472;C bond forming reaction suggests an overlooked role of Z&#8208;type interactions for facilitating reductive elimination pathways.

         <title>Solubility, Speciation and Thermodynamics of PuCO3OH(cr) in Carbonate Containing NaCl Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline Pu(III) hydroxo carbonate, PuCO3OH(cr), was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions, and structurally characterized by Rietveld analysis and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Solubility experiments revealed a great thermodynamic stability of PuCO3OH(cr), that substantially enhances the predominance field of solid Pu(III).








Abstract
The solubility, aqueous speciation, and solid phase formation of trivalent plutonium, Pu(III) was investigated for the first time in pH near&#8208;neutral 0.10&#160;M NaCl solutions under the presence of carbonate at T&#160;=&#160;(23&#160;&#177;&#160;2)&#160;&#176;C in the frame of a comprehensive experimental study. Crystalline PuCO3OH(cr) was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of the binary hydroxide Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions and comprehensively characterized by VIS/NIR absorption spectroscopy, SEM/EDX, powder XRD and Rietveld analysis, and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Batch solubility experiments with PuCO3OH(cr) equilibrated in 0.10&#160;M NaCl&#8211;Na2CO3 solutions were performed from undersaturation as a function of pHm and followed over time for up to 90 days. A chemical model was derived and the corresponding thermodynamic constants evaluated. These novel data demonstrate that under specific conditions Pu(III) equilibrium concentrations are up to three orders of magnitude lower when controlled by the PuCO3OH(cr) compared to the concentration level defined by Pu(OH)3(am), and reveal a remarkable stabilization of the entire Pu(III) oxidation state in carbonate containing aqueous solutions. The relevance of the new data for geochemical modeling of environmental systems and nuclear waste repositories is discussed.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes by an Asymmetric Povarov Reaction&#8208;Enabled Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective desymmetrization method was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes by using chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed Povarov reaction followed by aromatization, yielding various quinoline&#8208;containing MPC rotaxanes with high enantioselectivities, including a complex MPC [3]rotaxane. Extensive control studies were conducted to elucidate the origin of mechanical planar chirality.








Abstract
Mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes are a type of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) characterized by their unique chiral structures and dynamic motion properties, which have shown significant potential in various chiral science research fields. However, the exploration of efficient catalytic enantioselective methods for synthesizing these chiral molecules is still largely underexplored. We here report an efficient method for asymmetric synthesis of MPC rotaxanes through an enantioselective desymmetrization strategy. By employing the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Povarov reaction, the symmetry of prochiral rotaxanes with a rotationally symmetric macrocycle was broken, which was followed by a one&#8208;pot oxidative aromatization step to yield various MPC rotaxanes with good yields and high enantioselectivities. Moreover, in cases where the one&#8208;pot procedure did not provide satisfactory enantioselectivities, a stepwise protocol was employed to produce both enantiomers of MPC rotaxanes with excellent enantioselectivities, highlighting the practicability of this method. Extensive studies were performed to elucidate the origin of mechanical planar chirality within this method, which was postulated to arise from the synergistic interplay between the excellent enantioselectivity in generating point stereogenicity during the asymmetric Povarov reaction and the preferential selection of the mechanical geometric conformer of substrates during this process.

         <title>Deciphering Mn2+ Solvation and Interfacial Chemistry for Rechargeable Nonaqueous Mn&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy combining 2&#8208;methoxyethylamine (MOEA)&#8208;regulated Mn2+ solvation environment and indium nitride (InN)&#8208;enabled electrode interfacial engineering is implemented, improving the kinetics and reversibility of Mn plating/stripping in Mn&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Manganese emerges as a compelling metal anode for multivalent ion batteries given its favorable redox potential (&#8722;1.18&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode), high theoretical specific capacity (976 mAh g&#8722;1), and large abundance. However, its practical deployment is hindered by kinetic challenges, including strong Mn2+ solvation effects, electron repulsion from the half&#8208;filled 3d orbital, and surface passivation of oxide layer, which collectively contribute to excessive overpotential during the Mn plating/stripping process. To address these challenges, herein, we propose a synergistic strategy integrating Mn2+ solvation regulation using 2&#8208;methoxyethylamine (MOEA) and electrode interfacial engineering with indium nitride (InN). Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that MOEA&#8208;regulated Mn2+ solvation sheath reduces the energy barrier associated with charge transfer, while InN&#8208;coated Mn anode leverages abundant nucleation sites to facilitate Mn deposition. These concerted effects enable remarkable plating/stripping stability of Mn||Mn symmetric cells over 3400 h under 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Full cells pairing Mn anodes with pyrene&#8211;4,5,9,10&#8211;tetraone (PTO) cathodes further validate the strategy's efficacy, delivering a specific capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling for 400 cycles. This work provides fundamental insights into Mn2+ solvation and interfacial chemistry for rechargeable Mn&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Precise Pore Engineering at Picometer Scale on Nanofluidic Membrane for Efficient Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of HBF membranes with their pore sizes precisely tuned by altering anion linkers (SiF62&#8722;, GeF62&#8722; and TiF62&#8722;, size difference &lt; 1&#160;&#197;) were successfully fabricated for efficient H2 purification.








Abstract
Hydrogen, a carbon&#8208;free energy carrier is mainly produced through methane steam reforming, generating CO2 as the primary byproduct alongside H2O and CH4, complicating efficient hydrogen purification. Nanofluidic Hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HBF) membranes are promising for gas separation, while methods to precisely tailor pores for enhance performance remain scarce. Herein, a series of HBF membranes (SIFHBF&#8208;Cu, GeFHBF&#8208;Cu and TIFHBF&#8208;Cu) are successfully fabricated for H2 purification. Pore size is precisely tuned at the picometer scale (&lt; 1&#160;&#197;) by altering the anion linkers (SiF62&#8722;, GeF62&#8722; and TiF62&#8722;), enabling efficient H2 purification through the synergy between subtle window adjustments and F&#8208;site&#8208;enhanced CO2 affinity. The SIFHBF&#8208;Cu membrane combines the optimal size&#8208;exclusion and strongest HBF&#8208;CO2 interactions, exhibiting excellent H2/CO2 selectivity (501) and ternary gas separation (H2/CO2: 477, H2/CH4: 557), with stable performance under dry/wet conditions. This study provides a strategy for ultra&#8208;precise pore engineering, showing potential for other challenging separations like seawater desalination and isomer separation.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Bridged Biphasic Molybdenum Carbide Interfaces: A Synergistic Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the effectiveness of the synergistic adsorption/desorption/catalysis mechanism in enabling a solid&#8211;solid conversion pathway for Li&#8211;Se batteries. This article not only addresses the issue of solid&#8211;solid conversion kinetics in Li&#8211;Se batteries, but also realizes a paradigm shift from material design to reaction pathway through the &#8220;atomic bridging&#8208;multiphase synergy&#8221; strategy, opening up a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.








Abstract
Transition metal catalysts are key to developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8208;Se) batteries. Herein, we report a rationally designed Ni&#8208;bridged biphasic molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) with a multi&#8208;interface structure that exposes abundant active sites and significantly enhances the electrochemically reversibility of Li&#8211;Se batteries under high current operation. The synergistic integration of catalytic and conductive functions facilitates the rapid deposition and conversion of Se/Li2Sex, effectively preventing electrode passivation caused by inactive accumulation during high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling. Furthermore, Ni serves dual roles as a structural bridge to link Mo2C lattice and an electronic modulator to optimize the d&#8208;orbital configuration of Mo, thereby maximizing the catalytic efficiency of functionalized Mo2C. The synergistic effects of adsorption, desorption, and catalysis enable the rationally designed metal carbide/Se electrode to promote not only the rapid conversion of long&#8208;chain Li2Sen species but also the solid&#8211;solid transformation of Li2Se2 into Li2Se. As a result, the electrode achieves full&#8208;process catalytic conversion in Li&#8211;Se batteries, delivering excellent cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance. Even under high Se loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the electrode delivers an initial capacity of 400&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C. These results highlight the effectiveness of the synergistic adsorption/desorption/catalysis mechanism in enabling a fast solid&#8211;solid conversion pathway for Li&#8211;Se batteries.

         <title>Directing the Electrochemical C&#9472;N Coupling Toward Efficient Amide Synthesis via Ammonia Activation&#8208;Mediated Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ammonia&#8208;activation mediated pathway is presented to favor the oxidative C&#9472;N coupling necessary for formamide electrosynthesis using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks. This manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH2 species, which exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of unfavorable aldehyde intermediate.








Abstract
Electrochemically oxidative C&#9472;N coupling using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks offers a sustainable alternative for the chemosynthesis of amide organonitrogens. The achievements of high activity and selectivity yet remains challenging via the conventional alcohol oxidation pathway. Here, we present an alternative ammonia&#8208;activation mediated pathway to favor the electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling necessary. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations untangle that this manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH2 species, which then efficiently couple with alcohol species to form C&#9472;N bonds. This alternative C&#9472;N coupling pathway exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of aldehyde intermediate, thereby preventing unfavorable overoxidation. As a result, this pathway achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 50.1% and a carbon selectivity of 87.6% for efficient formamide electrosynthesis over a NiCuRu&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, with a productivity of 557.2&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Such electrosynthetic approach further exhibit the universality of waste biomass/plastics&#8208;driven carbon feedstocks, achieving considerable Faradaic efficiencies of 32%&#8211;60%.

&lt;p&gt;An ammonia-activation mediated pathway is presented to favor the oxidative C&#9472;N coupling necessary for formamide electrosynthesis using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks. This manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species, which exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of unfavorable aldehyde intermediate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically oxidative C&#9472;N coupling using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks offers a sustainable alternative for the chemosynthesis of amide organonitrogens. The achievements of high activity and selectivity yet remains challenging via the conventional alcohol oxidation pathway. Here, we present an alternative ammonia-activation mediated pathway to favor the electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling necessary. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations untangle that this manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species, which then efficiently couple with alcohol species to form C&#9472;N bonds. This alternative C&#9472;N coupling pathway exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of aldehyde intermediate, thereby preventing unfavorable overoxidation. As a result, this pathway achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 50.1% and a carbon selectivity of 87.6% for efficient formamide electrosynthesis over a NiCuRu-based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, with a productivity of 557.2&#160;&#181;mol cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Such electrosynthetic approach further exhibit the universality of waste biomass/plastics-driven carbon feedstocks, achieving considerable Faradaic efficiencies of 32%&#8211;60%. Techno-economic analysis confirms the potential profitability of using renewable electricity input, highlighting the significant advantages of green chemical manufacturing for sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of a Heme&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Catalyzing Nitrogen&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Formation in Kinamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, Alp1J, was identified as the catalyst that installs N&#9472;N bond in kinamycin biosynthesis. Alp1J forms a stable complex with ferredoxin Alp1I, which is essential for activity. Together they convert l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite into a hydrazine intermediate through a four&#8208;electron reductive pathway. The discovery establishes a platform for genome mining and synthetic biology aimed at novel N&#9472;N&#8208;containing therapeutics.








Abstract
A nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#9472;N) bond is a core feature of diverse natural products with interesting structural and biological properties. Kinamycin and lomaiviticin, featuring a diazobenzo[b]fluorene core, exhibit exceptional potency as chemotherapeutic agents. However, the N&#9472;N bond forming step in their biosynthesis has remained elusive. Through extensive mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we herein report that Alp1J, belonging to a new family of heme&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyzes the N&#9472;N bond formation in kinamycin biosynthesis. Interestingly, Alp1J forms a stable complex with its partner ferredoxin Alp1I, which can protect the cofactors and is critical for the N&#9472;N bond formation activity. With its partner ferredoxin, Alp1J catalyzes formation of the hydrazine intermediate directly from l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite by a pathway involving four&#8208;electron reduction. Our findings expand the knowledge of enzymatic N&#9472;N bond formation and show the potential for the discovery and development of novel N&#9472;N bond containing natural products through genome mining and synthetic biology.

Perched in equilibrium upon the T4&#8208;CdCu cluster, a balancing bird symbolizes the optimal balance between kinetics and thermodynamics achieved by the semiconductor cluster catalyst under visible&#8208;light excitation. In their Research Article (e202509764), Tao Wu et&#160;al. demonstrate that this equilibrium enables highly efficient and selective activation of inert substrates&#8212;such as non&#8208;activated arenes and aryl halides&#8212;delivering unprecedented photocatalytic performance under mild reaction conditions.

A rollercoaster illustrates the competing pathways of para&#8208;substituted arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches during thermal Z/E isomerization. In their Research Article (e202514433), the groups of Leticia Gonz&#225;lez and Marko Mihovilovic show how the substituent directs the track: electron&#8208;donating groups favour a nonadiabatic rotational track via the lowest triplet state, while electron&#8208;withdrawing groups follow a conventional ground&#8208;state inversion track.

The cover shows an artistic interpretation of how bimetallic nanowire arrays are fabricated using block copolymer film templates. The tornado represents the mixing of metal precursors that impregnate the poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) domains. The nanowires are illustrated as periodically arranged flowerbeds, with octahedral Co(CN)63&#8722; as blue, six&#8208;petal flowers, and square&#8208;planar PdCl42&#8722; as four&#8208;petal, red flowers. Details are described in the Research Article (e202512695) by Roy Shenhar et&#160;al.

In their Research Article (e202513719), William J. Brittain et al. present the reaction cycle of a tetrafluoroazobenzene (TFA)&#8208;spiropyran (SP) chromophore. Green light selectively isomerizes TFA. SP ring&#8208;opening generates a transient phenolate intermediate, which dramatically accelerates the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of TFA by factors ranging from 102 to 106. This process is controlled by SP stimuli. This dynamic behavior is depicted as a molecular race along the &#8220;AZOBAHN&#8221;&#8211;a high&#8208;speed track where the usual limits of chemical reaction rates no longer apply.

A defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese molecular catalyst was designed to determine the water&#8208;binding and &#8208;activating sites of birnessite at the atomic level, which is key for the high oxygen&#8208;evolving activity of manganese oxides electrocatalysts. Blocking those active sites, in contrast, is profoundly destructive of their catalytic capability. Details are reported by Gang Wu et al. in their Communication (e202511664).

         <title>From Light to Cure: Precision Phototherapies for Antibiotic&#8208;Refractory Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Bacterial biofilms, formidable barriers to antimicrobial resistance, are prime targets for phototherapies: PTT (local hyperthermia) and PDT (ROS generation). This review examines these approaches and their combinatorial strategies, addressing clinical translation challenges and advancing antibiotic&#8208;independent infection management.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms serve as formidable barriers in antimicrobial therapy and are central to the emergence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance. Their compact extracellular polymeric matrix, metabolic heterogeneity, and quorum&#8208;sensing&#8211;mediated resistance gene expression collectively endow biofilms with exceptional defense against conventional antibiotics. This review highlights the structural&#8208;functional complexity of biofilms and focuses on emerging phototherapeutic strategies&#8212;photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;as promising biofilm&#8208;targeted approaches. PTT employs near&#8208;infrared light to induce localized hyperthermia, disrupting bacterial membranes and enhancing drug penetration. PDT generates reactive oxygen species via photoactivated photosensitizers, leading to oxidative destruction of both cells and extracellular polymeric substances. These strategies offer metabolic independence, precise spatiotemporal control, and efficacy against dormant pathogens. Recent advances in smart nanoplatforms enable the integration of PTT/PDT with responsive drug delivery, imaging guidance, and immune modulation, achieving multimodal, precision antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, synergistic combinations with enzymatic degradation, immune intervention, and antibiotics show promise in treating chronic and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. We conclude by outlining translational challenges and strategic directions for clinical application, underscoring the potential of phototherapy to reshape infection management beyond antibiotic dependence.

         <title>Harnessing Phenonium Ions in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenonium ions have frequently been viewed as intermediates of theoretical interest, but whose synthetic utility was limited. This minireview outlines how physical&#8208;organic characterization has led to a better understanding of controlling their formation, which has resulted in modern strategies to form phenonium ions straightforwardly and use them in a synthetically useful manner.








Abstract
Whereas phenonium ions have been known for decades, their use in synthesis has been surprisingly scarce. This might be attributed to the difficulty in taming their formation and reactivity. However, by considering the physical&#8208;organic properties of phenonium species, through careful design of substrates, or the use of defined reagents/promoter systems, several applications have emerged in recent years to overcome those challenges. This minireview encompasses key recent strategies to generate those highly reactive cationic intermediates in line with their physicochemical properties, with special emphasis on mechanistic aspects, regioselectivity, and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Lower Critical Solution Temperature Active Supramolecular &#960;&#8208;Systems for Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we discuss Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) active supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for designing thermoresponsive smart windows, molecular thermometers, and biomedical systems. A critical analysis of such materials and their mechanistic understanding is important for future developments. This minireview outlines both the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems have emerged as an essential requirement for a wide range of smart applications in material sciences and biology. Among various responses, thermal response is a common functional characteristic of macromolecular and supramolecular systems. For example, polyacrylamides and their variants are known to exhibit a phenomenon called lower critical solution temperature (LCST) under aqueous conditions, which is a heat&#8208;induced phase change from a transparent to opaque state. Similarly, numerous amphiphilic supramolecular systems are known to exhibit LCST properties. &#960;&#8208;Conjugated molecules are emerging as preferred building blocks for the construction of LCST active supramolecular materials owing to their inherent electronic and optical properties, which are sensitive to temperature variations. A variety of amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;systems have been reported for the creation of dynamic and adaptive LCST materials, and a combined analysis of such materials is important for further developments. In this minireview, we describe how researchers have exploited the LCST property of supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for various smart applications, such as smart windows and nanothermometers, and discuss their future potential and challenges.

&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive supramolecular systems have emerged as an essential requirement for a wide range of smart applications in material sciences and biology. Among various responses, thermal response is a common functional characteristic of macromolecular and supramolecular systems. For example, polyacrylamides and their variants are known to exhibit a phenomenon called lower critical solution temperature (LCST) under aqueous conditions, which is a heat-induced phase change from a transparent to opaque state. Similarly, numerous amphiphilic supramolecular systems are known to exhibit LCST properties. &#960;-Conjugated molecules are emerging as preferred building blocks for the construction of LCST active supramolecular materials owing to their inherent electronic and optical properties, which are sensitive to temperature variations. A variety of amphiphilic &#960;-systems have been reported for the creation of dynamic and adaptive LCST materials, and a combined analysis of such materials is important for further developments. In this minireview, we describe how researchers have exploited the LCST property of supramolecular &#960;-systems for various smart applications, such as smart windows and nanothermometers, and discuss their future potential and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Responsible Use of Kinematic Models: Correspondence on &#8220;Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry&#8221;</title>

Kinematic models offer useful estimates of maximum energy output in ball milling, provided they are applied with accurate parameters and appropriate caution of the model's assumptions and limitations.








Abstract
In their recent article, Jafter et&#160;al. present &#8220;refined&#8221; kinematic models for planetary and mixer mills. While the improvement of such models is a valuable pursuit, we find that aspects of the presentation and application of these models raise concerns. The authors modify an existing planetary mill model, yet the altered equations offer no clear advantage and obscure the underlying milling dynamics. The mixer mill model is similar to known models, but includes additional parameters, such as an empirical scaling factor, that lack theoretical justification. Furthermore, the models are applied using estimated or hypothetical values for important milling parameters, contributing to overestimations of the energy metrics. Rather than dismissing the use of kinematic models, we emphasize the importance of applying them with care by using accurate input parameters, being aware of their assumptions and limitations, and interpreting their outputs in the context of what the energy metrics represent (maximum energies released from impacts). When employed responsibly, kinematic models can provide valuable insight, and thus, we encourage a more rigorous and transparent application of these models to support the broader goal of reproducibility in mechanochemistry.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Ubiquitin Probes Capture the Sulfenylated State of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic ubiquitin&#8208;based probe, Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2, was developed to selectively label sulfenylated deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). The probe demonstrated high specificity in vitro and enabled the identification of 13 oxidized DUBs in H2O2&#8208;treated 293T cell lysates via label&#8208;free proteomics, offering a new approach to study redox&#8208;regulated DUB activity.








Abstract
Activity&#8208;based ubiquitin probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) are powerful tools for studying the functional landscape of deubiquitinases (DUBs). While most existing Ub probes have focused on examining the native state of DUBs, oxidative stress, especially in cancer and inflammatory contexts, can oxidize the catalytic cysteine of DUBs, significantly altering their activity. Here, we developed three novel ubiquitin&#8208;based activity probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) to selectively trap the sulfenylated form of deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). These probes employ ubiquitin as the recognition element and incorporate distinct warheads: an electrophilic norbornene moiety (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;NMA) or dimedone&#8208;derived cyclic C&#8208;nucleophiles (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2), enabling covalent capture of oxidized cysteine residues. Of these, Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 successfully labeled DUB&#8208;SOH, highlighting the importance of proper probe&#8208;substrate interaction for effective trapping. Optimization of the ubiquitin length showed that the Ub74 variant displayed enhanced affinity toward DUB&#8208;SOH. Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 enabled enrichment and identification of DUB&#8208;SOH targets via immunocapture and label&#8208;free quantitative proteomics. Collectively, these sulfenic acid&#8208;targeting Ub&#8208;ABPs represent versatile tools for elucidating redox&#8208;dependent DUB regulation, with potential applications in understanding redox dysregulation in disease contexts.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of a Diterpene Synthase for Chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E from Chryseobacterium Joostei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bacterial diterpene synthase CjCS for chryseojoostenes was mechanistically characterised through labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and conversion of substrate analogs with blocked reactivity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to minor enzyme products, including chryseojoostene E, whose biosynthesis involves a long&#8208;range hydrogen shift that is also relevant to its EIMS fragmentation.








Abstract
A diterpene synthase from Chryseobacterium joostei was characterised and produces the five unique compounds chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E. Chryseojoostenes D and E were produced in too low amounts for isolation from the wildtype enzyme, but extensive site&#8208;directed mutagenesis resulted in an enzyme variant in which the production of these compounds was enhanced. The biosynthesis of the enzyme products was investigated in detail through a combined experimental and computational approach, indicating a complex hydrogen scrambling during terpene cyclisation and a long&#8208;range proton shift towards chryseojoostene E. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a similar long range hydrogen shift is involved in the formation of an even fragment ion (m/z 216), characterising the unique chemistry of the chryseojoostene skeleton. Further insights into the cyclisation mechanism were obtained by enzymatic conversion of two substrate analogs with reduced reactivity.

         <title>Controlling the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Reduction Reactions Through Sequential Anion Insertion and Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction reactions allow the preparation of metastable materials containing low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metal cations. By adopting a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regioselectivity of these reactions can be modified, allowing the connectivity of the transition&#8208;metal coordination polyhedra in the resulting materials (1D vs. 2D) to be controlled.








Abstract
Topochemical reduction of the n&#160;=&#160;2 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide, LaSr2CoRuO7, yields LaSr2CoRuO5.3, a phase containing (Co/Ru)O4 squares which share corners to form 1D infinite double&#8208;chains. In contrast, fluorination of LaSr2CoRuO7 yields the oxyfluoride LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5, which can then be reduced to form LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5. This reduced oxyfluoride is almost isoelectronic with LaSr2CoRuO5.3, but LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 has a crystal structure in which the (Co/Ru)O4 squares are connected into 2D infinite sheets. Thus, by following a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regiochemistry of topochemical reduction reactions can be modified, and compounds with different transition&#8208;metal&#8208;centre interconnectivity can be prepared. Both LaSr2CoRuO5.3 and LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 adopt glassy magnetic states at low temperature, but the magnetic interactions present in LaSr2CoRuO5.3 appear to be significantly stronger than those in LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5, attributable to the differing dimensionality of the transition&#8208;metal connectivity. The structural features of LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5 that modify the regioselectivity of the topochemical reduction reaction appear to be common to many fluorinated Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxides, suggesting this fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce strategy could be used to prepare a range of &#8220;infinite&#8208;layer&#8221; reduced phases which cannot be made by direct reduction of Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide precursors.

         <title>Bullvalene&#8208;Containing Molecular Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalenes (BVs) undergo rapid pericyclic rearrangements between a network of constitutional isomers with a variety of different shapes. Their inherent covalent disorder lends them to form molecular glasses. We find that their inclusion in the structures of glass&#8208;forming materials results in an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient.








Abstract
Organic molecular glasses are attractive matrices to disperse active ingredients in pharmaceuticals or electronic devices. Typically, they i) have lower glass transition temperatures than inorganic or polymeric glasses, making them easier to process, and ii) are less prone to phase segregation from other organic active materials. However, there is a dearth of functional groups that are known to induce glass formation in preference to crystallization. We have investigated the relationship between the shapeshifting isomerism of heterodisubstituted bullvalenes (BVs) and their properties as amorphous molecular glasses. Substituting a constitutionally dynamic BV unit in place of the 1,4&#8208;phenylene motif in the molecular structures of two well&#8208;known liquid crystal mesogens, 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;butylbiphenyl, produces materials that readily form glasses. The properties of the two glasses are compared to analogous glasses with fixed constitutions. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), we show that, unlike the fixed&#8208;structure glasses, the BV&#8208;containing molecular glasses fracture at low temperatures, which is indicative of them having larger thermal expansion coefficients. This article highlights the capability of shapeshifting building blocks to induce glass formation and to alter the physical properties of the resulting molecular materials, producing macroscopic effects that are observable by eye.

         <title>Programmable Vertical Expansion of Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Frameworks via Molecular Pillar Engineering</title>

Achieving &#197;ngstrom&#8208;precise interlayer control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains elusive. We demonstrate water&#8208;based engineering of bilayer SOFs using length&#8208;tunable bipyridine pillars (L2/L3). Coordination&#8208;driven assembly with a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF yields crystalline bilayers with thicknesses of 5.4&#160;and 6.7&#160;nm&#8212;validated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This pillar&#8208;length&#8208;to&#8208;spacing correlation enables sub&#8208;nm precision, opening avenues for tailored interlayer environments.








Abstract
Achieving quantitative control over interlayer spacing in multilayer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a&#160;molecular pillar engineering strategy&#160;enabling programmable vertical expansion of bilayer architectures. By designing elongated bipyridine pillars&#160;L2/L3&#160;(3.0/4.4&#160;nm) with hydrophilic side chains, we transform a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF (ml&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF, 1.8&#160;nm) into bilayers with&#160;precision&#8208;tuned&#160;thicknesses:&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;2&#160;(5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm) and&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;3&#160;(6.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;nm). Synchrotron small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) lattice imaging, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm structural regularity with&#160;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level accuracy&#160;in layer spacing. Crucially, we establish a&#160;linear correlation between pillar length and interlayer distance, while multivalency&#8208;driven assembly ensures&#160;&gt;93% bilayer selectivity. This work pioneers quantitative 3D engineering in 2D SOFs, opening avenues for tailored nanoconfined environments.

         <title>A Facile and Efficient Route to Achieve Polythiophene&#8208;Based Nanoparticles With Various Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythiophene&#8208;based nanoparticles with abundant morphologies are efficiently fabricated by template synthesis strategy, which involves the fabrication of morphology precursors via PISA technique and their further oxidative polymerization. This strategy creates opportunities to obtain conjugated polymer nanoparticles with tunable morphologies and offers a powerful approach for large&#8208;scale fabrication to expand their application in future.








Abstract
Polythiophene&#8208;based nanoparticles (PTNPs), a prominent class of conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) with remarkable optical and electronic properties, have gained significant attention in applications such as electronics and bioimaging. However, current methods in generating PTNPs have run into obstacles including low variety of morphologies, poor reproducibility, and low preparation efficiency, restricting their further application. In this study, we report a facile and efficient fabrication strategy based on template synthesis method. This method combines polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) for the preparation of morphology precursors (PTN&#8208;templates) with subsequent oxidative polymerization to realize the construction of PTNPs. By systematically regulating composition, charge characteristics of hydrophilic segments, and solids content of the polymerization mixtures during RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA, a wide variety of PTN&#8208;templates with various morphologies were obtained. The successful synthesis of PTNPs with representative morphologies was confirmed through morphology retention, the formation of polythiophene chains, and the observed red shift in UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. In summary, we have established important guidelines for efficient fabrication of PTNPs with diverse morphologies, which opens up new avenues for the synthesis of next&#8208;generation conjugated polymer nanomaterials and offers the opportunity for the large&#8208;scale preparation of conjugated polymer nanomaterials.

         <title>Transforming Crowded Coacervates into Multi&#8208;Compartmental Hybrid Microreactors for Practical Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Multicompartmental protocell models with complex architectures are constructed through a versatile structural transformation from membrane&#8208;free coacervates to robust hybrid microreactors, which enables spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency.








Abstract
Advancing the design and construction of artificial protocells with organized complexity, diverse functionality and practical applicability is urgently demanded in vitro synthetic biology and bioengineering but remains a grand challenge. Here, we present a versatile Pickering emulsion&#8208;based encapsulation approach to transform membraneless coacervate compartments into robust multicompartmental hybrid microreactors, which concurrently assimilate the expected attributes of hierarchically compartmentalized structure, molecularly crowded environment, selectively permeable ability and mechanically reinforced stability. Single or multiple biological and non&#8208;biological catalytic species can be spatially sequestered in specific domains of the hybrid microreactor, enabling spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency. As proof of concept, we not only demonstrate the markedly improved catalytic activity (1.9&#8211;9.2 folds enhancement), strengthened thermostability (up to 100&#160;&#176;C) and impressive long&#8208;term durability (1600&#160;h) of the obtained microreactors in lipase&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of alcohol medicine intermediates, but also showcase their superior capability in processing chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade of ketone hydrogenation&#8208;kinetic resolution and multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade of oxidation reactions. Macromolecular crowding and confinement effects arising from structural features of the hybrid microreactors are identified as the dominant factors for the promotion of catalytic functions.

         <title>Polymerization of L&#8208;Arginine into Nanomicelles for Immunometabolic Engineering of Adoptive Macrophages in Solid Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of regulating immunometabolism of adoptive macrophages in vivo is reported by synthesizing L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based polymeric nanomicelles and integrating them within macrophages (PLANO@M&#248;). PLANO@M&#248; could display augmented tumor&#8208;killing potential and induce robust immune response. In the 4T1 murine model, PLANO@M&#248; showed an obvious inhibition effect on tumor progression.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive cell therapy is highly dependent on the status and function of the infused cells. However, insufficient nutrient availability within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) often impedes these cells from fully exerting their cytotoxic potential against solid tumors. Here, we present a strategy of integrating adoptively transferred macrophages with intracellular nutrient depots composed of L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based nanomicelles to provide a sustainable supply of essential metabolite and optimize the cellular activity in the nutrient&#8208;deprived TME. Also, the nanomicelles were coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles to endow them with immunomodulatory capability, which could activate macrophages toward anti&#8208;tumor phenotypes and resist immune suppression. We showed that our approach significantly strengthened the tumor&#8208;killing potential of macrophages, induced robust immune responses, and effectively inhibited solid tumor growth compared to the administration of an equal dose of macrophages without immunometabolic modulation. This work provides a method for orchestrating the behavior of transferred cells in vivo, offering a promising strategy to better unleash the potential of adoptive cell therapies against solid tumors.

         <title>P450 Enzyme LyoI Performs Hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bifuran Oxidation in the Polyether Ionophore Lysocellin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a study of the biosynthesis of the polyether ionophore lysocellin, the P450 enzyme LyoI was found to catalyze a rare oxidation of a hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran moiety to its hemiketal form. The oxidation was identified as the key for unlocking the bioactivity of lysocellin. The sequence of LyoI lacks a key acidic residue, essential for its oxidative capabilities, which was utilized to identify a range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes.








Abstract
Polyether ionophores are potent antimicrobials, albeit also cytotoxic against mammalian cells. We have identified several polyether ionophores containing a common hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol (hemiketal) moiety, which cannot be derived from the canonical biosynthetic steps observed for the compound class, suggesting an unusual oxidative transformation. To identify the responsible enzyme, we applied CRISPR&#8211;BEST to knock out genes in the lysocellin&#8208;producing strain S. longwoodensis. This allowed us to propose the first annotation of the lysocellin biosynthetic gene cluster and identify the responsible P450 enzyme, LyoI, through reconstitution of the function in vivo. LyoI knockout provided access to the non&#8208;oxidized precursor (pre&#8208;lysocellin) which allowed both in vitro validation of the unusual direct hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran to hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol oxidation and investigation of the impact on biological activity. Interestingly, absence of the LyoI&#8208;mediated oxidation greatly reduced the biological potency of the compound. Closer investigation of the sequence revealed that LyoI lacks a key conserved acidic residue, which proved essential for the unusual oxidative function of the enzyme. Through a sequence similarity network of LyoI, we were able to identify a wide range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes, highlighting the possibilities of a biosynthesis&#8208;focused approach to discovering novel enzymes.

         <title>&#8220;Twisted&#8221; Terpolymer Donor Enabling High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new strategy to enhance the stretchability and photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) simultaneously by twisting the conjugated backbone of polymer donors. Efficient OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% with a remarkable crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 23.8% are fabricated. Moreover, the intrinsically stretchable OSCs (is&#8208;OSCs) achieved a PCE of 14.2% and excellent stretchability with a strain at PCE80% of 31.0%, ranking among the highest values.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (is&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for next&#8208;generation wearable power generators. Currently, high&#8208;efficiency polymeric donor materials are based on rigid planar conjugated backbones, which limits their mechanical robustness and creates a trade&#8208;off between photovoltaic performance and stretchability. To simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness of is&#8208;OSCs, we develop a series of ductile PM&#8208;BOX% terpolymers by incorporating different amounts (X&#160;=&#160;5, 10, and 20) of 3&#8208;butyloctyl&#8208;thiophene (ThBO) units into PM6 backbone. The BO alkyl side chains appended on Th&#8208;BO units induce a more significant twist in the backbone compared to PM6, which increases the disordered contents and facilitates the stress dissipation, hence enhancing the mechanical stretchability. While the conjugated thiophene unit preserves the &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, maintaining efficient charge transport. As a result, the PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based devices outperform the PM6&#8208;based ones, achieving a higher PCE of 18.3% and a superior crack&#8208;onset strain of 23.8%. Additionally, PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based is&#8208;OSCs reach a PCE of 14.2% with an excellent PCE retention (80% of its initial PCE at 31.0% strain), marking one of the highest values for is&#8208;OSCs. This twisted terpolymer design strategy paves a novel way for designing efficient polymer donors with excellent stretchability for the application in is&#8208;OSCs.

Robust Zr&#8208;MOFs synthesized via aqueous solid&#8208;state routes enabling one&#8208;pot enzyme encapsulation and enhanced catalytic stability in harsh conditions.








Abstract
Conventional syntheses of robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) rely on harsh solvothermal conditions, precluding the inclusion of fragile functionalities such as enzymes or organisms. Therefore, developing routes to such stable frameworks under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a mild aqueous solid&#8208;state crystallization (SSC) strategy that enables Zr&#8208;MOF assembly at ambient temperature. This approach transforms an amorphous precursor into a crystalline framework via water&#8208;mediated dynamic ligand exchange. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal an acid&#8208;catalyzed associative substitution mechanism at Zr6 nodes, in which formate modulators are protonated and displaced by fumarate linkers, driving MOF&#8208;801 crystallization without external heating or organic solvent. We further apply this SSC method to other Zr&#8208;MOFs, including functionalized UiO&#8208;66 analogues, establishing it as a general model for ambient MOF assembly. This amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline transformation represents a new synthetic paradigm for constructing stable porous frameworks under biocompatible conditions and enables the integration of sensitive biomolecules (e.g., enzymes) into robust MOFs. In addition, this method for MOF&#8208;801 formation is universally adaptable for encapsulating various proteins. The enzyme@Zr&#8208;MOF composites significantly enhance enzyme stability in catalytic reactions involving acidic products, demonstrating the necessity of robust Zr&#8208;MOF shells.

         <title>Semiconductor Cluster with High Reduction Potential and Efficient Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Activation of Inert Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideal semiconductor&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalytic platform is exemplified to clarify the critical balance between kinetics and thermodynamics in inert substrate activation from the perspective of the Marcus charge transfer theory. This balance endows the proposed protocol with remarkable versatility, enabling the dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and hydrodehalogenation of challenging aryl/alkyl chlorides and fluorides, along with arylation and amination under visible light.








Abstract
Photoredox catalysis is an essential component of modern organic synthesis. However, current photocatalysts face the challenge of simultaneously requiring strong redox potentials and efficient charge transfer to meet the thermodynamic and kinetic demands of photoinduced electron transfer processes. Herein, we present an excellent reactivity mode for photocatalysis based on semiconductor clusters, exploiting the ideal Marcus parabola to couple potential and kinetic requirements. Our system demonstrates an exceptionally high negative reduction potential (Ered) (&#8722;2.94&#160;V versus SCE, on par with K0) and realizes efficient charge transfer&#8212;rapid charge separation (CS) and slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics. This duality endows the protocol with remarkable versatility by enabling the dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and reductive dehalogenation of challenging aryl/alkyl chlorides and aryl fluorides, as well as arylation and amination, with a high functional group tolerance under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Furthermore, this platform offers easy recyclability, supports gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and can be extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization and deuteration of drugs. This innovative catalytic platform provides a new approach for the photochemical activation of inert organic substrates and is foreseen to promote the development of radical reaction&#8208;based pharmaceutical synthesis.

         <title>Control Over S(VI) Stereogenicity for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfonimidoyl Derivatives by Isothiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Covalent Activation of Sulfur(VI) Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent activation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides via an isothiourea&#8208;derived sulfonimidoyl intermediate is disclosed for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic sulfonimidates. The enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates for efficient sulfur(VI)&#8208;phenolate exchange in the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides.








Abstract
In contrast to the notable advancements focusing on the preparation of optically enriched S(IV) frameworks in recent years, achieving catalyst stereocontrol over S(VI) stereogenicity to generate chiral S(VI) scaffolds remains a largely underexplored challenge. Herein, we document a new activation mode of isothiourea organocatalysis for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;chiral sulfonimidates. This method involves the covalent activation of racemic S(VI) sulfonimidoyl chlorides through the formation of a pivotal isothiourea&#8208;bound sulfonimidoyl intermediate. The newly formed S(VI)&#8208;based isothiourea reactive species further governs the subsequent asymmetric S&#9472;O bond formation to afford the chiral sulfonimidate products with high yields and selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the facile inversion of the tetrasubstituted S(VI) stereogenic center assisted by the chiral catalyst is crucial in the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) process. Notably, distinct from the extensively studied isothiourea catalysis focused on the activation of &#8220;C&#8221;&#8208;centered substrates, our method introduces a novel S&#8208;atom activation approach, enabling the efficient construction of S(VI) stereogenic centers. Furthermore, the obtained enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates in efficient sulfur&#8208;phenolate exchange for rapid access to diverse S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides, and their derivatives, with notable antimicrobial activity against various plant pathogens.

A in&#8208;situ polymerized interface is successfully constructed between solid polymer electrolytes and electrodes. Al(OTf)3 in the electrolyte initiates 1,3&#8208;dioxolane polymerization to lower interfacial impedance, while fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;derived CEI suppresses sulfurized polyacrylonitrile&#8217;s shuttle effect. This enables the Li&#8208;S battery to retain 90% capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have been regarded as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and low cost. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) as a cathode material has received wide interest due to the solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism, while the Li&#8208;SPAN cell performance has been limited by the notorious issue of lithium metal anode. Developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with favorable electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility is urgently desired. Herein, we demonstrate a dual&#8208;interface optimization strategy through in&#8208;situ polymerization interface construction, which synergistically enhances interfacial compatibility between the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and both the lithium metal anode and SPAN cathode. The initiator pre&#8208;buried in the SPE triggers the in&#8208;situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) at the interface, thereby greatly reducing the electrode/electrolyte interfacial impedance. Additionally, the released fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) into the poly&#8208;DOL interface could further reduce the impedance and enhance the interface stability during cycling, simultaneously preventing the dissolution of polysulfides, owing to the inorganic&#8208;rich and dense cathode electrolyte interphase formed on SPAN. As a result, the Li&#8208;SPAN cell could operate more than 200 cycles at 0.5C with a capacity retention of 90%. We believe that this strategy provides prospects for the development of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

Chiral (R&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 and (S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 metal halides crystallize in enantiomorphic helical space groups P61 and P65, respectively. The helical orientation of chiral molecules in the lattice arises due to strong N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and is visualized via sixfold symmetry. The crystals show mirror&#8208;image CD spectra (g&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and circularly polarized SHG with a dissymmetry factor (gCP&#8211;SHG) up to 0.44.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have emerged as a promising class of materials for spin&#8208;controlled optical and optoelectronic effects and related applications. Chiral hybrid metal halides generally crystallize in non&#8208;helical space groups. Herein, we report the discovery of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral (R/S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium cation) single crystals with enantiomorphic lattice helicity. The S&#8208;enantiomer of the chiral molecule induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P61 space group (right&#8208;handed, P&#8208;helix), while the R&#8208;enantiomer induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P65 space group (left&#8208;handed, M&#8208;helix). The chiral molecules induce the helical twist of inorganic units in the lattice through N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong electronic coupling between chiral molecules and SnBr62&#8722; subunits is responsible for the generation of chirality. The chiral crystals exhibit circular dicroism (CD) spectra with a high dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and no Cotton effect, maintaining the same CD sign throughout the spectrum. In addition, they exhibit broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) over a broad excitation range, with a gCP&#8208;SHG up to 0.44. Furthermore, we find that the alloying of Sn with Pb leads to a change in dimensionality from 0D to non&#8208;helical 1D structures. These crystals with helical lattices and interesting CD responses are expected to open new avenues for spin&#8208;controlled applications.

         <title>&#8220;Dual&#8208;Key&#8221;&#8208;Controlled Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanoprobe for Highly Precision Phototheranostics Under NIR&#8208;II Light Excitation</title>

This study developed an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe with nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, permitting highly specific near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects.








Abstract
The development of activatable optical probes has proved to be a promising approach to improve the accuracy of phototheranostics. However, most such probes are usually responsive to single pathological factor and visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I light upon activation, which restricts the theranostic specificity and tissue penetration depth, respectively. Herein, we develop a nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsive semiconducting polymer nanoprobe for activatable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Specifically, a weak electron acceptor (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;5,6&#8208;diamine, BT2NH2) has been conjugated with diketopyrrolopyrrole to construct the pathological factor&#8208;sensitive molecular probe. Upon the coactivation of NO and acidity, the BT2NH2 is oxidized to generate a strong electron acceptor (5H&#8208;[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;f]&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, BT3N), leading to the absorption enhancement in the NIR&#8208;II region. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate the successful activation of the probe toward activated macrophages, various cancer cells, drug&#8208;induced liver injury, and breast cancer to output enhanced NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic and photothermal signals, permitting highly specific PAI and PTT with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects. By virtue of the improved specificity and superior penetration depth, the dual&#8208;stimuli responsive NIR&#8208;II probe has broad prospects for precise visualization and intervention toward NO and acid&#8208;associated pathological and physiological events from deep tissues.

         <title>A Tertiary Amine&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Methylation&#8208;Mediated Steric and Electronic Synergy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N, N&#8208;dimethylurethane (NDMUE), which is formed by methylating the &#945;&#8208;H atoms on the urethane (UE) and N&#8208;methylurethane molecules, results in an increase in steric hindrance and the formation of a hyper&#8208;conjugated structure. This facilitates more anions to participate in Li+ coordination and enhances the stability of the lithium metal, enabling a 3.0&#8208;Ah LiFePO4||Li pouch cell with excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
The application of the amine&#8208;based solvents (AS) in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) electrolyte is hindered by the severe parasitic reactions between active hydrogen and Li metal. In this study, we synthesized a methylated AS (N, N&#8208;dimethylurethane, NDMUE), by replacing the reactive hydrogen with a methyl group. We further demonstrated its performance as a single&#8208;component solvent for LMB electrolytes. Its performance as a single&#8208;component solvent for LMB electrolytes was demonstrated. The methyl substitution was found to enhance steric hindrance and introduce a hyper&#8208;conjugated structure, Its weak solvent &#9472;Li+ interactions promote anion&#8208;dominated solvation, and facilitating controlled solvent reduction. This molecular modification leads to a mechanically robust bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal anode through the sequential reduction processes: the anion&#8208;driven reduction produced an inner inorganic layer, while the ester moiety contributed to an outer organic layer. Together, these layers effectively suppressed dendrite growth. As a result, we demonstrated outstanding cycling performance with a 3&#8208;Ah LiFePO4||Li pouch cell using the NDMUE&#8208;based electrolyte, retaining nearly 100% of its capacity after 273 cycles at 0.2 C. This work establishes a rational design strategy for amine&#8208;derived electrolytes and provides a fundamental framework for developing advanced electrolyte systems in durable LMBs.

         <title>Synergistic Construction of In Situ Self&#8208;Polymerized Interface and Localized pH Buffer Zone for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional electrolyte pH buffer, valerolactam, was developed to stabilize the zinc anode, regulate interfacial pH, self&#8208;polymerize into a robust SEI layer, and suppress polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical use is hindered by challenges such as Zn dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion, and polyiodide shuttle effect. In this study, valerolactam (VL) is employed as an organic pH buffer to address these issues. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that VL can regulate the electrolyte local pH while in situ polymerizing on the electrode surface to form a mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protection layer, effectively suppressing HER, corrosion, and dendrite growth. Furthermore, the introduction of VL significantly regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, and disrupts the inherent hydrogen bonding network, which enhances the electrochemical performance. As a result, a symmetric cell with VL&#8208;based electrolyte achieves impressive longevity under ultra&#8208;high current density (4000 cycles at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), 4.3 times higher than the counterpart in the conventional ZnSO4 electrolytes. Moreover, VL effectively suppresses polyiodide shuttle effect and improves electrochemical stability. Consequently, Zn&#8211;I2 full battery exhibits exceptional cycling stability, sustaining 26&#160;500 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.4%. Therefore, organic pH buffering engineering has been proved to be a promising strategy for achieving dendrite&#8208;free, shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Tuning Surface Concentrations of Building Units to Enable the Cathodic Deposition of Metastable ZIF&#8208;L Films for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic deposition enables the formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films, yet precise control of surface building&#8208;unit concentrations remain challenging. By finely tuning these concentrations, metastable ZIF&#8208;L membranes are obtained with high gas separation performance. This approach establishes a general strategy for regulating building units under negative bias, applicable to other surface&#8208;sensitive MOFs.








Abstract
Cathodic deposition is an emerging technique for the preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films. However, monitoring and controlling the concentrations of MOF building units (i.e., metal nodes and ligands) on the electrode surface remains challenging and has yet to be reported. This limitation greatly hinders the application of this technique to the synthesis of MOFs sensitive to building unit concentrations, such as the well&#8208;known metastable ZIF&#8208;L. Here, using the cathodic deposition of ZIF&#8208;L films as an example, we demonstrate how the surface metal node and ligand concentrations influence ZIF&#8208;L film generation by utilizing in situ pH measurements and theoretical calculations. Also, we propose a strategy to regulate the concentrations of these building units, enabling the straightforward and rapid cathodic deposition of thin ZIF&#8208;L films. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) post&#8208;modification, the electrochemically deposited ZIF&#8208;L films on commercial anodized alumina oxide (AAO) substrate exhibit good gas separation performance, achieving a H2/N2 selectivity of 19.4 and a H2 permeance exceeding 360 GPU (1 GPU&#160;=&#160;3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#8304; mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1 Pa&#8722;1).

         <title>Molecular Insights into Active Sites of Manganese Oxide Based Water Oxidation Eletrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Tri&#8208; and di&#8208;manganese model complexes are developed to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the former acts as a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4&#8208;e WOR to produce O2 while the latter exhibits marginal catalytic activity on WOR, suggesting that the defective tri&#8208;nuclear cubical motif is most likely the active site of MnOx electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnOx) are promising candidates for water oxidation catalysts. However, the true active centers remain elusive due to the dynamic nature of MnOx during electrolysis and/or activation, hindering progress in catalyst design and optimization. Herein, we aim to address such a challenge by preparing a defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex and a di&#8208;manganese complex to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex is a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4e&#8722; water oxidation to produce O2 with an optimal Faradic efficiency of 95% and an average rate of oxygen generation of 46.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest values of reported manganese&#8208;based molecular catalysts and is comparable with representative heterogeneous MnOx systems. In contrast, the di&#8208;manganese complex exhibits marginal catalytic activity. This work provides molecular insights into the true active centers of MnOx and aids in the precise design of more efficient MnOx water oxidation electrocatalysts.

         <title>Switching Enantioselectivity in Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase for the Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Deficient Aromatic d&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs) were engineered to switch enantioselectivity, enabling hydroamination for the direct synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AA). Structure&#8208;guided engineering provided PAL variants with broad substrate scope, high activity, and excellent d&#8208;selectivity, broadening the utility of PALs in asymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AAs) are valuable building blocks in drug discovery and peptide therapeutics, yet their direct and efficient biocatalytic synthesis remains a challenge. Here, we report the rational engineering of phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL) to enable asymmetric hydroamination for the enantioselective synthesis of d&#8208;aromatic amino acids. By targeting active&#8208;site residue L205, we identified variants capable of highly d&#8208;enantioselective hydroamination, with L205F enabling the transformation of electron&#8208;deficient aryl acrylates with &gt;99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The synthetic utility of this platform was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis of d&#8208;benzoxazole and substituted 2&#8208;pyridylalanines. Structural and mutational studies revealed distinct roles for the 4&#8208;methylideneimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;one (MIO) prosthetic group and active&#8208;site residues L205, Y64, and K397 in modulating enantioselectivity. These results enabled the identification of PbPAL variants with the opposite selectivity, such as L205V&#8208;K397A, which preferentially produce l&#8208;amino acids. This work broadens the utility of PALs as programmable biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Production with a Nearly 2% Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency via a Dedicated Construction of Redox Centers in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

NMFS&#8208;Cu showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. The single&#8208;atom Cu sites in NMFS&#8208;Cu promote the formation of Cu&#8208;&#956;&#8208;peroxide (Cu&#8208;O2&#8722;) and desorption of *H2O2, leading to an efficient 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR resulting in a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant widely used in a variety of industries. Photocatalytic generation of H2O2 from water and oxygen by sunlight is an appealing strategy compared to the high energy consumption of the industrial anthraquinone process. However, the low activity and selectivity of the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the photocatalytic process greatly restricts the H2O2 production efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that the redox centers in MOFs (NMFS&#8208;M, single&#8208;atom M linked to an iron&#8208;oxo cluster in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) by a molecular linker cysteine, M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for the production of H2O2 from water and oxygen. The optimal NMFS&#8208;Cu stably generates H2O2 under simulated sunlight irradiation with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency under AM1.5 spectrum and an apparent quantum yield of 19.6% at 420&#160;nm. Combined with density functional theory calculations, isotopic experiments, and advanced spectroscopic characterizations, the high photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the notably promoted sequential two&#8208;step ORR to H2O2 by forming &#956;&#8208;peroxide and desorption of *H2O2 at the single&#8208;atom Cu sites. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR, leading to a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.

Here, we demonstrated that the redox centers in MOFs (NMFS-M, single-atom M linked to an iron-oxo cluster in NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101(Fe) by a molecular linker cysteine, M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water and oxygen. The optimal NMFS-Cu stably generates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under simulated sunlight irradiation with a nearly 2% solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency under AM1.5 spectrum and an apparent quantum yield of 19.6% at 420&#160;nm. Combined with density functional theory calculations, isotopic experiments, and advanced spectroscopic characterizations, the high photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the notably promoted sequential two-step ORR to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by forming &#956;-peroxide and desorption of *H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the single-atom Cu sites. The in situ generated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR, leading to a boosted photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Electrocatalytic Coupling of Carbon Dioxide and Methanol for High&#8208;Efficiency Formic Acid Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation system employing CuBi cathode and NiCo anode enables efficient cogeneration of formic acid. The electron&#8208;rich Bi sites accelerate HCOO* formation, while low&#8208;coordination Co atoms enhance methanol oxidation. The coupled system delivers total Faradaic efficiencies of 189%&#8211;192% across 2.0&#8211;2.8 V, achieving sustainable and energy&#8208;efficient FA production.








Abstract
The coupling of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) presents a promising strategy for simultaneous cogeneration of formic acid (FA) at both cathode and anode. However, sluggish kinetics, low selectivity and efficiency hinder practical application. Herein, we demonstrate an integrated ECR||MOR system employing CuBi cathode and NiCo anode for energy&#8208;efficient FA cogeneration. The CuBi alloy achieves high Faradaic efficiencies (FE&#160;&gt;&#160;90%) for FA generation over an extensive potential range (&gt;400&#160;mV), attributed to the accelerated formation of HCOO* intermediates in facilitating FA production. Meanwhile, the NiCo alloy reached a remarkable FE of 97.5% for FA generation at 1.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, benefiting from rapid HCOO* intermediate formation that effectively mitigates CO toxicity. This unique system delivered a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 2.07&#160;V, representing a substantial reduction of 320&#160;mV compared to water electrolysis. Across a wide operational voltage window (2.0&#8211;2.8&#160;V), the system consistently delivered total Faradaic efficiencies ranging between 189% and 192%, alongside exceptional FA production capacities surpassing 400&#160;g kWh&#8722;1, which significantly outperformed traditional methods (&#8764;220&#160;g kWh&#8722;1). This work provides an efficient pathway for low&#8208;energy CO2 utilization and sustainable FA production.

         <title>TASK2&#8208;Inspired pH&#8208;Gating Polymeric Nanochannels with Multiple Interconvertible Permeability States by Synergistic Regulation of Conformation and Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic precise permeation regulation of biological ion channels, an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy is provided to build smart polymeric nanochannels with four ion permeability states in response to pH stimuli. Beneficial for synergy transformation of structure and charge properties, the nanochannels achieve pH&#8208;gating on&#8211;off switch of fast cation flux, superhigh cation/anion selectivity, and salinity&#8208;gradient energy transduction, respectively. 








Abstract
Biological ion channels can regulate finely the ion transmembrane permeation, with superhigh ion selectivity and on&#8211;off ion flux in response to external stimuli, for signal transduction and energy conversion. However, fabricating smart artificial nanochannels with analogous functions remain challenging by single design of structure or charge property. In vivo, function basis of pH&#8208;gated TWIK&#8208;related acid&#8208;sensitive K+ channel 2 (TASK2) channels is attributed to synergy control of geometrical conformation and surface potential for filter gates. With this inspiration, we report an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy to construct biomimetic responsive nanochannels, based on dye&#8208;loading branched poly(piperidine)s. Two nanochannel models, negatively&#8208;charged large pores (0.76&#160;nm) and positively&#8208;charged small pores (0.49&#160;nm), can be switched quickly by external pH stimuli, due to protonation/deprotonation and conformation change of gates. Thereby, symmetric and asymmetric pH stimuli at the two sides of nanochannels achieve four distinct permeability states to various ions, respectively, to mimic inactivated, inhibited, rest, and activated states of TASK2 channels. Applying for salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion, the high&#8208;selectivity/high&#8208;flux states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;3332) and low&#8208;selectivity and low&#8208;flux permeability states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;0.33) act as an on&#8211;off switch of salinity&#8208;gradient energy nanogenerator, with superhigh energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;50%. This work suggests the potential of extrinsic&#8208;gate composite nanochannels for in vitro biomimetic applications.

         <title>Precisely Bonded Fe&#9472;Cu Diatomic Sites with Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Coordination on Hollow C3N4 Spheres for Efficient C&#9472;N Coupling and Selective Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Hollow g&#8208;C3N4 spheres anchored with Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites enable efficient photocatalytic CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction via selective adsorption and synergistic C&#9472;N coupling. The Fe site activates CO2, while the Cu site stabilizes N2, facilitating *NCON intermediate formation. Atomic&#8208;level Fe&#9472;Cu coordination enhances charge separation, light harvesting, and multireactant activation for sustainable urea synthesis.








Abstract
The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner&#8208;scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe&#9472;Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N2&#9472;Fe1&#9472;Cu1&#9472;N2 /C3N4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO2 and N2, in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2, the Fe1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO2, while bonded Cu1 sites stabilize N2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C&#9472;N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40&#160;mg&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic&#8208;level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C&#9472;N coupling for value&#8208;added products using CO2 and N2 as feedstock.

Halogenation engineering of benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors enables nonhalogenated solvent processed organic solar cells with an efficiency 20.14%, revealing how halogenation modulates intermolecular interactions, energy loss, and morphology.








Abstract
Halogenation emerges as a key strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) by tuning molecular packing, energy levels, and charge dynamics. Here, we report three new benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;core small&#8208;molecule acceptors, namely NA5, NA6, and NA7, and systematically evaluate their photovoltaic properties in o&#8208;xylene&#8208;processed binary and ternary OSCs. Halogenation significantly strengthens intermolecular interactions, improves charge carrier mobility, and facilitates exciton dissociation, leading to a remarkable increase in binary device efficiencies from &#8764;2% (NA5) to over 17% (NA6, NA7). However, halogenation also increases charge&#8208;transfer state character, which can induce higher nonradiative recombination and energy loss. Despite this drawback, the enhanced driving force for charge separation and improved morphological order enabled by halogenation outweigh the negative effects on energy loss. Notably, incorporation of NA7 into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 ternary system optimizes blend morphology, suppresses nonradiative recombination, and thus achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 20.14% (certified 19.93%)&#8212;the highest reported for OSCs processed with hydrocarbon solvents. These findings highlight the dual role of halogenation in modulating both beneficial and detrimental aspects of device energetics, providing new insights into molecular design strategies for high&#8208;performance, environmental&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>Cyclometalating Ligand Affords NIR Absorption in Ruthenium Complexes for Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing a cyclometalating ligand, we report &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP, which exhibits (metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer, resulting in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region absorption. The TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;donating capacity, promotes Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT), rendering it highly effective under hypoxic conditions. This work provides design principles for cyclometalated Ru (II) complexes with NIR absorption for Type&#8208;I PDT.








Abstract
The development of NIR photosensitizers (PSs) based on Ru complexes with Type&#8208;I process holds substantial promise for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer, though this breakthrough remains unrealized to date. Herein, a pair of cyclometalated Ru enantiomers, [&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;dqpy&#8208;TPABP]Cl (dqpy: 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine; TPABP: 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)triphenylamine) (&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP), were synthesized and evaluated. These complexes exhibit strong Ru(d) and TPABP(&#960;) &#8594; dqpy(&#960;*) charge transfer ((metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer; ML&#8211;LCT) absorption at &#8764;640&#160;nm, with an extended absorption tail reaching up to 800&#160;nm. Moreover, the TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;rich capacity, contributes to T1 formation, which increases the electron transfer possibility in the triplet state and promotes Type&#8208;I PDT, making it highly effective for killing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Further encapsulating &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP into polymeric nanoparticles results in high tumor inhibition efficiency (&gt;85%) and causes a strong tumoricidal effect and inhibits lung metastasis of breast tumors under 700&#160;nm light irradiation, thus offering a new strategy for developing NIR Ru complexes for anticancer treatment through the design of cyclometalating ligand.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+2]/Cheletropic Retro&#8208;[4+1] Cycloadditions of Thiophene S,S&#8208;Dioxides with 3&#8208;Substituted Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric IEDDA/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions, using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides (TDOs) and 3&#8208;substituted indoles as reaction partners, are realized by a chiral Fe(III)/BOX complex. A series of cyclohexa&#8208;fused tricyclic indolines bearing a bridgehead quaternary stereogenic center are synthesized in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by the concise total synthesis of pentacyclic Strychnos indole alkaloid (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.








Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides are a prominent method for synthesizing unsaturated six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, to the best of our knowledge, catalytic asymmetric variations of these reactions have not yet been achieved. Herein, we report Fe(III)&#8208;bis(oxazoline) complex&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand [4+2] cycloaddition/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] extrusion of SO2 reactions between thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides and 3&#8208;substituted indoles. The key to the success of this transformation involves using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxide components bearing an N&#8208;acyloxazolidinone group at the C2 position, which coordinates with the chiral catalyst, and a halide group at the C5 position to prevent the self&#8208;dimerization of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. Computational studies revealed that the [4+2] cycloaddition proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, with the subsequent retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition acting as a driving force to facilitate the initial [4+2] cycloaddition. This [4+2]/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition reaction sequence enables the synthesis of a broad range of hexahydrocarbazoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center, which are core structures in numerous families of indole alkaloids, in good yields with high enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated through diverse product transformations and a concise, enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.

Bio&#8208;inspired proton transport regulation via 5&#8208;fluorouracil tautomerism within sulfonated MOF&#8208;808 to reconcile the inherent trade&#8208;off between low activation energy and sustained proton mobility








Abstract
The strategic modulation of proton transport kinetics and precise control of migration energy barriers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are essential for developing next&#8208;generation proton conductors. Inspired by biological proton channels, this study introduces a dynamic regulation strategy by keto&#8208;enol tautomerism to reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between low activation energy (Ea) and sustained proton mobility. We successfully construct a hierarchical proton conductive system (denoted as FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H) by integrating 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) molecules into sulfonic&#8208;functionalized MOF&#8208;808 through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. The enol tautomer of 5&#8208;FU reconfigures hydrogen&#8208;bond networks under humidity variations, synergizing with anchored &#9472;SO3H groups to establish proton transport pathways along ordered ionic channels (&#9472;SO3H&#183;&#183;&#183;H2O&#183;&#183;&#183;5&#8208;FU) and tautomerism&#8208;driven delocalization via reversible keto&#8208;enol isomerization. The optimized compound FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H exhibits a high proton conductivity of 7.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and 95% RH, representing an approximate 300&#8208;fold enhancement over pristine MOF&#8208;808, a 15&#8208;fold improvement versus the 5&#8208;FU&#8208;encapsulated analogue FU@MOF&#8208;808, and the sulfonated framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate an ultra&#8208;low formation energy barrier (9.05 and 1.59&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1) from keto to enol conversion, attributed to sulfonic acid stabilization of protonated transition states. Furthermore, the proton conductive mechanism is visually corroborated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, suggesting Grotthuss&#8208;dominated proton migration within hydrated nanochannels, aligning with experimental results.

The optimized compound &lt;b&gt;FU@MOF-808-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a high proton conductivity of 7.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 353&#160;K and 95% RH, representing an approximate 300-fold enhancement over pristine &lt;b&gt;MOF-808&lt;/b&gt;, a 15-fold improvement versus the 5-FU-encapsulated analogue &lt;b&gt;FU@MOF-808&lt;/b&gt;, and the sulfonated framework &lt;b&gt;MOF-808-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate an ultra-low formation energy barrier (9.05 and 1.59&#160;kcal&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) from keto to enol conversion, attributed to sulfonic acid stabilization of protonated transition states. Furthermore, the proton conductive mechanism is visually corroborated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, suggesting Grotthuss-dominated proton migration within hydrated nanochannels, aligning with experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adjusting Chemical Hardness&#8211;Softness Balance of Electrolyte to Enable High&#8208;Voltage Reversible Fluoride Ion Batteries</title>

An electrolyte system based on tetrabutylammonium fluoride salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid solvent is designed based on anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base balance modulation. The soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively expanding the electrochemical window and cycling life of fluoride ion batteries based on Cu2O cathode.








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs), as a promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage technology, have attracted significant attention. However, developing an ideal fluoride&#8208;ion electrolyte that suppresses the &#946;&#8208;H abstraction (caused by strong Lewis&#8208;basicity F&#8722;) and electrolyte decomposition remains challenging. To address this bottleneck, we design an electrolyte system based on commercial tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4) ionic liquid solvent through anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base (HSAB) balance modulation, unveiling its multiscale mechanisms for mitigating interfacial parasitic reaction and enhancing metal anode stability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively blocking the &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway and expanding the electrochemical window to 4.5&#160;V. The ionic conductivity of this ionic liquid based electrolyte reaches 5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C even after in situ polymerization. The Cu2O cathode coupling insertion and conversion reactions can alleviate the volume deformation and capacity decay of Cu2O||Li&#8211;LiF high&#8208;voltage FIBs, with a high resting voltage (2.91&#160;V) and a high initial capacity of 589.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1. The Cu2O||Pb&#8211;PbF2 FIBs maintain a high reversible capacity of 243.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 even after 800 cycles under 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The work establishes a novel electrolyte design paradigm for high&#8208;voltage reversible FIBs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Silacyclization by Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Selective C&#9472;F or C&#9472;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;dependent, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes is developed to enable the efficient construction of six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. Selective C&#8211;F functionalization is achieved under 456&#160;nm LED irradiation, while irradiation at 335&#160;nm promotes acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization via C&#8211;H functionalization.








Abstract
Silacycles have gained significant attention within the synthetic community due to their pivotal roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Despite recent advancements, the defluorosilylation of aryl fluorides with hydrosilanes and the selective silylation of arenes without external oxidants remains challenging. Herein, we present a wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;mediated cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes to efficiently construct six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. By employing a synergistic system of an organophotocatalyst and a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, our approach exploits specific light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) wavelengths (456 and 335&#160;nm) to achieve selective C&#8211;F and C&#8211;H functionalization. This wavelength modulation enables the first successful defluorosilacyclization of ortho&#8208;fluoroallylbenzenes and facilitates an acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization, demonstrating precise site&#8208;selective functionalization. Mechanistic investigations reveal a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;facilitated intermolecular hydrosilylation followed by a wavelength&#8208;dependent, chemoselective intramolecular silacyclization cascade. Additionally, an unprecedented light&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution process involving silane and thiol is uncovered within the cascade C&#8211;H silacyclization. This photo&#8208;mediated strategy offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the synthesis of valuable silacycle compounds, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and precise wavelength&#8208;dependent chemoselectivity.

The rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex achieves near&#8208;unity PLQY by suppressing nonradiative losses via &#960;&#8208;conjugations. Its flexible scintillator film enables a high&#8208;resolution (&gt;20 lp mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging, a low radiation dose (71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1), and detailed 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction, demonstrating great potential for computed tomography (CT) applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors are essential for 3D X&#8208;ray imaging in computed tomography (CT), but conventional systems require high radiation doses to achieve fine resolution. All&#8208;In&#8208;One (AIO) Cu(I) halide complexes, capable of forming both ionic and coordinate bonds within a single structure, offer efficient scintillation at lower doses, yet their performance remains limited by nonradiative energy losses during indirect X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion. Here, we develop rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted AIO Cu(I) halide complexes by introducing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to suppress the nonradiative pathways, achieving near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). In particular, the rigid (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex stabilizes triplet emissive states, thereby facilitating high&#8208;efficiency radiative recombination and excellent radioluminescence (RL) properties. When incorporated into flexible scintillator film, Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 demonstrates remarkable X&#8208;ray imaging performance, enabling a high spatial resolution exceeding 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and a low radiation dose of 71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1. Importantly, 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction of small electronic components reveals fine structural details, highlighting the potential of Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 as a next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray scintillator for low&#8208;dose CT imaging.

         <title>Chemically Stable Tetrazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages with Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification via Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions for SF6/N2 and CO2/N2 Separation</title>

A rigid tetrazine&#8208;based porous organic cage with record SF6 uptake is post&#8208;synthetically tuned via iEDDA chemistry to enhance stability, and further polymerized into networked materials with tunable porosity for selective CO2/N2 separation.








Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) have emerged as promising porous materials for a wide range of applications. However, their development is often limited by insufficient chemical stability and challenges in systematically functionalization. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a tetrazine&#8208;based POC (TC1) featuring rigid tetrahedral structure, prepared via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. TC1 exhibits high porosity, with a BET surface area at 1157&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1, and good chemically stability, surpassing most POCs formed through dynamic covalent chemistry. Its well&#8208;defined, electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity enable efficient SF6/N2 separation, showing the highest SF6 adsorption capacity and selectivity among all reported porous molecular materials to data, as confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Post&#8208;synthetic modification of TC1 via inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions yielded two functionalized cages (TC2 and TC3), which maintain good porosity and display further enhanced chemical stability over a broad pH range (&#8208;1 to 15). Furthermore, cage&#8208;based networked materials (TC1&#8208;P1 and TC1&#8208;P2) were successfully constructed through the iEDDA polymerization using TC1 as building unit, resulting in tunable porous frameworks with improved CO2/N2 selectivity.

         <title>Toward Bimetallic Nanowire Arrays with Controlled Compositions Using Block Copolymer Films: The Interplay Between Metal Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;impregnation of block copolymer films enables the creation of ordered arrays of bimetallic nanowires (NWs). The dependence of the NW composition on the feed revealed direct and indirect modes of mutual influence between the metal precursors stemming from the types of interactions involved. The insights gained now enable to design and fabricate arrays of multimetallic nanostructures with both complex morphologies and controlled compositions.








Abstract
Metallic nanowire (NW) arrays are promising components for nanotechnology owing to their elongated, continuous, and directional structure. Bimetallic NWs present synergistic effects that are advantageous for applications in catalysis and magnetism. Yet, creating bimetallic NW arrays requires concomitant control over composition and organization. Block copolymer films, which exhibit periodic arrays of nano&#8208;domains, provide templates that satisfy this requirement. Impregnating the film using two metal precursors followed by plasma treatment enabled us to prepare NW arrays with different bimetallic compositions. The NW composition was found to depend on the composition of the impregnation solution in a nontrivial way, which was strongly influenced by the type of metals used. Studying the behavior of three model metal pairs unraveled different characteristic co&#8208;impregnation behaviors, which we could associate with metal&#8208;ligand and metal&#8208;metal interactions. The insights gained in this study allow us to create bimetallic NW arrays with compositions tailored to the desired properties.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Engineered Anion Regulation Enables Fast&#8208;Charging Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;engineered ZIF&#8208;8 separators with preferential (110) exposure enable directional Li+ flux by anchoring TFSI&#8722; anions at unsaturated Zn sites, suppressing lithium dendrite growth and stabilizing the interface. The microporous architecture further regulates lithium plating, supporting high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle lithium metal batteries under practical conditions.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) offer exceptional energy density and output voltage. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish ion transport and uncontrolled lithium dendrite formation, particularly under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, we report a facet&#8208;engineered anion&#8208;regulating separator based on zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with preferentially crystal&#8208;exposed (110) facets. The coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers on this surface serve as Lewis acid sites that selectively anchor bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions (TFSI&#8722;), inducing directional Li+ flux and suppressing dendritic growth. Concurrently, the microporous framework facilitates spatial lithium confinement, mitigating local current density and enhancing interfacial stability. As a result, the engineered separator enables ultra&#8208;stable cycling of Li||Cu cells for over 1400 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.7%. In full&#8208;cell configurations, LiFePO4 (LFP) cells exhibit 99.9% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles at 5 C, while high&#8208;loading Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 12.30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cell retains 84.4% of its capacity after 135 cycles. Furthermore, a Li||LFP pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 19.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 demonstrates robust cycling over 170 cycles. These findings establish facet&#8208;engineered separators based on framework materials as a versatile and scalable strategy for advancing stable and fast&#8208;charging metal batteries.

         <title>Mechanistic Divergence in Sulfur&#8208;Ligated Iron(III)&#8208;Alkylperoxo Reactivity: Aldehyde Oxidation Prevails over Deformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

This study explores the mechanistic investigation into an unusual reactivity of a thioether&#8208;ligated low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;alkylperoxide with cyclohexane&#8211;carboxaldehyde as a mimic of nonheme iron(II) enzyme intermediates and highlights that only efficient catalysis happens from a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.








Abstract
Metalloenzymes activate molecular oxygen within their catalytic cycles to generate a reactive species capable of substrate transformation. In many iron&#8208;containing enzymes, it is a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex that is synthesized from an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, although direct observation and characterization of such species have remained elusive, leaving their mechanistic role uncertain. To address this gap in our understanding, we present here the synthesis, comprehensive characterization, and reactivity of a novel thioether&#8208;ligated iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo complex supported by the ligand 2&#8208;((2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl)thio)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine. Characterization was done using UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Reactivity studies reveal that this complex exhibits electrophilic oxidation of model substrates, including dimethylsulfide, triphenylphosphine, and cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde. Notably, the latter substrate reacts via the unusual aldehyde C&#9472;H bond abstraction leading to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, which is explained by favorable aldehyde C&#9472;H abstraction transition states due to stabilizing interactions between the ligand framework and the substrate. Moreover, the reaction is initiated with a homolytic O&#9472;O bond cleavage in the iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo group that yields a reactive iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species that mediates substrate oxidation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a mononuclear low&#8208;spin (S = &#189;) nonheme iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo complex displaying such unprecedented electrophilic reactivity.

         <title>Regiodivergent Ligand&#8208;Controlled Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydroxymethylation of Alkynes with Aqueous Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent water&#8208;tolerant reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has been developed via synergistic visible light organophotoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. The reaction produced valuable linear and branched allylic alcohols with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by choosing of suitable ligand under otherwise the same reaction conditions.








Abstract
Allylic alcohols are versatile and essential building blocks in synthetic chemistry, widely used for the preparation of complex molecules, pharmaceuticals, and materials. We report here a regiodivergent reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde to prepare allylic alcohols enabled by visible light photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. Using readily available, bulk, and cheap aqueous formaldehyde as a simple C1 source, this method allows for the selective production of both linear and branched allylic alcohols in one&#8208;step manner. The excellent regioselectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled by adjusting the electronic and steric properties of the ligands. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by careful selection of ligands. Mechanistic studies reveal a pathway involving ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and formaldehyde, followed by a protonolysis process, offering new insights into the catalyst design and reaction mechanism.

         <title>Sustained, Reversible, and Adaptive Non&#8208;Equilibrium Steady States of a Dissipative DNA&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous supply of an RNA chemical fuel allows sustained non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction to be achieved. The system can dynamically adapt in real&#8208;time to subtle on&#8208;the&#8208;fly variations of fuel supply, demonstrating remarkable control over a dissipative process, which is unachievable when using batch&#8208;wise fuel additions. We confirmed the non&#8208;equilibrium composition of the system at the NESS.








Abstract
Inspired by nature, researchers have developed several chemical fuel&#8208;driven supramolecular systems aimed at achieving improved kinetic control over their formation and functions. Alongside, DNA&#8208;based systems regulated by energy&#8208;dissipating mechanisms have been reported. However, the majority of these systems rely on batchwise additions of chemical fuels to closed reactors, resulting in transient non&#8208;equilibrium states that differ fundamentally from the sustained and highly adaptable non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) maintained by living systems through continuous energy dissipation. Here, we demonstrate sustained NESS of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction achieved through the continuous supply of an RNA fuel to an open semi&#8208;batch reactor, using a custom automated setup that enables tunable fuel infusion rates and in situ analysis. Similar to biological NESS, our system dynamically adapts in real&#8208;time to subtle variations in fuel supply, achieving different steady&#8208;state levels of the strand&#8208;displacement reaction. Our approach demonstrates remarkable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly control over a dissipative DNA nanosystem, unachievable when working under batch conditions. Importantly, by fitting the experimental data to a kinetic model of the reaction network, we were able to confirm that the observed steady states correspond to true non&#8208;equilibrium compositions of the system.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Metal Interaction in Cu&#8208;In Single Atom Alloy Switching Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;In single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, Cu99In1 and Cu1In99, were constructed by reversing the host and guest metals, resulting in a switch in the CO2 electroreduction reaction pathway from favoring CO to HCOOH. In both SAA catalysts, Cu serves as the active site, with its adsorption energy modulated by surrounding Indium atoms, enabling high selectivity for a single product.








Abstract
The catalytic behavior of alloy electrocatalyst is strongly influenced by host&#8211;guest metal interaction, which governs adsorption energy and product selectivity. However, in conventional bimetallic alloy systems, the catalyst composition and the geometric configuration often obscure the identification of critical active sites. Here, we investigate the host&#8211;guest metal interaction in Cu&#8211;In single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, demonstrating a remarkable switching of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) pathway. Doping 1% Indium into a Cu matrix forms isolated In&#8208;Cu interfaces, enabling efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%. Conversely, doping 1% Cu into an Indium matrix leads to the formation of a CuIn alloy phase, shifting the product selectivity to HCOOH with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%. In situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that Cu serves as the active site on both Cu&#8211;In SAA catalysts. The adsorption energy of host Cu atoms is affected by doped Indium at the In&#8208;Cu interface, which promotes CO2 adsorption and activation while weakening the binding strength of linearly bonded *CO, thereby enhancing CO selectivity. Conversely, the rigid matrix of the CuIn alloy stabilizes the bridge&#8208;bonded *CO, favoring the production of HCOOH.

         <title>A Universal Voltage&#8208;Enhancement Strategy Based on Multifunctional Ligand&#8208;Mediated Modulation for Na&#8208;Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ antibonding orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3&#8314;/Mn&#8308;&#8314; redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising energy storage solutions due to resource abundance and low cost, yet their practical deployment is hindered by limited operating voltages of cathode materials. Herein, we propose a universal ligand&#8208;field engineering strategy to enhance voltage through electronic structure modulation in transition metal oxides. Using the Na0.67Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 as a model system, weak&#8208;field ligands are introduced to alter the coordination environment of MnO6 octahedra. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V. Concurrently, the lowered initial Mn oxidation state induces an increased discharge capacity by 35.7% (153.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), while suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions and Mn3+ disproportionation yielding 94.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles (versus 69.9% in pristine sample). This ligand&#8208;engineering strategy in regulating redox voltage can be extended to other systems with eg&#8727;$e_g^*$&#8208;involved redox systems (such as Ni&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and Mn&#8208;based cathodes). Our work establishes a direct correlation between eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital energy modulation and operating voltage, providing foundational insights for designing Na&#8208;layered oxide cathodes with high operating voltage.

         <title>A New Phase Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) Activated Selective CO2 Reduction into Formate for Underwater Antifouling Glass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D new&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: trigonal phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) was reported to achieve formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% and remained stable for more than 30&#160;h, exhibiting excellent antifouling behavior toward a new application in underwater antifouling windows. 








Abstract
Designing unique electrocatalysts that utilizes carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) for real applications is highly appreciated, yet still suffers from low selectivity, stability, and compatibility. Herein, we first report a new two&#8208;dimensional metastable&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: 1T phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) with the space group of P&#8722;3m1 (164), which is totally different from that of the stable cubic phase ITO (Ia&#8722;3 (206)). The internal indium tin catalytic pairs in m&#8208;ITOs trigger the strong electronic coupling, move up the p&#8208;band center, and stabilize the adsorption of HCOO* for increased formate production. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit a high CO2RR electrocatalytic performance with the formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% (83&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6% for In2O3/SnO2) and remains 97% (58% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 60% for In2O3/SnO2) of catalytic activity after a 120,000&#160;s stability test. Owing to the efficient formate formation with directly using the absorbed CO2 in water and high transparent property, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit excellent antifouling behavior of inhibiting Chlorella growth without reducing the transparency of itself, encouraging a promising application of observation windows in water.

&lt;p&gt;A 2D new-phase transparent conducting oxide: trigonal phase indium tin oxide (m-ITOs) was reported to achieve formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% and remained stable for more than 30&#160;h, exhibiting excellent antifouling behavior toward a new application in underwater antifouling windows. 

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing unique electrocatalysts that utilizes carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) for real applications is highly appreciated, yet still suffers from low selectivity, stability, and compatibility. Herein, we first report a new two-dimensional metastable-phase transparent conducting oxide: 1T phase indium tin oxide (m-ITOs) with the space group of P&#8722;3m1 (164), which is totally different from that of the stable cubic phase ITO (Ia&#8722;3 (206)). The internal indium tin catalytic pairs in m-ITOs trigger the strong electronic coupling, move up the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-band center, and stabilize the adsorption of HCOO* for increased formate production. In a liquid-phase flow cell, m-ITOs exhibit a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalytic performance with the formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% (83&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1% for c-SnInO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and 74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6% for In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and remains 97% (58% for c-SnInO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and 60% for In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of catalytic activity after a 120,000&#160;s stability test. Owing to the efficient formate formation with directly using the absorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water and high transparent property, m-ITOs exhibit excellent antifouling behavior of inhibiting &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; growth without reducing the transparency of itself, encouraging a promising application of observation windows in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Assay System to Quantify O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) Activity in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded, imaging&#8208;based reporter enables direct measurement of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity in living cells. The system exploits OGT&#8208;dependent proteolysis of HCF&#8208;1 to drive nuclear and cytoplasmic redistribution of fluorescent signals, allowing cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell spatially resolved quantification of OGT activity. This OGT&#8208;CAR platform offers a powerful tool for studying OGT regulation and discovering cellular modulators.








Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins and plays important roles in regulating diverse cellular functions. Dysregulation of OGT is implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegeneration. Despite its vital roles, little is known about how this enzyme is regulated within cells in part because no current assays directly report on its activity within cells. Here we describe a genetically encoded reporter of cellular OGT glycosyltransferase activity by exploiting the transferase&#8208;dependent proteolytic activity of OGT on host cell factor&#8208;1 (HCF&#8208;1). The reporter comprises sites at which OGT cleaves HCF&#8208;1, which are flanked by two different fluorescent proteins that are linked to either nuclear export or import sequences. OGT&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of this construct leads to separation and independent localization of these two fluorescent proteins. By quantifying their nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions, OGT activity can be measured. We validated this OGT cellular activity reporter (CAR) system using known modulators of the O&#8208;GlcNAc pathway and assessed the effects of several metabolites on OGT activity. Analyses of the dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent effects of these OGT modulators illustrate the sensitivity and precision of this OGT&#8208;CAR strategy. We envision this OGT&#8208;CAR system will aid in discovering and characterizing modifiers of OGT activity.

         <title>Enhancement of Emission Efficiency and Color Tuning by Mixing Platinum(II) and Palladium(II) Complexes in a One&#8208;dimensional Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing isomorphous Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes, which have very low emission efficiencies at room temperature, in pure crystals, a series of mixed crystals with high emission efficiencies and luminescent colors depending on the mixing ratio were successfully constructed. The characteristic luminescence of the mixed crystals originates from excited oligomers with different Pt/Pd ratios.








Abstract
A series of mixed metal crystals comprising square&#8208;planar platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes, K[M(CN)2(dFppy)]&#183;H2O (M&#160;=&#160;Pt2+, Pd2+; dFppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridinate), were prepared, and their unique luminescence properties&#8212;emerging upon mixing&#8212;were revealed. Seven mixed crystals with Pt/Pd ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4.5, 1:10, and 1:13 adopt the same crystal structure (P21/c) as the pure metal complexes, in which the metal complexes are stacked with short M&#8943;M contacts (3.35&#8211;3.37&#160;&#197; at 293&#160;K). Reflecting the M&#8943;M interactions, the mixed crystals exhibited luminescence attributable to the emission from the triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) state. The emission color varied with the Pt/Pd mixing ratio, and notably, a significant enhancement in emission quantum yield was observed (e.g., &#934;&#160;=&#160;0.64 for the Pt/Pd&#160;=&#160;1:2 crystal at room temperature). The emission efficiency further improved at temperatures above room temperature. These unprecedented emission properties are explained by energy transfer among multiple emission sites within the one&#8208;dimensional chain, involving excited oligomers containing various combinations of Pt and Pd complexes. Thus, metal mixing offers a new strategy for enhancing emission efficiency and enabling color tuning.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable and Tunable Polyolefin&#8208;Like Multiblock Copolymer Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock copolymer adhesives with tunable cohesion and adhesion. By controlling crystallinity, ester content, and block structure, these materials achieve up to &#8764;80% stronger adhesion than EVA, while enabling depolymerization, reuse, and multilayer deconstruction&#8212;offering a sustainable and high&#8208;performance HMA platform.








Abstract
Adhesives are important in creating multilayer products, such as in packaging and construction. Most current hot&#8208;melt adhesives such as poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) (EVA) and polyurethanes lack chemical recyclability and do not easily de&#8208;bond, complicating recycling. Here, we achieved tunable adhesive properties of chemically recyclable polyolefin&#8208;like multiblock copolymers through regulating the incorporation of crystalline hard blocks, amorphous soft blocks, and ester content highlighted by adhesive strengths up to 6.80&#160;MPa. We further demonstrated applications of these adhesives in multi&#8208;layer films and showed that the adhesives can be readily de&#8208;bonded, recovered, and chemically recycled. Overall, this study into structure&#8211;property relationships, including effects of crystallinity, soft&#8208;block incorporation, and ester content of the multiblock copolymers on adhesive properties, has resulted in a modular hot&#8208;melt adhesive platform that exhibits chemical recyclability for virgin&#8208;quality adhesive re&#8208;generation, reprocessability for repeated reuse of the recovered adhesive, and tunability for designing adhesives with a wide range of low to high (up to &#8764;80% stronger than EVA) adhesion strengths.

         <title>Fluorine Modified Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Enables Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries by Suppression of Polyiodide Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexapod&#8208;shaped fluorine&#8208;modified zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) particles are synthesized as a functional layer on the glass fiber separator to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have emerged as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high specific capacity. However, their commercial implementation is severely hindered by the irreversible capacity degradation and limited cycle life, which are caused by the unavoidable iodine shuttle effect resulting from the formation of soluble I3&#8722; species. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional hexapod&#8208;like fluorine&#8208;containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (H&#8208;F&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles for separator modification to effectively inhibit the iodine shuttle effect. The modified layer can interact with the I3&#8722; species at the cathode&#8211;separator interface where the iodine shuttle occurs. Furthermore, the fluorine&#8208;containing functional group (&#9472;CF3) serves as an electron acceptor, enhancing the electrostatic interaction with I3&#8722; species, and thereby improving the polyiodide capture capacity. As a result, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery using H&#8208;F&#8208;ZIF modified separator exhibits excellent cycling durability and high capacity, retaining a capacity of 155.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 12&#160;000 cycles at 1.2&#160;A g&#8722;1, and a coulombic efficiency of 86.4% after 48&#160;h of resting.

         <title>Engineering Covalent and Noncovalent Interface Synergy in MXenes for Ultralong&#8208;life and Efficient Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the ANF&#8208;mediated thermal reconstruction, we achieved the deep modification of MXene with synergistic noncovalent/covalent interaction toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off between the reactivity and stability for energetic pseudocapacitive storage chemistry. The unique synergistic interface effects trigger a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180, 000 cycles.








Abstract
MXenes serve as pivotal candidates for pseudocapacitive energy storage owing to sound proton/electron&#8208;transport capability and tunable topology. However, the metastable surface terminal properties and the progressive oxidation leads to drastic capacity fading, posing significant challenges for sustainable energy applications. Here, with the aramid nanofiber as the interface mediator, we engineer the thermal reconstruction of MXenes to synergistically introduce interfacial covalent and noncovalent interactions, resulting in a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180,&#160;000 cycles. In&#8208;situ heating transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrate the formation of ultrafine mesopores with interfacial reconstitution for mass transport intensification. Theoretical calculations indicate electronic accumulation adjacent to the covalent bonds, endowing the heterogeneous interface with fast electronic conduction capability and favorable adsorption of H+. In addition, the dual modification improves the oxidation energy barrier of MXenes to TiO2, resulting in a thermodynamically promoted and sustainable storage microenvironment. Our research emphasizes the synergistic mechanism of noncovalent interactions and covalent bonding toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off of MXenes between the reactivity and stability for energetic energy storage.

         <title>CO2 Versus CH4 Aggregation on Trifluorobenzene: Molecular Level Characterization via Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
What makes aromatic ligands selective for CO2 over CH4? Broadband rotational spectroscopy reveals how 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene forms stronger F&#8943;C tetrel and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with CO2, versus weaker CH&#8943;F hydrogen bonds with CH4, along with intriguing tunneling motions. These molecular&#8208;level insights could benefit the design of ligands for selective gas adsorption in MOFs and related materials.








Abstract
The cluster growth behavior of CO2 and CH4 on an aromatic ligand has been studied through the unambiguous identification of complex structures of 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene&#8208;(CO2)1&#8211;4 and &#8208;&#223;(CH4)1&#8211;2 using broadband rotational spectroscopy in conjunction with extensive theoretical calculations. The results reveal a contrast in the thermodynamically favorable ligand&#8208;gas binding sites and noncovalent interactions of the two gaseous molecules on the ligand. The observation of a tunneling splitting and large centrifugal distortions indicates that CH4 molecules bind to the fluorinated &#960; system via three weak hydrogen bonds without CH4 self&#8208;interactions, resulting in an effective structure displaced toward the dissociation limit. Conversely, CO2 shows diverse and stronger intermolecular interactions with the fluorinated benzene, including F&#9472;C tetrel bonding, lone pair to &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and a significant contribution from CO2 self&#8208;interactions. The thorough examination of ligand&#8211;gas interactions and aggregation patterns highlights the significant capacity and selectivity of the fluorinated aromatic ligand for accepting CO2 over CH4.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the Ru 4d and the C&#8801;N 2p induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and further modulates the d&#8208;electron structure of V/Fe, enabling the cooperative V3+/V4+, Ru(2x&#8208;&#948;)+/Ru2x+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ multi&#8208;redox reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage offers grid&#8208;scale energy storage system with long lifespan, great safety, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, preparing proton storage materials with balanced conductivity, activity, and stability remains challenging due to suboptimal structure design. Herein, we report atomic&#8208;level engineering of d&#8208;p orbital hybridization strategy to regulate transition metal (V/Fe) d&#8208;band centers. Vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF)/RuOx quantum dots (RuOxQDs) heterostructure (VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs) was synthesized via in situ co&#8208;precipitation. The d&#8208;p hybridization of Ru's 4d orbital with VHCF's C&#8801;N 2p orbital (cyano) induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and creates &#8220;electronic highways&#8221; for regulating the d&#8208;electrons of V/Fe, shifting their d&#8208;band centers to achieve continuous multi&#8208;electron transfer. Moreover, optimizing the d&#8208;electron structure reduces the V5+ ratio and thus decreases vanadium dissolution during cycling. The VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs cathode delivers a large capacity of 162&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability (127&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 40&#160;A g&#8722;1), and ultralong stability over 10&#160;000 cycles. When paired with MoO3&#8211;MXene anode, the asymmetric full device achieves a high energy density of 53&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1.3&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. The atomic&#8208;level orbital hybridization regulation of d&#8208;electron structure provides a new direction for high&#8208;performance proton storage.

A light&#8208;induced transfection system (LITS) was designed to precisely control the delivery of mRNA, achieving spatiotemporal de&#8208;coupling of the pleotropic inflammatory and tolerogenic signals of interleukin&#8208;2 to conduct safe eradication of tumors.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of protein expression remains a critical challenge in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics, particularly for tumor&#8208;targeted therapy. Here, we introduce a Light&#8208;Induced Transfection System (LITS) leveraging photosensitizing polymers to deliver mRNA systemically and activate its translation via light&#8208;triggered endosomal escape. This system enables localized protein expression in any irradiated tissue, allowing for spatial control of therapeutic effects. Using interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) as a model, we demonstrate that LITS can trigger proinflammatory cytokine levels in irradiated tumors, while inducing tolerogenic IL&#8208;2 levels in nonirradiated healthy tissues. This modulation of IL&#8208;2&#8242;s pleiotropic effects provides both potent antitumor activity and reduced toxicity. Furthermore, by optimizing light exposure, LITS synergizes IL&#8208;2 efficacy by driving immunogenic cell death to eradicate lung metastasis in a breast cancer model. Our findings establish LITS as a programmable mRNA delivery platform for on&#8208;demand targeted and safe therapies.

         <title>Discrete Actuation of Water&#8208;Responsive Crystalline Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design metal&#8211;peptide frameworks that exhibit either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;responsive actuation by tuning water&#8208;binding affinities and structural dynamics. In the continuous actuation mode, water molecules evaporate sequentially due to varying interaction strengths and structural roles. Conversely, when water molecules display comparable interactions and roles, they release simultaneously during dehydration, producing discrete threshold actuation.








Abstract
Engineering guest&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled and precise sorption behavior and structural deformation in response to external stimuli is imperative for various applications. However, existing systems often exhibit complex, unpredictable dynamics, posing challenges for efficient control and utilization. Here, we design crystalline metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with tunable water&#8208;responsive (WR) dynamics by assembling glycine&#8208;threonine (Gly&#8208;Thr, GT) or glycine&#8208;serine (Gly&#8208;Ser, GS) peptides with zinc (Zn) ions, achieving either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;sorption&#8208;dependent phase transitions. As ambient relative humidity (RH) changes, the Zn&#8208;GT crystal continuously adsorbs or desorbs water, resulting in gradual structural adaptations, similar to those observed in other supramolecular systems. In contrast, the Zn&#8208;GS crystal undergoes stepwise water sorption and structural transitions at specific RH thresholds. These contrasting WR modes arise from differences in water binding and structural dynamics; in Zn&#8208;GT, each coordinating water molecule contributes varying degrees of framework integrity and evaporates sequentially, whereas in Zn&#8208;GS, water molecules with comparable interactions within a flexible framework are released simultaneously during dehydration. Our study demonstrates the mechanism by which host&#8211;guest interactions can be harnessed to control dynamic sorption and actuation behavior of supramolecular materials at the molecular level, offering mechanistic insights that may guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation programmable, stimulus&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Orthogonal Control of Lattice Oxygen Activation and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Suppression via &#8220;Molecular Gates&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency Nitrile Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the principle of biological compartmentalization, Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), a dual&#8208;group molecule with phosphine oxide and alkylamine groups, is introduced as &#8220;molecular gates&#8221; to achieve orthogonal control over lattice oxygen activation and oxygen evolution reaction suppression, and the high&#8208;current nitrile electrosynthesis with unprecedented efficiency and stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
A fundamental barrier to industrial electrosynthesis is the inescapable trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity at high current densities, where parasitic reactions overwhelm the desired interfacial chemistry. Here, we introduce a bioinspired interfacial decoupling strategy using hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) to resolve this challenge for nitrile electrosysthesis. The activation of lattice oxygen for substrate dehydrogenation via metal&#8208;ligand charge redistribution, and the suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrostatic shielding by hydrophobic alkyl chains are concurrently controlled. As a result, we achieved simultaneously high activity (1.37&#160;V @300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), near&#8208;unity selectivity (93.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE)), and pharmaceutical&#8208;grade purity for propionitrile production. Further reinforced by exceptional stability (&gt;300&#160;h at industrially relevant current densities), a record production rate (143.86&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1), and &#8764;30% energy reduction, the system significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Furthermore, this electrolyte&#8208;catalyst co&#8208;optimization strategy proves universal across primary/secondary amines, offering a blueprint for sustainable chemical manufacturing beyond fossil&#8208;fueled processes.

         <title>A Transient Phenolate Enables Relaxation of Z&#8208;Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene to the Stable State in Seconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of a tetrafluoroazobenzene subunit in a spiropyran hybrid is controlled by the rate of merocyanine formation. Rate accelerations of 102&#8211;106 were observed for changes in solvent polarity, UV light irradiation and passage through silica. Rapid azobenzene isomerization occurs via a transient phenolate formed upon spiropyran ring&#8208;opening.








Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzenes (TFAs) exhibit several unique properties, including a large separation in the n&#8594;&#960;* absorption bands, which allows for efficient photoisomerization using green light, and exceptional thermal stability of their metastable Z&#8208;isomer. These features make them attractive for light&#8208;responsive applications, but controlling the thermal Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization has remained a challenge. In this work, we present a hybrid molecular system that couples a TFA subunit with a spiropyran photoswitch. The TFA subunit retains its ability to undergo selective photoisomerization with green light. Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization in the hybrid occurs approximately 1000 times faster than in a TFA model compound. This acceleration arises from a rate&#8208;determining step involving the formation of merocyanine&#8212;the ring&#8208;opened form of spiropyran. The transient phenolate form of merocyanine promotes rapid Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of the TFA, consistent with the known behavior of azobenzene phenolates. The thermodynamics of TFA isomerization are coupled with those of the spiropyran ring&#8208;opening, allowing the isomerization process to be regulated by external stimuli that influence the spiropyran&#8211;merocyanine equilibrium. In addition to observing a 100&#8211;1000&#8208;fold solvent&#8208;dependent rate increase, we demonstrate a 106&#8208;fold acceleration in TFA isomerization via either photochromism or adsorptiochromism.

         <title>Origin and Suppression of Intragranular Cracks for Long&#8208;Cycling High&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;Free Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are found to be widely distributed in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free (NM) cathodes, and the relation between APBs gain boundaries and intragranular cracks has been established for the first time. Additionally, a charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy is proposed to reduce the formation of APBs and optimize the generation/distribution of internal stresses, thereby suppressing intragranular cracks. 








Abstract
Intragranular cracks have been identified as a direct reflection of failure in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes, especially for high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes with severe electrochemical&#8211;mechanical degradation. Here we show that antiphase boundaries (APBs) are prone to form in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes and demonstrate their crucial role in determining the formation of intragranular cracks. The results show that the APBs grain boundaries are continuously expand during the electrochemical process, and their presence promotes the formation and accumulation of heterogeneous internal stresses within the layered structure, which in turn facilitates the nucleation and expansion of intragranular cracks. We further show that an elaborate charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy can inhibit APBs, which not only maintains the electronic equilibrium of the oxygen framework, but also the synergistic effect of double&#8208;site modification can exhibit a &#8220;lattice&#8208;locking&#8221; effect, leading to an ordered layered structure. The present work suppresses intragranular cracks by eliminating APBs grain boundaries, and this understanding provides insights for developing long&#8208;cycling high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes.

     alt="Origin and Suppression of Intragranular Cracks for Long-Cycling High-Ni Co-Free Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are found to be widely distributed in high-Ni Co-free (NM) cathodes, and the relation between APBs gain boundaries and intragranular cracks has been established for the first time. Additionally, a charge self-balancing doping strategy is proposed to reduce the formation of APBs and optimize the generation/distribution of internal stresses, thereby suppressing intragranular cracks.

         <title>Selectively Modulating the Donor and Acceptor Aggregation Behaviors Through Solid Additive Isomerization Engineering for Organic Solar Cells Exceeding 20% Efficiency</title>

Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation in organic solar cells. Systematic analysis demonstrates that the isomerization of solid additives can selectively modulate the aggregation behavior of donor and acceptor materials. Consequently, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far.








Abstract
Regulating the film morphology is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Given the distinct features of donor and acceptor materials, designing solid additives to selectively control the aggregation behaviors of them represents a key strategy for further development of OSCs. Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation. Systematic analysis reveals that the addition of 2,2&#8208;TT significantly enhances the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of L8&#8208;BO, yet exerts a relatively limited effect on PM6 aggregation. Conversely, the incorporation of 3,3&#8208;TT not only facilitates the formation of compact and highly ordered molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO but also substantially promote the denser &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of PM6. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs with 3,3&#8208;TT treatment achieve a higher efficiency of 19.34%, benefitting from the balanced charge mobility and longer carrier lifetime. More impressively, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far. This work highlights the critical role of the solid additive isomerization strategy in selectively regulating the aggregation characteristics of donor and acceptor materials, thereby facilitating the further advancement of OSCs field.

         <title>In Situ Exfoliation of Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three silver cyclic trinuclear units (Ag&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) are prepared and they can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen. Notably, as the reaction proceeded, in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic performance for H2O2 production.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets exhibit largely enhanced photocatalytic activities for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Conventionally, the nanosheets are fabricated through ex situ approaches (i.e., top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up) prior to catalytic applications. However, the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets via in situ exfoliation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of three 2D silver cyclic trinuclear unit (Ag&#8208;CTU)&#8208;based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs). Owing to their excellent light adsorption ability and suitable bandgap, these CMOFs can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen. Notably, the H2O2 production rates of these CMOFs were increased continuously during the photocatalytic processes, reaching 0.50, 1.40, 2.88, and 3.60&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after 6, 18, 36, and 72&#160;h, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets (&#8764;0.87&#160;nm) significantly enhances their photocatalytic activity. Moreover, these CMOFs achieve a remarkable H2O2 accumulation of 609&#160;mM over 72 h, to best of our knowledge, which surpasses the most previously reported values.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of Aryl Bromides at Palladium(I) to form Palladium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a detailed mechanistic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a Pd(I) center to generate an isolable Pd(III) species. UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow kinetic studies, including Eyring and Hammett analyses, reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a Pd(I) center, and a zero&#8208;order dependence on the substrate.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first systematic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a PdI center to generate organometallic PdIII complexes. These isolable PdIII complexes stabilized by tetradentate macrocyclic pyridinophane ligands exhibit distinct UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopic signatures that allowed for the monitoring of their generation in situ. These ligand scaffolds were sterically and electronically tuned using a modular synthetic approach to probe the kinetic properties and activation parameters of the oxidative addition reaction, and a combination of UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow spectroscopic studies reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a PdI center. In addition, these results are in strong agreement with our recent reactivity studies, which demonstrated that mononuclear PdI systems are competent catalysts in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and thus set the stage for an improved understanding of potential catalytic applications for odd&#8208;electron Pd systems.

         <title>Multifunctional Binding Interface Drives Near&#8208;Unity CO Selectivity in Acidic CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of redox&#8208;active isoindigo molecule on Ag catalyst promotes CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to CO in acid. Collective impacts are revealed by combining theoretical, in situ spectroscopic and catalytic analyses. Lewis acid&#8208;base complexation is the dominant contributor with the assistance of intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond and interfacial water network effects, augmenting stabilization and activation of CO2&#8208;bound intermediates.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is challenged by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) especially in acidic media. Here, we elaborate that redox&#8208;active isoindigo, acting as a multifunctional co&#8208;catalyst, can pre&#8208;activate CO2&#8208;bound intermediates and suppress HER upon the synergistic effects of Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct formation, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, and interfacial water structure modulation. Modifying a silver catalyst with isoindigo substantially decreases the energy barrier for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*COOH conversion, which is regarded as the potential&#8208;limiting step of carbon monoxide production. Accordingly, superior catalytic performances are obtained at pH 2, where Faradaic efficiencies surpass 99% at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Moreover, we find that assembling an additional polyamine&#8208;coated layer in front of gas flow channels improves CO2 transport to the catalyst layer, optimizing the trade&#8208;off of conversion and selectivity at low flow rates.

&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction is challenged by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) especially in acidic media. Here, we elaborate that redox-active isoindigo, acting as a multifunctional co-catalyst, can pre-activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bound intermediates and suppress HER upon the synergistic effects of Lewis acid-base adduct formation, intramolecular hydrogen-bond interaction, and interfacial water structure modulation. Modifying a silver catalyst with isoindigo substantially decreases the energy barrier for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-*COOH conversion, which is regarded as the potential-limiting step of carbon monoxide production. Accordingly, superior catalytic performances are obtained at pH 2, where Faradaic efficiencies surpass 99% at industrial-relevant current densities. Moreover, we find that assembling an additional polyamine-coated layer in front of gas flow channels improves CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport to the catalyst layer, optimizing the trade-off of conversion and selectivity at low flow rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustained Release of Underpotential Deposition Initiators for Ah&#8208;Level Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale nickel complex nanofilm sustainably releases nickel ions, precisely controlling zinc deposition to overcome electrolyte&#8208;additive depletion in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With hydrophobic protection and dynamic underpotential deposition initiation, it delivers 30&#160;000 stable cycles, practical Ah&#8208;level pouch cells (1.5&#160;Ah) with high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient photovoltaically re&#8208;charged performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives effectively stabilize aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet their depletion during long&#8208;term cycling leads to eventual battery failure. Here, we address this common issue through sustained release of underpotential deposition initiators from an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve the long&#8208;term operation. This SEI, comprising nickel hydroxide and nickel&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole complexes embedded in a hydrophobic dodecylphosphonic acid (DPA) monolayer via ion&#8208;layer epitaxy, releases Ni2+ ions on&#8208;demand when local pH rises due to corrosion. In this way, the protection through sustained and controlled release of underpotential deposition initiator over long&#8208;term operation is achieved. Concurrently, the hydrophobic DPA layer restricts direct water contact, effectively suppressing side reactions. Consequently, the engineered Ni@DPA&#8208;coated Zn electrode demonstrates remarkable stability, enduring over 37&#160;500 cycles at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full cells retain exceptional cycling performance for over 30&#160;000 cycles at 45&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, achieving an unprecedented energy density of 270&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (1.5&#160;Ah) delivers a high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), maintaining 83% capacity after 400 cycles. Demonstrating practical application, a Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell can be directly charged by an external solar panel with photovoltaic conversion efficiencies up to 10.8%. This approach significantly advances AZIBs toward practical, high&#8208;performance energy storage.

         <title>Dihydroxanthene&#8208;Derived Dioxetane Chemiluminophores for Activatable in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived dioxetane chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) is developed through rational design, structural optimization, and acceptor engineering. DhX&#8208;CLs feature a novel modular core structure, tunable chemiluminescence wavelengths, high quantum yields, long near&#8208;infrared emission, biocompatibility, activatable capability, and in vivo imaging applicability.








Abstract
Chemiluminophores with optimal chemiluminescence properties and versatile structures adaptable into activatable chemiluminescent probes are of particular interest for biosensing and imaging owing to their high sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. However, such chemiluminophores are still limited. Herein, we report dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) that integrate an adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane moiety with a rationally designed dihydroxanthene&#8208;like core skeleton featuring an extended and restricted &#960;&#8208;electron system. Structural optimization of the dihydroxanthene&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;based prototype chemiluminophore generated a bright yellow chemiluminophore DhX&#8208;CL4 with a quantum yield of 35.4% under aqueous conditions, higher than those of existing dioxetanes in the green&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range beyond 500&#160;nm. Further &#960;&#8208;electron extension and acceptor engineering resulted in NIR chemiluminophores with high brightness and biocompatibility. Notably, DhX&#8208;CL7 exhibits long&#8208;lasting chemiluminescence with a maximum NIR emission at 808&#160;nm and a quantum yield 3.17%, higher than those of most reported NIR chemiluminophores. We further demonstrated that caging of these chemiluminophores with analyte&#8208;responsive moieties afforded activatable chemiluminescent probes for in vivo imaging of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and peroxynitrite. Overall, this new family of chemiluminophores, with tunable emission wavelengths and remarkable chemiluminescence properties, serves as a versatile platform for in vivo chemiluminescence imaging.

         <title>A Water Soluble and Solid&#8208;State Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) System as Renewable Solar Fuel</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;A new series of highly water soluble norbornadienes has been synthesized and characterized as molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems in gram scale. Particularly, concentrated solutions (1&#160;M) and solid&#8208;state heat release showed a thermal heat release of 7.5&#160;and 39.6&#160;K, respectively, with full reversibility in both cases. These systems represent a new avenue for transferring the MOST technology to real and sustainable applications.&#8221;








Abstract
Solar energy storage is key to overcome the intermittent character of sunlight. We present a sustainable solution based on norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane pairs for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage working in highly concentrated neutral water solutions and solid state. Photochemical preparation of high&#8208;energy, metastable isomers in previously unattainable 1.64&#160;M solutions was achieved. The best compound can be stored for 1.9 years and is stable in solid state, allowing for the preparation of up to 3&#160;M water solutions. Catalyzed back&#8208;conversion ensures efficient heat release and starting material recovery with remarkable fatigue resistance in water solution and solid state, exhibiting macroscopic heat release in both states, providing a &#916;T of 39.6&#160;K and fully recyclable use. These results highlight a promising avenue for the practical application of MOST technology.

         <title>Competitive Chirality Induction in Two&#8208;dimensional Germanium Iodide Perovskites Enabling Highly Anisotropic Nonlinear Optical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two sets of chiral germanium iodide perovskites (R/S&#8208;BGI and P/M&#8208;BGI) were synthesized through two distinct chiral introduction mechanisms, providing new ideas for the synthesis of chiral metal halides. R&#8208;BGI and P&#8208;BGI exhibit remarkable chiral nonlinear optical properties with extremely high gSHG&#8208;CD of up to 0.71 and 0.83 and high laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the values of most previously reported chiral perovskites.








Abstract
Chiral metal halide perovskites (CMHPs) are a promising class of chiroptical materials with significant potential applications in chiral&#8208;optoelectronic and chiral&#8208;spintronic devices. However, their chirality induction generally stems from the incorporation of chiral ligands, which constitutes compositional diversity and functional versatility. Herein, we report a significant chiral expression resulting from two distinct mechanisms: chirality transfer induced by chiral organic cations and mirror symmetry breaking driven by stereochemically active lone pairs, both contributing to controlled chirality induction. Homochiral germanium iodide perovskites, (R/S&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 (R/S is Rectus/Sinister) can be achieved by employing chiral (R/S)&#8208;BrMBA cations to induce chirality via hydrogen bonding. In contrast, two enantiomorphous helical germanium iodide perovskites, P/M&#8208;(rac&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 (P/M is Plus/Minus&#160;and rac is racemic), are formed via the co&#8208;assembly of racemic rac&#8208;BrMBA cations and germanium iodide networks, where chirality arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the stereochemically active 4s2 electron pair. Remarkably, benefiting from the inherent chirality, both (R&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 and P&#8208;(rac&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 crystals exhibit exceptional anisotropic nonlinear optical properties with large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8208;CD) up to 0.71 and 0.83 and laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most previously reported CMHPs. This study provides insight into the interplay of chiral organic ligands and inorganic ions in the chiral induction, transfer, and functions of metal halide perovskites.

Herein, we report a significant chiral expression resulting from two distinct mechanisms: chirality transfer induced by chiral organic cations and mirror symmetry breaking driven by stereochemically active lone pairs, both contributing to controlled chirality induction. Homochiral germanium iodide perovskites, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt; is Rectus/Sinister) can be achieved by employing chiral (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BrMBA cations to induce chirality via hydrogen bonding. In contrast, two enantiomorphous helical germanium iodide perovskites, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; is Plus/Minus&#160;and &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt; is racemic), are formed via the co-assembly of racemic &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA cations and germanium iodide networks, where chirality arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the stereochemically active 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron pair. Remarkably, benefiting from the inherent chirality, both (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystals exhibit exceptional anisotropic nonlinear optical properties with large anisotropy factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SHG-CD&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 0.71 and 0.83 and laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing most previously reported CMHPs. This study provides insight into the interplay of chiral organic ligands and inorganic ions in the chiral induction, transfer, and functions of metal halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Para&#8208;Substituent Control of Thermal Half&#8208;Lives in Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we provide an overview of photochromic and photophysical properties of a broad variety of arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches, including the influence of 23 different para&#8208;substituents. Measured half&#8208;lives correlated in a Hammet plot are rationalized by density functional theory calculations, revealing the underlying thermal isomerization mechanisms. The nature of the substituent controls the Z/E thermal isomerization pathway.








Abstract
Arylazopyrazoles are versatile photoswitches with excellent photochromic properties and tunable thermal half&#8208;lives, yet the mechanistic role of substituents in controlling thermal stability remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesized an extensive library of arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches and rationalized the influence of para&#8208;substituents on the thermal half&#8208;lives, finding excellent agreement between calculated and measured trends. Calculations show that the electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the substituents modulates the back&#8208;isomerization process through at least two distinct mechanisms. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups enhance delocalization at the azo moiety and thus favor a nonadiabatic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane rotational pathway via the lowest triplet state. In contrast, strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups reduce delocalization and promote a conventional ground state in&#8208;plane inversion mechanism. Intermediate substituents exhibit a gradual shift that combines both major mechanisms. These findings provide prospects for rational design of responsive photoswitches with controllable thermal stability, essential for in vivo applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedron&#8208;to&#8208;Coordination Polymer Transition Revealed by 3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show that 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) is an effective technique to observe structural transformations in porous metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), as well as for obtaining the structure of the activated phases of these materials. A MOP&#8208;to&#8208;coordination polymer transition is revealed, and explains the reduction in cooperative gas uptake by the material as it is mechanically downsized via ball milling.








Abstract
Porous metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) have strong covalent and coordinate bonds that define the intrinsic pore of the cage. The intermolecular interactions between cages tend to be weaker, such that they rearrange during the solvent exchange process preceding gas sorption measurements. The reduction in crystal size that this often causes limits the availability of structural data that could enable understanding of observed gas uptake. Herein, we use 3D electron diffraction (ED) to resolve this problem, and apply this technique to a MOP&#8208;based material that shows cooperative gas capture. 3D ED structure solution reveals both that the MOPs rearrange to form porous 1D polymers, and that these polymers are retained in the activated phase. Molecular simulations using these data suggest gas uptake is facilitated by rotation of functional groups appended to the backbone of the polymers in conjunction with structural expansion as gas is accommodated. Mechanical downsizing of the material leads to the loss of cooperative gas uptake, but a level of porosity is retained, attributed to the conservation of the 1D polymer structure. This work underscores the potential of 3D ED for probing structural transformations in functional supramolecular materials.

         <title>Convergent Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis Synthesis of Ethylene Oxide from CO2 and Water at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrochemical&#8211;chemical system that couples CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C2H4 and two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) toward H2O2 in a single electrolyzer with ambient epoxidation was reported to produce ethylene oxide (EO) from CO2 and H2O.








Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important commodity chemical, and its production currently relies on fossil fuel&#8208;based energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalysis associated with substantial CO2 emissions or the usage of toxic/corrosive precursors (e.g., Cl2). Herein, we report a convergent electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem route for efficient synthesis of EO from CO2 and water under ambient conditions over nonprecious catalysts. Such a protype consists of cathodic CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 and simultaneous anodic two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) to H2O2 in a single electrolyzer, followed by reaction of the two products over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst toward EO with high production rate of 422.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of&#160;&gt;98%. W&#8208;doped CuOx and Cu&#8208;doped SnO2 were used as cathode and anode electrodes with respective Faradaic efficiencies of 63.5% and 75.6% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Systematic characterizations, including 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), isotope&#8208;labeling mass spectrometry (MS), and operando infrared spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that Cu doping breaks the electronic structure symmetry of Sn to induce electron redistribution for optimal adsorption and coupling of key intermediates like *OH in 2e&#8208;WOR. This study offers a sustainable manner for efficient EO synthesis from raw materials with renewable electricity input.

         <title>Dendritic Pillar[6]Arenes with Fixed Planar Chirality for Stereoselective Inclusions in Water: A Case of Facile Differentiation of Cocaine Adulterants, Levamisole and Dexamisole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic pillar[6]arenes encompass a new class of cavitands with planar chirality, unique binding pockets, and great water solubility. These easily accessible hosts permit differentiating racemic dexamisole from levamisole as known cocaine adulterants. Dendritic pillar[6]arenes can now be used for stereoselective recognition, chemosensing, and sequestration of a broad range of chiral drugs. 








Abstract
We describe the preparation, conformational dynamics, and stereoselective recognition characteristics of water&#8208;soluble pillar[6]arenes pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722;. These two novel and diastereomeric cavitands comprise a 2,5&#8208;bis(ethoxy)pillar[6]arene core with one of six phenylene ring conjugated to two hexaanionic dendrons. Each dendron includes an (S)&#8722;glutamic acid amidated with two tris&#8208;carboxylic Behera's amines. Cavitands pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722; were obtained in six synthetic steps and resolved by column chromatography. The results of 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements are in line with pS/pR&#8211;212&#8722; having unidirectional orientation of alkoxy substituents (i.e., planar chirality) and no observable interconversion for, at least, 2 weeks. Computational studies supported with 1H DOSY NMR measurements revealed that sufficiently bulky dendrons require high activation energy to pass through the pillararene's cylindrical cavity therefore inhibiting rotation of the phenylene holding them. With the unique and chiral binding pocket, pS&#8211;212&#8722; (pR&#8211;212&#8722;) formed inclusion complexes with cocaine adulterants levamisole and dexamisole (Kd&#160;&gt;&#160;mM), with their racemic mixture showing separate 1H NMR spectroscopic resonances. In this way, dendritic pillar[6]arenes can be used as chiral shift reagents for determining enantiopurity of pharmaceuticals but also for examining a variety of chiral recognition processes, sensing of chiral molecules, and stereoselective sequestrations in aqueous media.

&lt;p&gt;Dendritic pillar[6]arenes encompass a new class of cavitands with planar chirality, unique binding pockets, and great water solubility. These easily accessible hosts permit differentiating racemic dexamisole from levamisole as known cocaine adulterants. Dendritic pillar[6]arenes can now be used for stereoselective recognition, chemosensing, and sequestration of a broad range of chiral drugs. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the preparation, conformational dynamics, and stereoselective recognition characteristics of water-soluble pillar[6]arenes &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. These two novel and diastereomeric cavitands comprise a 2,5-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(ethoxy)pillar[6]arene core with one of six phenylene ring conjugated to two hexaanionic dendrons. Each dendron includes an (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;glutamic acid amidated with two &lt;i&gt;tris&lt;/i&gt;-carboxylic Behera's amines. Cavitands &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; were obtained in six synthetic steps and resolved by column chromatography. The results of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements are in line with &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; having unidirectional orientation of alkoxy substituents (i.e., planar chirality) and no observable interconversion for, at least, 2 weeks. Computational studies supported with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H DOSY NMR measurements revealed that sufficiently bulky dendrons require high activation energy to pass through the pillararene's cylindrical cavity therefore inhibiting rotation of the phenylene holding them. With the unique and chiral binding pocket, &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) formed inclusion complexes with cocaine adulterants levamisole and dexamisole (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;mM), with their racemic mixture showing separate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopic resonances. In this way, dendritic pillar[6]arenes can be used as chiral shift reagents for determining enantiopurity of pharmaceuticals but also for examining a variety of chiral recognition processes, sensing of chiral molecules, and stereoselective sequestrations in aqueous media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Dissipation Mediated by Multiple Noncovalent Interactions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Hydrogels for Wearable Gesture&#8208;to&#8208;Recognition Translation</title>

         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;hard multiphase hydrogels have been constructed using hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and polymerized deep eutectic solvent, the multiple noncovalent interactions facilitate the energy dissipation and ion transport, leading to remarkable strength, toughness and ionic conductivity. They could be used as strain sensors for health monitoring and gesture&#8208;to&#8208;recognition translation.








Abstract
Hydrogels hold great promises in intelligent wearable gesture&#8208;to&#8208;recognition translation devices, but high mechanical robustness usually encounters low sensitivity and poor cycling stability, it is pivotal and challenging to balance energy dissipation and conductivity. Herein, the soft&#8208;hard multiphase hydrogels have been proposed for the first time through noncovalently threading polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Fluorine groups on HOF (HOF&#8208;F) are presented as the hydrogen bond acceptors to form multiple noncovalent interactions between HOF&#8208;F and PDES, which expedites the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport in hydrogels. The tensile strength, toughness and ionic conductivity are as high as 135.23&#160;kPa, 2.69&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and 4.33&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly outperforms that of H&#8208;substituted counterpart (60.04&#160;kPa, 0.75&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and 3.74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08 S m&#8722;1) and ranks the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves high sensitivity of 2.2 and remarkable cyclic stability over 1000 cycles, thus accurately monitoring human motion and recognizing the gesture. This work provides a promising approach to develop smart flexible electronics.

         <title>Programmable Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Through Stereocontrol of Chiral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral inducers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) with varying binaphthalene dihedral angles were selected with achiral liquid crystalline polymer PyP to form chiral co&#8208;assemblies. As the dihedral angle of the binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9 could emit inverted and amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence with a |gEL| value up to 0.18 compared with (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) are essential to prospective 3D displays and advanced polarized lighting systems. The rational design of programmable circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) materials with a large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (gEL) remains a great challenge and is still in its preliminary exploration phase. In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE&#8208;active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) and achiral acrylate&#8208;based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. Interestingly, as the dihedral angle of the AIE&#8208;active binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2&#8208;PyP) could emit inverted and amplified CP&#8208;EL signals compared with S&#8208;/R&#8208;1&#8208;PyP after annealing. Significantly, the (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs displayed remarkable blue CP&#8208;EL (&#955;EL&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nm, Lmax&#160;=&#160;14860&#160;cd m&#8722;2) with a record |gEL| value of up to 0.18 in chiral co&#8208;assembled CP&#8208;OLEDs to date. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CP&#8208;EL with tunable signal direction and intensity through stereocontrol of AIE&#8208;active chiral inducers in LCP co&#8208;assembled films, providing a valuable guidance for realizing programmable CP&#8208;EL.

RHM enables adaptive water capture and release in AZIBs, promoting uniform Zn deposition, fast Zn2&#8314; transport, and stable cycling.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, uncontrolled interfacial water remains a major hurdle, limiting both anode stability and ion transport. In this study, 2&#8208;picolinaldehyde (2PA) was chosen as a reversible hydration modulator (RHM) that enables dynamic regulation of interfacial free water. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that RHM captures excess water during plating to suppress hydrogen evolution and corrosion while releasing water during stripping to facilitate Zn2+ solvation and migration. In addition, RHM coordinates with Zn2+ and reorganizes its local coordination environment. Consequently, symmetric cells with the RHM&#8208;ZnSO4 electrolyte deliver prolonged cycling exceeding 4000&#160;h and excellent rate performance, with low voltage polarization even at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The corresponding full cells demonstrate durable operation for over 5000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This adaptive behavior satisfies the distinct interfacial water requirements during Zn plating and stripping, enabling interfacial stability and efficient ion transport, and provides a novel strategy for electrolyte design in AZIBs.

         <title>Antiferroelectric SnO2 Network with Amorphous Surface for Electrochemical N2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study report the utilization of antiferroelectric dipole configurations to engineer oriented electric fields to synergistically couple N2 adsorption. Building on this foundation, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surface was engineered to maximize N2 adsorption efficiency and active site accessibility. As a result, this design achieves one of the highest performance and efficiency reported to date for aqueous electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen fixation&#8208;a sustainable pathway for converting abundant N2 into NH3 using renewable energy&#8208;holds transformative potential for revolutionizing artificial nitrogen cycles. Nevertheless, even the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems also suffer from inadequate N2 adsorption capacity, which critically limits ammonia production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). To overcome this bottleneck, we strategically leveraged the antiferroelectric properties of SnO2 to establish dipole&#8211;dipole interactions with N2 molecules, synergistically enhancing both N2 adsorption and activation kinetics. Building on this foundation, we construct a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surfaces. Both experiment and first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that all the exposed antiferroelectric surfaces could effectively adsorb N2, enhancing the N2 adsorption ability and maximizing active sites accessibility. The optimized catalyst delivers exceptional performance, achieving an NH3 production rate of 57.38&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1mg&#8722;1cat and a FE of 33.26%, representing one of the highest reported values among aqueous&#8208;phase ammonia synthesis catalysts. These breakthroughs not only establish a universal design framework for gas&#8208;involving electrocatalysts but also pioneer an integrated strategy to elevate nitrogen utilization efficiency in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy infrastructures.

         <title>Unlocks Photoluminescence Quantum Efficiency Enhancement in Eu2+&#8208;Doped Phosphors via Bond Angle Variance Index</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and quantitatively prediction of high&#8208;efficiency Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors via crystallochemical descriptors are urgently needed. Here, we pioneered a linear equation between PLQY and Bav in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and achieves 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement by controlling bond angle variance (Bav).








Abstract
Rational design of inorganic luminescent materials with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has long been constrained by the absence of precise structural descriptors. Here, we realizes a giant 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and demonstrates that bond angle variance (Bav, &#948;2) can be used as a universal crystallochemical metric. By decoupling the contributions from structural rigidity, thermal quenching (TQ), and cation disorder, we identify isovalent Lu3+ substitution&#8208;driven Bav engineering, and further establish a predictive Bav&#8208;PLQY linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.95) via a generalized distortion quantification model for irregular polyhedra (CN&#160;=&#160;7). Local structure characterization and bond valence sum (Bvs) analyses reveal that &#948;2 modulation optimizes the coordination environments for Eu2+ incorporation while enhancing radiative transitions. This work bridges lattice distortion to PLQY via the Bav descriptor, offering a predictive route toward designing inorganic phosphor and advancing material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to database approaches.

         <title>In Situ Nanoscale Probing of Lithium&#8208;Aluminum Alloying / De&#8208;Alloying Kinetics and Mechanical Failure in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy (OM), we directly observed the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure of the Al&#8208;Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Furthermore, a co&#8208;sintering interfacial optimization was applied to decrease the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure and increase the cycle stability of Li&#8208;anode&#8208;less ASSBs.








Abstract
Alloy anodes with high specific capacity are extensively utilized in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, they are challenged by interfacial kinetic and mechanical issues. Real&#8208;time investigation of interfacial failure mechanisms at the nanoscale is crucial for optimizing the alloy anodes. Utilizing the high spatial resolution and real&#8208;time imaging capabilities of electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM), we discovered that Li1Al1 alloying unevenly, and the delithiated phase Al with its sluggish kinetics hinders the de&#8208;alloying processes. Combining the high mechanical modulus of Li1Al1 and Al leads to electrode fracture. This kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure diminishes the reversibility of the Al anode. To weaken the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure, we employ a co&#8208;sintering reaction between Al and Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl), introducing Al2S3 and P2S74&#8722;, followed by Al2S3 in situ lithiation to Li9Al4. This process improved interfacial charge transfer and mitigated mechanical failure. Consequently, the Li&#8208;anode&#8208;less ASSBs maintain 90.2% retention rate after 2000&#160;h (420 cycles) and 87.4% retention rate after 3500&#160;h (750 cycles) at an areal capacity of 2.9&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and low N/P ratio of 1.8 with a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Such tracking of the alloy interfacial reaction provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupled failure and thus benefits the alloy anode optimization.

         <title>Creating Abundant Open Metal Sites in MOFs by Dual&#8208;Coordination Design for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coordination strategy is developed to create abundant unsaturated metal sites in MOFs while preserving their crystalline framework, enabling precise structure&#8211;property studies and enhanced electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined crystalline structures offer ideal platforms to unravel structure&#8211;property relationships, but their low density of accessible metal sites limits catalytic activation. Efforts to generate open metal sites often compromise structural integrity, obstructing mechanistic investigation. In this study, we convert single&#8208;coordinated MOFs into dual&#8208;coordinated frameworks, enabling controlled creation of unsaturated metal sites to boost electrocatalytic performance while preserving crystal framework for structure&#8211;property study. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we transform Zn&#9472;N single&#8208;coordinated ZIF&#8208;L into Zn&#9472;N/O dual&#8208;coordinated MOFs (B&#8208;MOFs), where strong Zn&#9472;N bonds act as structural pillars and weaker Zn&#9472;O bonds serve as removable linkers. Upon annealing at 500&#160;&#176;C, selective cleavage of Zn&#9472;O bonds produces defective MOFs (dB&#8208;MOFs) with abundant open Zn sites and a well&#8208;retained crystal structure. The dB&#8208;MOF grown on carbon cloth (CC) exhibits high performance in hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), significantly superior to pristine B&#8208;MOF/CC. A combination of material characterizations and theoretical calculation demonstrates that the removal of Zn&#9472;O bond creates abundant electron&#8208;deficient Zn sites, which enhance the adsorption of HzOR intermediates and lower the reaction energy barriers.

Reduction of an amidinate&#8208;stabilized zinc iodide with KC8 in the presence of cAAC affords a crystalline zinc&#8211;cAAC radical. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculation reveal the radical's properties, and reactivity studies demonstrate its zinc&#8208;centered radical behavior toward diverse substrates. 








Abstract
Reaction of LAmZnI [LAm&#160;=&#160;tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] with KC8 in the presence of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) affords a stable radical complex [LAmZn(cAAC)]&#8226; (3). Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis of 3 shows a short Zn&#9472;C bond and concomitant elongation of C&#9472;N bond within the cAAC ligand, indicating a significant &#960;&#8208;backbonding from the metal to the cAAC ligand. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that the spin density is mainly localized on the carbenic carbon atom, with a small portion on the zinc center. Complex 3 exhibits zinc&#8208;centered radical reactivity as demonstrated by reactions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy, iodobenzene, trimethylsilyl azide, and [FeCp(CO)2]2, all of which occur at the zinc center and yield the corresponding Zn(II) complexes.

         <title>Amino Nests Boost Pd/SiO2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd single atoms anchored within the amino nest on the SiO2&#8208;NH2 support (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2) were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene with an amazing specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that amino nests can selectively capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step over the Pd single atoms.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is a critical industrial process for purifying ethylene feedstocks. Palladium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pd SACs) exhibit exceptional ethylene selectivity in this hydrogenation reaction. However, their isolated active sites show limited ability to capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, resulting in relatively low hydrogenation activity. To overcome this limitation, we designed Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst on the SiO2 surface modified with amino nests (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2). In this architecture, Pd single atoms are embedded within amino nests on the surface of SiO2&#8208;NH2 support. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amino nests selectively capture and adsorb acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step. The Pd&#9472;N bonds formed between the amino nest and the Pd atom promote hydrogen activation. At 190 &#176;C, the Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2 catalyst achieves complete acetylene conversion with the ethylene selectivity of 92%. Remarkably, it delivers a specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported SACs. This work establishes an amino nest&#8208;assisted design paradigm for single&#8208;atom catalysts, enabling efficient, selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene.

         <title>Mechanistically Engineered Heterojunction From Spent LFP for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;guided upcycling strategy converts spent LFP into a coronal NiO/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/LFP(III) heterostructure, achieving nanoscale surface activation for electrocatalysis. The engineered p&#8211;n interface enables lattice oxygen catalysis, while the PO43&#8722;&#8208;rich matrix ensures Cl&#8722; resistance, delivering high OER performance and a six&#8208;fold cost&#8208;efficiency gain over conventional recycling.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale retirement of LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries demands sustainable strategies for material recovery and functional repurposing. However, the inert micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and electronically stable lattice of spent LFP hinder its direct catalytic reuse. Herein, we present a structure&#8208;guided strategy that upcycles spent LFP into a high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Mild air oxidation transforms LFP into a phosphate&#8208;rich Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (LFP(III)) framework decorated with coronal &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots. This reconfiguration preserves the bulk structure while achieving nanoscale surface activation. Subsequent spatially selective growth of NiO on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 yields a well&#8208;defined p&#8208;NiO/n&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction, driving interfacial charge redistribution and promoting formation of catalytically active NiOOH species under operational conditions. In situ Raman and XPS analyses reveal that the heterostructure facilitates lattice oxygen participation via an accelerated lattice oxygen mechanism, while the phosphate&#8208;rich LFP(III) matrix imparts strong electrostatic repulsion toward Cl&#8722;, effectively suppressing halide&#8208;induced corrosion. The resulting LFP(III)/NiO catalyst achieves low overpotentials of 268 and 292&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in chloride&#8208;containing electrolytes, along with excellent durability. Techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates a six&#8208;fold improvement in cost&#8208;efficiency over conventional recycling. This work establishes a mechanistically informed and energy&#8208;efficient upcycling strategy that bridges battery waste management with functional catalyst design, advancing both sustainable materials chemistry and water&#8208;splitting technologies.

         <title>Ligand Engineering&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;Siloxane Clusters for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz nanoclusters are surgically sculpted into the octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC) configuration through ligand engineering, where each ligand in OZSBPC is adorned with an appended benzene ring. Benefitting from the electronic and molecular modulation effect of benzene rings, the reinforced electrical conductivity, sulfur loading capacity, and adsorption characteristics are endowed to the OZSBPC, ultimately achieving the optimization of lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic performance.








Abstract
Polynuclear metal clusters (PMC) with atomically defined architectures exhibit unique electrochemical catalytic behaviors in lithium&#8722;sulfur battery (LSB). Nevertheless, the precise fabrication of PMC with tailored configurations, and a comprehensive understanding of their structure&#8208;dependent property evolution, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, ligand engineering is employed to upgrade octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz clusters by grafting one more benzene ring onto azopyrazole ligand to form octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC). An integrated investigation combining kinetic analyses, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveals that the introduction of biphenyl moieties enlarges the intrinsic cavity to host more sulfur species, while the conjugation&#8208;enhanced ligand framework facilitates more efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the enhanced nucleophilicity at nitrogen sites and the upshifted d&#8208;band center synergistically strengthen the affinity toward polysulfides via &#960;&#8722;&#960; conjugation interactions. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of OZSBPC undergoes a substantial enhancement, thereby enabling the assembled Ah&#8208;class Li&#8722;S pouch cell delivers a peak energy density of 504&#160;Wh&#160;kgtotal&#8722;1, and sustains stable cycling at 429&#160;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1 for 40 cycles. Moreover, stable operation over 150 cycles is achieved under &#8722;33&#160;&#176;C. Our study makes a breakthrough in precisely constructing PMC and in optimizing the performance via progressive structure upgrading, which made a landmark impact on lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic chemistry.

Benefitting from the electronic and molecular modulation effect of benzene rings, the reinforced electrical conductivity, sulfur loading capacity, and adsorption characteristics are endowed to the OZSBPC, ultimately achieving the optimization of lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polynuclear metal clusters (PMC) with atomically defined architectures exhibit unique electrochemical catalytic behaviors in lithium&#8722;sulfur battery (LSB). Nevertheless, the precise fabrication of PMC with tailored configurations, and a comprehensive understanding of their structure-dependent property evolution, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, ligand engineering is employed to upgrade octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz clusters by grafting one more benzene ring onto azopyrazole ligand to form octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC). An integrated investigation combining kinetic analyses, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveals that the introduction of biphenyl moieties enlarges the intrinsic cavity to host more sulfur species, while the conjugation-enhanced ligand framework facilitates more efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the enhanced nucleophilicity at nitrogen sites and the upshifted d-band center synergistically strengthen the affinity toward polysulfides via &#960;&#8722;&#960; conjugation interactions. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of OZSBPC undergoes a substantial enhancement, thereby enabling the assembled Ah-class Li&#8722;S pouch cell delivers a peak energy density of 504&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and sustains stable cycling at 429&#160;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 40 cycles. Moreover, stable operation over 150 cycles is achieved under &#8722;33&#160;&#176;C. Our study makes a breakthrough in precisely constructing PMC and in optimizing the performance via progressive structure upgrading, which made a landmark impact on lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>LL&#8208;37 and Its Truncated Fragments Modulate Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Dynamics, Aggregation and Toxicity Through Hetero&#8208;Oligomer and Cluster Formation</title>

LL&#8208;37 and its truncates modulate A&#946;40 primary nucleation by forming hetero&#8208;oligomers, nanoclusters, and microclusters, which act as off&#8208;pathway aggregates inhibiting fibrillation. These transient assemblies influence fibril progression and cytotoxicity, highlighting the dynamic interplay between aggregation and toxicity. Integrating nanoscale and microscale perspectives provides mechanistic insight into A&#946;40&#8211;LL&#8208;37 interactions and informs therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
LL&#8208;37 and its variants with amphiphilic structure can modulate amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibril formation, but the detailed mechanism behind it is still unclear. By using four different peptides (LL&#8208;37, LL&#8208;379&#8211;32, LL&#8208;3718&#8211;29, LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28), we found these peptides affect A&#946;40 aggregation differently. Nanoscale analysis showed that all LL&#8208;37 peptides form hetero&#8208;oligomers and nanoclusters with A&#946;40, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28, which exhibit the strongest inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, form more hetero&#8208;oligomers and smaller nanoclusters. This suggests that hetero&#8208;oligomers and small nanoclusters may represent an off&#8208;pathway, preventing the formation of productive aggregates. At the microscale, all LL&#8208;37 peptides were found to promote A&#946; cluster formation, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 can form larger clusters with A&#946; rapidly, emphasizing that smaller nanoclusters can assemble to macroscale clusters easier, inducing more toxic aggregates. Both nanoscopic and microscopic mechanisms revealed inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation by all LL&#8208;37 peptides, impacting A&#946; primary and secondary nucleation, while only LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 affected A&#946; elongation. Our findings highlight the role of LL&#8208;37 and its synthetic fragments in A&#946;40 aggregation across different scales, particularly focusing on cluster formation at the nanoscale and microscale to fill the knowledge gap between oligomerization and fibrillation.

         <title>Harnessing Dual Hydrogen Bonding and Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Interactions for Bio&#8208;Inspired Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Electrolytes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Bio&#8208;inspired symmetry disruption in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries: Isobutyramide simultaneously breaks hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and coordinates Zn2+ ions, tailoring solvation structure and stabilizing Zn anodes. This molecular&#8208;level electrolyte engineering suppresses dendrites, mitigates hydrogen evolution, and enables long&#8208;lasting, high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) offer a safe, cost&#8208;effective alternative for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are hindered by zinc dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. These challenges largely stem from strong dipole interactions between symmetric water molecules and Zn2+, which destabilize the electric double layer (EDL) and trigger parasitic reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological systems that use asymmetric molecular interactions to regulate aqueous environments, we introduce isobutyramide (IAM) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive. IAM features both carbonyl and amide groups, enabling it to act as a dual&#8208;site hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. This disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in water, reduces water activity, and suppresses HER. Additionally, IAM's lone pairs coordinate strongly with Zn2+, restructuring the solvation sheath and mitigating uncontrolled Zn2+ migration that leads to dendrite formation. This dual&#8208;function, symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy stabilizes the EDL, enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility, and suppresses interfacial degradation. Electrochemical tests confirm IAM's efficacy: Zn||Cu cells exhibit 99.68% Coulombic efficiency over 1,000 cycles, Zn||Zn symmetric cells remain stable for over 4,250&#160;h, and full&#8208;cell Zn||V2O5 and Zn||I2 systems show significantly enhanced cycling performance. Zn||I2 pouch cells also demonstrate robust long&#8208;term operation. This bio&#8208;inspired approach offers a scalable path to high&#8208;performance, practical aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;Labeled Oximes by Alloy Synergy Activation and Hydroxylamine Overhydrogenation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

BixMoy alloys are designed to electrocatalytic conversion of 15NO2&#8210; to 15N&#8208;oxime with a 76% Faradaic efficiency and 88% yield at 3.0 A. Mo serves as the H2O activation site, whereas Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8210; activation site. The synergy between Bi and Mo leads to a high 15N&#8208;oxime formation rate. Moreover, Mo introduction increases the hydrogenation energy barrier for 15NH2OH to 15NH3, suppressing 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and therefore improving 15N&#8208;oxime Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
15N&#8208;labeled molecules are essential for industrial drug development and medical imageology. However, the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled molecules suffers from the complex procedure of de novo synthesis and harsh conditions. Here, we propose an electrochemical strategy to synthesize 15N&#8208;labeled oximes (15N&#8208;oximes) from 15N&#8208;labeled nitrites (15NO2&#8722;) and aldehydes/ketones. Matching the adsorption and activation of H2O and 15NO2&#8722; and inhibiting 15NH2OH overhydrogenation are the keys to realizing efficient ampere&#8208;level electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled oximes. A bismuth&#8722;molybdenum (BiMo) alloy catalyst is subsequently designed, in which Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8722; activation site, whereas Mo serves as the H2O activation site. The precisely controlled atomic ratio of Mo and Bi ensures that there is sufficient but not excessive active hydrogen provided for 15NO2&#8722; hydrogenation and therefore accelerates the reaction rate. Moreover, Mo incorporation increases the energy barrier of 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and thus improves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 15N&#8208;oxime. This strategy enables scale&#8208;up electrosynthesis with a 76% FE and 88% yield at a current of 3.0 A to obtain 3.5 g of 15N&#8208;cyclohexanone oxime within 1.5 h. The application potential is highlighted by the methodological universality of diverse 15N&#8208;oximes, the extended synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled drug molecules and their application in 2D magnetic resonance imaging visualization.

         <title>Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Amides via Photoredox Catalysis and Triple Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with amides are achieved under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity, along with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Its versatility is highlighted by diverse late&#8208;stage modification and synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via a triple hydrogen atom transfer process involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular steps.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated hydroalkylation of alkenes offers a more direct and atom&#8208;economical route to &#945;&#8208;alkylated carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of various drug scaffolds, natural products, and functional molecules. However, traditional protocols are generally restricted to active 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and often require oxidants, large excesses of substrates, and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we present a photoinduced, general, and practical hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with amides. Both inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydroalkylation reactions are achieved under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. This method demonstrates excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity, along with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. A range of short&#8208;chain gaseous olefins, including ethylene, can also undergo the reaction successfully. Its versatility is further highlighted by diverse late&#8208;stage modification and synthesis of structurally complex bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via a triple hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular steps. The success of this chemistry is attributed to the controlled generation of relatively weak electrophilic &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals and the strategic application of radical polarity&#8208;match/mismatch effect to finely tune the reactivity between distinct radical species and unactivated alkenes or the HAT donor.

         <title>H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ Comproportionation Enables Stable Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F Solid Electrolyte</title>

H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation serves as an effective chemical driven force for achieving the Li2+xNHFx&#8211;LiF solid electrolyte from LiH and NH4F precursor, which enables the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to the accelerated Li&#8208;ion migration in Li2+xNHFx, favorable in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphase at the electrode surface and the enhanced mechanical strengths.








Abstract
Nitride family compounds are among the earliest explored materials for solid electrolytes (SEs). The main challenge lies in effectively enhancing their electrochemical stability without compromising their excellent Li&#8208;ion conductivity and Li metal compatibility. Herein, a H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation reaction between LiH and NH4F is employed to synthesize a Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex, consisting of Li2+xNHFx matrix and dispersed LiF nanoparticles. Density functional calculation results show that the incorporated F atoms in Li2NH lattice lead to structural variation and electron density redistribution, providing a more connected Li&#8208;ion network with low migration energy barriers. More importantly, the interfacial side reactions between the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex and electrodes are strongly self&#8208;limited due to the blocking effect of the in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphases. The newly identified interphase Li4NH exhibits fast Li&#8208;ion migration ability and intrinsic stability toward Li, facilitating stable Li plating/stripping. Based on the superiority in Li&#8208;ion conduction and electrode compatibility, the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F solid electrolyte films prepared via cold pressing with 0.5 wt% binder enable stable cycling of Li||Li, Li||TiS2, and Li||LiCoO2 all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Micellar Brush&#8208;Directed Oxophilic Zr&#8208;Doped RuO2 Nanoarrays for Durable Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes guide the dense accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr&#8308;&#8314; ions through coordination interactions and enable the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray after calcination. The oxophilic Zr stabilizes the lattice oxygen and creates electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites, which facilitate the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER performance.








Abstract
Although being considered as a promising alternative to iridium&#8208;based catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE), cost&#8208;effective ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based anodic catalysts generally lack sufficient stability for harsh operating conditions. Here, we developed a facile method to fabricate erect nanoarrays of interweaved nanorods of zirconium&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (ZrRuO2) for long&#8208;term industrial&#8208;level oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is accomplished by the spontaneous and abundant accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr4+ ions in pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes through coordination interactions, followed by direct calcination in air. The uniform dispersion of Ru and Zr precursors promotes the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray and the formation of Zr&#8208;OBRI&#8208;Ru bridging oxygen structures. The oxophilic Zr strengthens the stability of the lattice oxygen and prevents its participation in OER. Meanwhile, it also leads to electron deficiency of the bridging Ru sites and facilitates the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER stability and activity. Notably, the nanoarray architecture synergistically restricts the voltage loss caused by electron and mass transport. Consequently, the ZrRuO2&#8208;nanoarrays enabled a remarkably low PEM&#8208;WE potential of 1.64&#160;V at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 with a negligible degradation rate (26 &#181;V h&#8722;1, over 1000&#160;h).
