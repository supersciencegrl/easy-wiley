         <title>Electrochemical reactors for continuously decentralized H2O2 production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global utilization of H  2  O  2  is currently around 4 million tons per annum and expected to continue growing in the future. H  2  O  2  is mainly produced by the anthraquinone process, which involves multiple steps in terms of alkylanthraquinone hydrogenation/oxidation in organic solvents and liquid&#8208;liquid extraction of H  2  O  2  . The energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally unfriendly anthraquinone process doesn&#8217;t meet the need of the sustainable and low&#8208;carbon development. The electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron (2e  &#8208;  ) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) driven by the renewable energy (e.g. solar and wind power) offers a more economical, low&#8208;carbon and greener route to produce H  2  O  2  . However, continuous and decentralized H  2  O  2  electrosynthesis still remains many challenges. This review firstly summarizes the development of devices for H  2  O  2  electrosynthesis, and then introduces each component, assembly process and some optimization strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Quantum Tunnelling in Spin Crossovers of Nitrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We simulate two recent matrix&#8208;isolation experiments at cryogenic temperatures, in which a nitrene undergoes spin crossover from its triplet state to a singlet state via quantum tunnelling. We detail the failure of the commonly applied weak&#8208;coupling method (based on a linear approximation of the potentials) in describing these deep&#8208;tunnelling reactions. The more rigorous approach of semiclassical golden&#8208;rule instanton theory in conjunction with double&#8208;hybrid density&#8208;functional theory and multireference perturbation theory does, however, provide rate constants and kinetic isotope effects in good agreement with experiment. In addition, these calculations locate the optimal tunnelling pathways, which provide a molecular picture of the reaction mechanism. The reactions involve substantial heavy&#8208;atom quantum tunnelling of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which unexpectedly even continues to play a role at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Doped Quintuple [9]helicene&#160;with Azacorannulene as Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a hetero(S,N)&#8208;quintuple [9]helicene (  SNQ9H  ) molecule with an azacorannulene core was synthesized, currently representing the highest hetero&#8208;helicene reported in the field of multiple [n]helicenes. X&#8208;ray crystallography indicated that  SNQ9H  includes not only a propeller&#8208;shaped conformer  SNQ9H&#8208;1  , but also an unforeseen quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformer  SNQ9H&#8208;2  . Different conformers were observed for the first time in multiple [n &#8805; 9]helicenes, likely owing to the doping of heteroatomic sulfurs in the helical skeletons. Remarkably, the ratio of  SNQ9H&#8208;1  to  SNQ9H&#8208;2  can be regulated  in situ  by the reaction temperature. Experimental studies on the photophysical and redox properties of  SNQ9H  and theoretical calculations clearly demonstrated that the electronic structures of  SNQ9H  depend on their molecular conformations. The strategy of introducing heteroatomic sulfurs into the helical skeleton may be useful in constructing various conformers of higher multiple [n]helicenes in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Laser From Solution&#8208;grown Grating&#8208;patterned Perovskite Single&#8208;crystal Microdisks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed, high&#8208;gain, and wavelength&#8208;tunable perovskite single&#8208;crystal microdisk (PVKsc&#8208;MD) lasers have emerged as prospective coherent light sources in advanced nanophotonic designs. However, the inevitable multi&#8208;directional emission from a highly symmetrical cavity leads to low light collection efficiency which greatly hinder its application in integrated opticial circuits.Here, we report on surface&#8208;patterned MAPbBr  3  PVKsc&#8208;MDs synthesized by a cost&#8208;efficient bottom&#8208;up solution process employing spin&#8208;coating and confined&#8208;growth nanoimprinting. The patterned microdisks have high crystal quality with regular shape and sharp edges and nano&#8208;grating structure on the upper surface. This straightforward process yields surface&#8208;patterned PVKsc&#8208;MD lasers with a low lasing threshold and high Q factor. In addition, the grating structure patterned on the PVKsc&#8208;MDs reduces the original symmetry of the laser cavity, which improves the emission directionality four times.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Diamination of Arylcyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a short time, direct C(sp3)&#8722;H diamination of arylcyclobutanes catalyzed by rhodium(II) was successfully achieved in one step. Unlike the classical rhodium(II) nitrene reaction, this cascade reaction consists of nine elementary steps, in which the multiple consecutive oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossovers, desaturation, and nitrogen&#8208;radical addition are the major chemical transformations.







Abstract
Activated by multiple consecutive oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover and desaturation processes, the selective diamination of arylcyclobutanes, which is difficult to perform by classical metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion, was achieved in a short time by rhodium(II) catalysis using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant and nitrogen source.

         <title>Unprecedented Ferroelectricity and Ferromagnetism in a Cr2+&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3,3&#8208;Difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CrCl4 is a Cr2+&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite that displays both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It shows ferroelectricity with a high ferroelectric Curie temperature (Tc) up to 387&#8197;K and a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits soft ferromagnet properties with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have gained tremendous interest for their rich functional properties. However, the coexistence of more than one of ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity has been rarely found in OIHPs. Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional Cr2+&#8208;based OIHP, [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CrCl4 ([DFCBA]2CrCl4), which shows both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It undergoes a 4/mmmFm type ferroelectric phase transition at a temperature as high as 387&#8197;K and shows multiaxial ferroelectricity with a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It acts as a soft ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K. This work throws light on the exploration of OIHPs with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for applications in future multifunctional smart devices.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 387&#8197;K and a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits soft ferromagnet properties with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have gained tremendous interest for their rich functional properties. However, the coexistence of more than one of ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity has been rarely found in OIHPs. Herein, we report a two-dimensional Cr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based OIHP, [3,3-difluorocyclobutylammonium]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([DFCBA]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which shows both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It undergoes a 4/&lt;i&gt;mmmFm&lt;/i&gt; type ferroelectric phase transition at a temperature as high as 387&#8197;K and shows multiaxial ferroelectricity with a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It acts as a soft ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K. This work throws light on the exploration of OIHPs with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for applications in future multifunctional smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Electrophilic Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) is reported. The reaction proceeds by asymmetric 1,6&#8208;addition to p&#8208;quinone diimines to deliver atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles in good yields and with excellent ee values.







Abstract
Reported here is the first catalytic atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles, which delivers functionalized atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles with excellent optical purity. This reaction was furnished by 1,6&#8208;nucleophilic addition to p&#8208;quinone diimines. Control experiments suggest an ionic mechanism that differs from the radical addition pathway commonly proposed for 1,6&#8208;addition to quinones. The origin of 1,6&#8208;addition selectivity was investigated through computational studies. Preliminary studies show that the obtained 3&#8208;aminoindoles atropisomers exhibit anticancer activities. This method is valuable with respect to enlarging the toolbox for atropochiral amine derivatives.

         <title>Preparation of Functionalized Amides Using Dicarbamoylzincs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfunctional dicarbamoylzincs of type (R1R2NCO)2Zn were prepared in THF by treating a mixture of formamides and ZnCl2 with LiTMP (THF, 15&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;min) or by reacting formamides with TMP2Zn (THF, 25&#8201;&#176;C, 16&#8197;h). These zinc reagents reacted with allylic, benzylic, aryl and alkenyl bromides, acid chlorides, aldehydes or enones providing various amides in 47&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. 13C NMR data showed a characteristic carbonyl signal at 219.4&#8197;ppm for (Bu2NCO)2Zn.







Abstract
We report a new convenient preparation of dicarbamoylzincs of type (R1R2NCO)2Zn by the treatment of ZnCl2 and formamides R1R2NCHO with LiTMP in THF (15&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;min) or by the reaction of formamides R1R2NCHO with TMP2Zn (25&#8201;&#176;C, 16&#8197;h). This second method tolerates sensitive groups such as an ester, ketone or nitro function. Reaction of these dicarbamoylzincs with allylic, benzylic, aryl, alkenyl bromides, acid chlorides, aldehydes or enones provided various polyfunctional amides in 47&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. 13C NMR characterization of these new carbamoylzinc derivatives is reported.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic catalyst for CO2 photoreduction was developed through self&#8208;assembling porphyrins into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, as reported by Tian&#8208;Fu Liu, Rong Cao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203955). The combination of photosensitizers and redox centers in the structure not only allows for adequate photon input and efficient utilization of the photogenerated charge, but also changes the microenvironment surrounding the active sites.

         <title>Merging the Non&#8208;Natural Catalytic Activity of Lipase and Electrosynthesis: Asymmetric Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Amines with Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric oxidative cross&#8208;coupling strategy that combines the non&#8208;natural catalytic activity of lipase with organic electrosynthesis was developed. This unprecedented protocol demonstrates that hydrolase catalysis is compatible with electrosynthesis.







Abstract
We describe the enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of secondary amines with ketones by combining the non&#8208;natural catalytic activity of lipase with electrosynthesis. Various 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;carbonyl indoles with a stereogenic quaternary carbon center were synthesized from 2&#8208;substituted indoles in yields up to 78&#8201;% with good enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r. and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.). This unprecedented protocol demonstrated that hydrolase catalysis is compatible with electrosynthesis, and the reaction can be carried out in organic solvents with a broad substrate scope and good stereoselectivity. This work provides insights into enzymatic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Supported Anionic Gold Nanoparticle Catalysts Modified Using Highly Negatively Charged Multivacant Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is reported for the design of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts modified using highly negatively charged multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates. Enhanced catalytic activity and stability of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts was accessed in the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of piperidone derivatives to the corresponding enaminones.







Abstract
Although supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts have been theoretically investigated for their efficacy in activating O2 in aerobic oxidation reactions, limited studies have been reported due to the difficulty of designing these catalysts. Herein, we developed a feasible method for preparing supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts using multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates with high negative charges. We confirmed the strong and robust electronic interaction between gold nanoparticles and multivacant lacunary polyoxometalates, and the electronic states of the supported gold nanoparticle catalysts can be sequentially modulated. Particularly, the catalyst prepared using [SiW9O34]10&#8722; acted as an efficient reusable heterogeneous catalyst, showing superior catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of piperidone derivatives to the corresponding enaminones and remarkably higher stability than supported gold nanoparticle catalysts without this modification.

         <title>Comparative Evaluation of Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis: A Framework for Standardized Reporting of Data
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Scientific Perspective describes current challenges in determining, reporting, and comparing performance indicators in homogeneous and heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis. The need for comparative data analysis in the field is highlighted, and its role in future data reporting and big&#8208;data analysis is discussed. A minimum set of experimental parameters to be reported for light&#8208;driven catalysis is proposed.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis require a complex interplay between light absorption, charge separation, charge transfer, and catalytic turnover. Optical and irradiation parameters as well as reaction engineering aspects play major roles in controlling catalytic performance. This multitude of factors makes it difficult to objectively compare light&#8208;driven catalysts and provide an unbiased performance assessment. This Scientific Perspective highlights the importance of collecting and reporting experimental data in homogeneous and heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis. A critical analysis of the benefits and limitations of the commonly used experimental indicators is provided. Data collection and reporting according to FAIR principles is discussed in the context of future automated data analysis. The authors propose a minimum dataset as a basis for unified collecting and reporting of experimental data in homogeneous and heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis. The community is encouraged to support the future development of this parameter list through an open online repository.

         <title>Sigmatropic [1,5] Carbon Shift of Transient C3 Ammonium Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction path of the Lewis acid catalyzed intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition to form a C3 ammonium enolate is reported by Jan Paradies et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204378). This transient intermediate rearranges diastereospecifically to the tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;one scaffold. The central structure in the picture represents the transition state of the diastereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift which proceeds with retention of configuration on the migrating carbon center.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Epoxidation and Acidic Epoxide Opening of Antibacterial and Antiplasmodial Chlorotonils Yield Highly Potent Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogues of the natural product chlorotonil were obtained by semisynthesis through regio&#8208; and stereoselective epoxidation and subsequent ring opening. The derivatives retained activity against multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum and displayed increased solubility and stability without obvious resistance development. The depicted candidate showed beneficial pharmacokinetics and significant activity in an infection model in mice.







Abstract
The rise of antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to public health. The natural product chlorotonil was identified as a new antibiotic targeting multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens and Plasmodium falciparum. Although chlorotonil shows promising activities, the scaffold is highly lipophilic and displays potential biological instabilities. Therefore, we strived towards improving its pharmaceutical properties by semisynthesis. We demonstrated stereoselective epoxidation of chlorotonils and epoxide ring opening in moderate to good yields providing derivatives with significantly enhanced solubility. Furthermore, in vivo stability of the derivatives was improved while retaining their nanomolar activity against critical human pathogens (e.g. methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and P. falciparum). Intriguingly, we showed further superb activity for the frontrunner molecule in a mouse model of S. aureus infection.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Fluorinated Isochromans via Iodine(I)/Iodine(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral II/IIII catalysis platform is reported to facilitate the fluorocyclization of 2&#8208;vinyl benzaldehydes thereby generating novel fluorinated isochromans in a single operation (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;05 d.r. and 97&#8201;:&#8201;03 e.r.). Not only does the benzylic fluoride shield an oxidatively labile position, X&#8208;ray analyses demonstrate that the [CH2&#8208;CHF] fragment functions as a stereoelectronic mimic of the O&#8208;CH(OR) acetal motif.







Abstract
The success of saturated, fluorinated heterocycles in contemporary drug discovery provides a stimulus for creative endeavor in main group catalysis. Motivated by the ubiquity of isochromans across the bioactive small molecule spectrum, the prominence of the anomeric effect in regulating conformation, and the metabolic lability of the benzylic position, iodine(I)/iodine(III) catalysis has been leveraged for the stereocontrolled generation of selectively fluorinated analogs. To augment the current arsenal of fluorocyclization reactions involving carboxylic acid derivatives, the reaction of readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl benzaldehydes is disclosed (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;05 d.r. and 97&#8201;:&#8201;03 e.r.).

     alt="Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Fluorinated Isochromans via Iodine(I)/Iodine(III) Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral I&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalysis platform is reported to facilitate the fluorocyclization of 2-vinyl benzaldehydes thereby generating novel fluorinated isochromans in a single operation (up to &amp;gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;05 &lt;i&gt;d.r&lt;/i&gt;. and 97&#8201;:&#8201;03 &lt;i&gt;e.r&lt;/i&gt;.). Not only does the benzylic fluoride shield an oxidatively labile position, X-ray analyses demonstrate that the [CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHF] fragment functions as a stereoelectronic mimic of the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-CH(OR) acetal motif.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of saturated, fluorinated heterocycles in contemporary drug discovery provides a stimulus for creative endeavor in main group catalysis. Motivated by the ubiquity of isochromans across the bioactive small molecule spectrum, the prominence of the anomeric effect in regulating conformation, and the metabolic lability of the benzylic position, iodine(I)/iodine(III) catalysis has been leveraged for the stereocontrolled generation of selectively fluorinated analogs. To augment the current arsenal of fluorocyclization reactions involving carboxylic acid derivatives, the reaction of readily accessible 2-vinyl benzaldehydes is disclosed (up to &amp;gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;05 &lt;i&gt;d.r&lt;/i&gt;. and 97&#8201;:&#8201;03 &lt;i&gt;e.r&lt;/i&gt;.). Key stereoelectronic interactions manifest themselves in the X-ray crystal structures of the products, thereby validating the [CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHF] fragment as a stereoelectronic mimic of the [O-CH(OR)] acetal motif.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Self&#8208;assembled architectures for the encapsulation and transport of anions and ion pairs are still rare. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202201831), Max von Delius and co&#8208;workers used the dynamic covalent chemistry of orthoesters in combination with urea&#8208;based diols and triethylene glycol not only for the formation of a chloride cryptate, but also for the simultaneous encapsulation of both ions present in cesium chloride.

         <dc:description>
Sylite, a short, dimerized peptide&#8208;based fluorescent probe, binds gephyrin, a hallmark protein of the inhibitory synapse. As reported by Christian&#8197;G. Specht, Hans&#8197;M. Maric et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202202078), Sylite visualizes inhibitory synapses both in neuron cultures and brain tissue and can be flexibly applied for widefield and confocal 3D volumetric synapse visualization, for brain tissue inhibitory circuits mapping and for super&#8208;resolution imaging of synapses. The cover picture shows a stylized image of a mouse hippocampus in coronal section stained with Sylite in green and DAPI nuclear stain in blue. Cover design by Christian G&#252;nther.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing cathode material integrating good rate performance and sufficient cycle life is the key to commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Hyperstable Zn0.52V2O5&#8208;a&#8729;1.8H2O (ZVOH) cathode with excellent rate performance has been successfully developed via an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;transformation from zinc&#8208;rich Zn3V3O8 (ZVO) in this study. Different from the common synthetic method of additional Zn2+ pre&#8208;insertion, ZVOH &#160;obtained from the insertion of structural H2O and the removal of excess Zn2+ in ZVO, ensuring the lattice structure of ZVOH remains relatively intact during the phase transition and rendering good structural stabilities. The ZVOH delivers reversible capacity of 286.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and161.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1 over 18,000 cycles with retention of 95.4%, demonstrating excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. We also provide new insights on the structural self&#8208;optimization of byproducts&#160; Znx(CF3SO3)y(OH)2x&#8208;y&#183;nH2O and its effect on the mobility of Zn2+ have been revealed by theoretical calculation and experimental evidence.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate</title>

         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO  2  emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. Here, we show a stable and conductive two&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) as an electrocatalyst for reduction of CO  2  to acetate with a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3(2)% at &#8722;0.8 V (  vs  . RHE) and a current density of 12.5 mA cm  &#8722;2  in 0.1 M KHCO  3  solution. No obvious degradation was observed over 80 hours of continuous operation. Combined with comparison of the properties of other catalysts with isolated metal active sites, theoretical calculations and  in&#8208;situ  infrared spectroscopy revealed that the isolated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH  3  with CO  2  to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric chemoselective cross silyl benzoin (Brook&#8208;Benzoin) reaction has been developed. Key steps of this reaction involve activation of the carbon&#8208;silicon bond of an acylsilane by a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to form a silyl acyl anion intermediate. These acyl anions then undergo an addition reaction with indole aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner to afford &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones with excellent optical purities. The reaction mechanism of this cross Brook&#8208;Benzoin reaction was investigated through both experimental and computational methods.

         <title>Phase Transfer&#8208;Mediated Degradation of Ether&#8208;based Localized High&#8208;concentration Electrolytes in Alkali Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) have attracted interest in alkali metal batteries due to the advantages of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on anodes and good chemical/electrochemical stability. Herein, a new degradation mechanism is revealed for ether&#8208;based LHCEs that questions their compatibility with alkali metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). Specifically, the ether solvent reacts with alkali metals to generate solvated electrons (es&#8208;) that attack hydrofluoroether co&#8208;solvents to form a series of byproducts. The ether solvent essentially acts as a phase&#8208;transfer reagent that continuously transfers electrons from solid&#8208;phase metals into the solution phase, thus inhibiting the formation of stable SEI and leading to continuous alkali metal corrosion. Switching to ester&#8208;based solvating solvent or intercalation anodes such as graphite or molybdenum disulfide has been shown to avoid such a degradation mechanism due to the absence of es&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Chain Transfer at High Temperature in Catalytic Olefin Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living polymerization by suppressing chain transfer is a very useful method for achieving precise molecular weight and structure control. However, the suppression of chain transfer at high temperatures is extremely challenging in any catalytic polymerization. This has been a severe limitation for catalytic olefin polymerization, which is one of the most important chemical reactions. Here, we report the unprecedented living polymerization of ethylene at 130 &#176;C with a narrow molecular weight distribution range of 1.04 to 1.08. This is a significant increase in the reaction temperature. Tailor&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts that exhibit both the steric shielding and fluorine effects play an essential role in this breakthrough. These nickel catalysts are even active at 200 &#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150 &#176;C. Mechanistic insights into the key chain transfer reaction are elucidated by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoacoustic&#8208;Fluorescent Imaging Probe for Proteolytic Gingipains Expressed by Porphyromonas gingivalis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone bacteria in periodontal disease, and the gingipain proteases from P. gingivalis are a biomarker of infection. A small&#8208;molecule contrast agent that produces fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in the presence of gingipains is reported. This probe was used with animal models and was further validated with human samples of gingival crevicular fluid.







Abstract
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in periodontal disease. We herein report a dual&#8208;modal fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging probe for the detection of gingipain proteases secreted by P. gingivalis. Upon proteolytic cleavage by Arg&#8208;specific gingipain (RgpB), five&#8208;fold photoacoustic enhancement and &gt;100&#8208;fold fluorescence activation was measured with detection limits of 1.1&#8197;nM RgpB and 5.0E4&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 bacteria in vitro. RgpB activity was imaged in porcine jaws with low&#8208;nanomolar sensitivity. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated in gingival crevicular fluid samples from subjects with and without periodontal disease, wherein activation was correlated to qPCR&#8208;based detection of P. gingivalis (Pearson's r=0.71). Finally, photoacoustic imaging of RgpB&#8208;cleaved probe was achieved in murine brains ex vivo, with relevance and potential utility for disease models of general infection by P. gingivalis, motivated by the recent biological link between gingipain and Alzheimer's disease.

         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins, a reaction that installs both a carbon&#8208;carbon(heteroatom) bond and a carbonyl group across the double bond, is an attractive strategy for alkene functionalization. Herein, we developed a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins with ethers under low CO gas pressure. Using alcohols and amines as the reaction partner, diverse  &#947;  &#8208;oxy substituted esters and amides were produced in good yields with excellent functional group tolerance. Notably, Naftidrofuryl, a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), can be synthesized by this process straightforwardly.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Role of the Cyaphide Ion as a Bridging Ligand in Heterometallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of heterometallic transition metal complexes featuring bridging cyaphide ions (C&#8801;P&#8722;) is reported.. These are synthesized from reactions of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with electron&#8208;rich, nucleophilic transition metal reagents, affording Au(IDipp)(&#956;  2  &#8208;C&#8801;P)Ni(  Me  I  i  Pr)  2  (  Me  I  i  Pr = 1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and Au(IDipp)(&#956;  2  &#8208;C&#8801;P)Rh(Cp*)(PMe  3  ). These studies reveal that, in contrast to the cyanide ion, bimetallic cyaphido complexes strongly favour a &#951;  1  :&#951;  2  coordination mode that maximises the interaction of the second metal (Ni, Rh) with the &#960;&#8208;manifold of the ion (and not the phosphorus atom lone pair). End&#8208;on bridging can be effectively unlocked by blocking the &#960;&#8208;manifold, as demonstrated by reaction of Au(IDipp)(&#956;  2  &#8208;C&#8801;P)Rh(Cp*)(PMe  3  ) with an electrophilic transition metal reagent, W(CO)  5  (THF), which affords the heterotrimetallic compound Au(IDipp)(&#956;  3  &#8208;C&#8801;P)[Rh(Cp*)(PMe  3  )][W(CO)  5  ].</dc:description>

         <title>Medium Diradical Character, Small Hole and Electron Reorganization Energies and Ambipolar Transistors in Difluorenoheteroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four difluorenoheteroles having a central quinoidal core with the heteroring varying as furan, thiophene, its dioxide derivative and pyrrole have shown to be medium character diradicals. Solid&#8208;state structures, optical, photophysical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties have been discussed in terms of diradical character, variation of aromatic character and captodative effects (electron affinity). Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been prepared, showing balanced hole and electron mobilities of the order of 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  /Vs or ambipolar charge transport which is first inferred from their redox amphoterism. Quantum chemical calculations show that the electrical behavior is originated from the medium diradical character which produces similar reorganization energies for hole and electron transport. The vision of a diradical as simultaneously bearing pseudo&#8208;hole and pseudo&#8208;electron defects might justify the reduced values of reorganization energies for both regimes. Structure&#8208;function relationships between diradical and ambipolar electrical behavior are revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Phase Alignment and Interfaces via Polyelectrolytes Anchoring Enables Large&#8208;area 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit improved lifetime while still facing challenges such as phase alignment and up&#8208;scaling to module&#8208;level devices. Herein, polyelectrolytes are explored to tackle this issue. The contact of perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) is important for decreasing interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and scalable fabrication of uniform 2D perovskite film. Through exploring compatible butylamine cation, we first demonstrate poly (3&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl) thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;butylamine (P3CT&#8208;BA) as an efficient HTL for 2D PSCs due to its great hydrophilicity, relatively high hole mobility and uniform surface. More importantly, the tailored P3CT&#8208;BA forms anchoring effect and acts as the buried passivator for 2D perovskites. Consequently, a best efficiency approaching 18% was achieved and we further first report large&#8208;area (2&#215;3 cm  2  , 5&#215;5 cm  2  ) 2D perovskite minimodules with an impressive efficiency of 14.81% and 11.13%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Protein&#8208;Protein Couplings Mediated by Small Molecules under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of protein&#8208;protein couplings under physiological conditions without impact on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of proteins are highly demanding. The combination effect of phenylsulfonyl and aldehyde in 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208;picolinaldehyde (FPPA) results in high reactivity of fluorine for free thiols. In FPPA, the higher reactivity of fluorine than phenylsulfonyl for free thiols, and it leads to the first quantitative nucleophilic substitution and the subsequent reactions either via selective substitution of phenylsulfonyl by an additional thiol or cyclization of aldehyde with a 1, 2&#8208;aminothiol molecule. The FPPA mediated protein&#8208;protein coupling proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, resulting in stable protein conjugates. This coupling method has negligible 3D structural perturbations on the target proteins, and it produces overall intact, nearly traceless and native structural folds of proteins. It is also highly suitable for segmentally isotopic labeling of multi&#8208;domain proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent and Selective Degrader for USP7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and more than half of cancers contain p53 mutations. The development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for p53 mutant cancer therapy is a big challenge and highly desirable. Ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitinating enzyme and proposed to stabilize the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that promotes the proteosomal degradation of p53. Herein, we report the design and characterization of U7D&#8208;1 as the first selective USP7&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC). U7D&#8208;1 showed selective and effective USP7 degradation, and maintained potent cell growth inhibition in p53 mutant cancer cells, with USP7 inhibitor showing no activity. These data clearly demonstrated the practicality and importance of PROTAC as a preliminary chemical tool for investigating USP7 protein functions and a promising method for potential p53 mutant cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with multi&#8208;stimulus response (MSR) properties have demonstrated many potential and practical applications. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;stacked thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material with multi&#8208;stimulus response (MSR) properties, named SDMAC, was designed and synthesized using distorted 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine as a donor. SDMAC possesses a rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked configuration with intramolecular through space interactions and exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE), solvatochromic, piezochromic, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) under different external stimuli. The rigid molecular structure and efficient TADF properties of SDMAC can use in display and lighting. Using SDMAC as an emitter, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is as high as 28.4%, which is the most efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs based on the through&#8208;space charge transfer strategy. The CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Glidomides and Elucidation of Different Mechanisms for Formation of &#946;&#8208;OH Amino Acid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) can incorporate nonproteinogenic amino acids into peptidyl backbones to increase structural diversity. Genome mining of Schlegelella brevitalea led to the identification of a class of linear lipoheptapeptides, glidomides, featuring two unusual residues: threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;His and threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of Asp and His is catalyzed by the nonheme Fe(&#8545;)/a&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent &#946;&#8208;hydroxylases GlmD and GlmF, respectively. GlmD independently catalyzes the hydroxylation of L&#8208;Asp to primarily produce threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;L&#8208;Asp on the thiolation domain, and then undergoes epimerization to form threo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;OH&#8208;D&#8208;Asp in the final products. However, &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of His requires the concerted action of GlmF and the interface (I) domain, a novel condensation domain family clade. The key sites of I domain for interaction with GlmF were identified, suggesting that the mechanism for hydroxylation of His depends on the collaboration between hydroxylase and NRPS.</dc:description>

         <title>Alloy&#8208;type Anodes for High&#8208;performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloy&#8208;type anodes are one of the most promising classes of next&#8208;generation anode materials due to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical capacity (2~10 times that of graphite). However, current alloy&#8208;type anodes have several limitations: a huge volume expansion, a high tendency to fracture and disintegrate, an unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, and low Coulombic efficiency.&#160;Efforts to overcome these challenges are ongoing. This review details recent progress in the research of batteries based on alloy&#8208;type anodes and discusses the direction of their future development. We conclude that improvements in structural design, the introduction of a protective interface, and the selection of suitable electrolytes are the most effective ways to improve the performance of alloy&#8208;type anodes. Furthermore, future studies should direct more attention toward analyzing their synergistic promoting effect.</dc:description>

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Dense, Powerful, Robust Bipolar Zinc&#8211;Ferrocene Redox&#8208;Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust redox&#8208;flow battery is developed using a zinc&#8211;ferrocene bipolar electrolyte. This bipolar zinc&#8211;ferrocene redox&#8208;flow battery outperforms all previously reported aqueous organic redox&#8208;flow batteries (AORFBs) in terms of demonstrated energy density, power density, cycles and duration, and cycling stability.







Abstract
Zinc metal represents a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;capacity anode material to develop energy&#8208;dense aqueous redox&#8208;flow batteries (RFB). However, the energy&#8208;storage applications of traditional inorganic Zn halide flow batteries are primarily plagued by the material challenges of traditional halide cathode electrolytes (e.g., bromine), including corrosion, toxicity, and severe crossover. Herein, we report a bipolar zinc&#8211;ferrocene salt compound, zinc 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;sulfonatopropyl)ferrocene, Zn[Fc(SPr)2] (1.80&#8197;M solubility or 48.2&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722; charge storage capacity)&#8212;a robust, energy&#8208;dense, bipolar redox&#8208;active electrolyte material for RFBs. Zn[Fc(SPr)2]&#8208;based redox&#8208;flow batteries operated at high current densities of up to 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and delivered an energy efficiency of up to 81.5&#8201;% and a power density of up to 270.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A Zn[Fc(SPr)2] flow battery demonstrated an energy density of 20.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 and displayed nearly 100&#8201;% capacity retention for 2000&#8197;cycles (1284&#8197;h or 53.5&#8197;days).

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Ultrasensitive Dynamic Wrinkling on Floating Films Induced by Photo&#8208;Orientation of Azopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During polarized light illumination, a floating azo&#8208;film experiences a wealth of ultrafast wrinkling evolution coupled with unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers that are involved is revealed experimentally for the first time.







Abstract
Ubiquitous surface wrinkling has been well&#8208;studied theoretically and experimentally. How to modulate the stress state of a liquid&#8208;supported system for the unexploited wrinkling capabilities remains a challenge. Here we report a simple linearly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light illumination to spatiotemporally trigger ultrasensitive in situ dynamic wrinkling on a floating azo&#8208;film. The smart combination of the liquid substrate with photoresponsive azo&#8208;moieties leads to the light&#8208;induced ultrafast wrinkling evolution, accompanied by unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The involved different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers is disclosed experimentally for the first time. Meanwhile, programmable dynamic wrinkling with all&#8208;optical switchable surface topographies is available, which has wide application potentials in photoresponsive soft photonics.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones via Oxaziridinium Catalysed ortho&#8208;Hydroxylative Phenol Dearomatization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective, oxaziridinium&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;hydroxylative dearomatization&#8208;[4+2] dimerization reaction of phenols is described. This classically challenging transformation was successfully employed in the synthesis of bis(monoterpenoid) (+)&#8208;biscarvacrol and bacterial metabolite (&#8722;)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;xylenol), with high enantioselectivity. Our simple, organocatalytic system tolerates multiple phenol substitution patterns and ortho substituents.







Abstract
Hydroxylative dearomatization reactions of phenols (HPD) offer an efficient way to assemble complex, biologically relevant scaffolds. Despite this, enantioselective hydroxylative phenol dearomatizations for the construction of bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones are classically limited to stoichiometric chiral reagents, and a practical, enantioselective catalytic method has remained elusive. Herein, we describe a highly enantioselective, organocatalytic tandem o&#8208;HPD&#8208;[4+2] reaction. Our methodology utilizes a chiral oxaziridinium organocatalyst, that is available in both enantiomeric forms, to afford dearomatized products in high enantioselectivity over a range of phenol substitution patterns. This approach was applied to the highly enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;biscarvacrol (99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.) and (&#8722;)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;xylenol) (94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.). The practicality of our conditions was demonstrated at gram&#8208;scale, using an amine precatalyst, accessible in a single synthetic step.

         <title>Sigmatropic [1,5] Carbon Shift of Transient C3 Ammonium Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a new [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangement is described. With the aid of a borane&#8208;based Lewis acid, the transiently generated C3 ammonium enolates undergo a sigmatropic [1,5] shift of benzylic, allylic and propargylic groups to provide access to trans&#8208;configured tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with diastereoselectivity of &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1. The reaction is investigated in kinetic, mechanistic and computational experiments.







Abstract
The stereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift of C3 ammonium enolates is discovered. According to mechanistic, kinetic and computational experiments, this new rearrangement proceeds via the catalytic generation of a transient C3 ammonium enolate by intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition. This intermediate rapidly undergoes [1,5] sigmatropic carbon migration to furnish the respective tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with excellent diastereoselectivities of d.r. &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 and in 61&#8211;98&#8201;% yield.

         <title>From Copper to Basic Copper Carbonate: A Reversible Conversion Cathode in Aqueous Anion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly reversible electrochemical conversion of commercial bulk copper metal to form basic copper carbonate, Cu2CO3(OH)2, from a saturated aqueous electrolyte comprising 4.5&#8201;m K2CO3 and 9&#8201;m KOH, demonstrating high capacity, fast rate capability, and relatively stable cycle life is reported. The salt electrode consisting of Cu, K2CO3, and KOH renders this anion&#8208;hosting electrode a cathode for rocking&#8208;chair batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries that use anions and cations as charge carriers represent a promising energy&#8208;storage technology. However, an uncharted area is to explore transition metals as electrodes to host carbonate in conversion reactions. Here we report the reversible conversion reaction from copper to Cu2CO3(OH)2, where the copper electrode comprising K2CO3 and KOH solid is self&#8208;sufficient with anion&#8208;charge carriers. This electrode dissociates and associates K+ ions during battery charge and discharge. The copper active mass and the anion&#8208;bearing cathode exhibit a reversible capacity of 664&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 299&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, and relatively stable cycling in a saturated mixture electrolyte of K2CO3 and KOH. The results open an avenue to use carbonate as a charge carrier for batteries to serve for the consumption and storage of CO2.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Sequential Hydroboration/Isomerization/Hydroboration of 2&#8208;Aryl Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) were synthesized via an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydroboration/isomerization/hydroboration of vinylcyclopropanes through a trisubstituted alkene intermediate. These chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) were further converted into chiral 1,2,5&#8208;triaryl alkanes by an iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction with aryl halides.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric sequential hydroboration/isomerization/hydroboration of 2&#8208;aryl vinylcyclopropanes was for the first time reported for the preparation of valuable chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity via asymmetric sequential isomerization/hydroboration of a trisubstituted alkene intermediate. The reaction was carried out smoothly and this protocol was used for asymmetric syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;preclamol in gram&#8208;scale. The two primary C(sp3)&#8722;B bonds in chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) could be distinguished in iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, delivering chiral 1,2,5&#8208;triaryl alkanes with excellent enantioselectivity. Based on experimental and computational studies, a cobalt&#8208;hydride species was proposed as the active intermediate in hydroboration, isomerization, and second hydroboration reactions.

Four ketoreductases (KREDs) were identified for the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides. KRED311 and KRED349 catalyse the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;O bond with opposite absolute configurations via chemoenzymatic cascades from thiophenols/thiols and &#945;&#8208;haloketones/alcohols. KRED253 and KRED384 catalyse the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;S bond with opposite enantioselectivities by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic &#945;&#8208;thioaldehydes.







Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides are an important class of organic compounds which find broad application in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry.

         <title>&#8220;Sandwich&#8221; Diimine&#8208;Copper Catalysts for C&#8722;H Functionalization by Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst platform for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization has been discovered. &#8220;Sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper(I) complexes catalyze reactions of alkane, ether, and amine C&#8722;H bonds with a large panel of diazo compounds. Additionally, the first metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation by CH2N2 is disclosed. The electrophilicity and extreme steric bulk of these catalysts are likely reasons for their efficiency.







Abstract
We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper(I) catalysts for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl&#8208;diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp3)&#8722;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, aryldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base&#8208;metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazo compounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;A new catalyst platform for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond functionalization has been discovered. &#8220;Sandwich&#8221; diimine-copper(I) complexes catalyze reactions of alkane, ether, and amine C&#8722;H bonds with a large panel of diazo compounds. Additionally, the first metal-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H methylation by CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is disclosed. The electrophilicity and extreme steric bulk of these catalysts are likely reasons for their efficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine-copper(I) catalysts for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl-diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, aryldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base-metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazo compounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;-copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Double Remote C(sp2)&#8722;H / C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations by Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via radical relay have been accomplished by mild visible&#8208;light photocatalysis without an exogenous photocatalyst, featuring meta&#8208;arene and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) functionalizations with a single catalyst.







Abstract
Distal C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations have recently emerged as step&#8208;economical tools for molecular synthesis. However, while the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) construction is of fundamental importance, its formation through double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has proven elusive. By merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization with an aliphatic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, we, herein, describe the catalyzed twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via photo&#8208;induced ruthenium&#8208;mediated radical relay. Thus, meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H arene bonds and remote C(sp3)&#8722;H alkane bonds were activated by a single catalyst in a single operation. This process was accomplished at room temperature by visible light&#8212;notably without exogenous photocatalysts. Experimental and computational theory studies uncovered a manifold comprising ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H activation, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET), 1,n&#8208;HAT (n=5&#8211;7) and &#963;&#8208;activation by means of a single ruthenium(II) catalyst.

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Tunicamycin&#8197;V and Discovery of a Cytostatic DPAGT1 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#252;chner&#8211;Curtius&#8211;Schlotterbeck&#8208;type reaction enabled the total synthesis of tunicamycin&#8197;V (TN&#8208;V), a nonselective phosphotransferase inhibitor, in just 15 steps from D&#8208;galactal in 21&#8201;% overall yield. The short and high&#8208;yielding synthetic route was also adapted for the synthesis of analogues, thus leading to the discovery of a novel cytostatic tunicamycin analogue, TN&#8208;TMPA, with high DPAGT1 selectivity.







Abstract
A short total synthesis of tunicamycin&#8197;V (1), a non&#8208;selective phosphotransferase inhibitor, is achieved via a B&#252;chner&#8211;Curtius&#8211;Schlotterbeck type reaction. Tunicamycin&#8197;V can be synthesized in 15 chemical steps from D&#8208;galactal with 21&#8201;% overall yield. The established synthetic scheme is operationally very simple and flexible to introduce building blocks of interest. The inhibitory activity of one of the designed analogues 28 against human dolichyl&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1) is 12.5&#8197;times greater than 1. While tunicamycins are cytotoxic molecules with a low selectivity, the novel analogue 28 displays selective cytostatic activity against breast cancer cell lines including a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

         <title>PIII&#8208;Directed Late&#8208;Stage Ligation and Macrocyclization of Peptides with Olefins by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C7&#8208;selective alkylation of tryptophan residues has been developed. This method is compatible with internal olefins and represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8722;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation is a step&#8208;economical strategy for peptide functionalization. Herein, we report the method of late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of tryptophan residues at the C7 position. This method utilizes a N&#8208;PtBu2 directing group and tolerates various peptide and alkene substrates. Utilizing internal olefins, this study represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8722;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization. Furthermore, our method provides access to peptide macrocycles with unique Trp(C7)&#8208;alkyl crosslinks and potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Geminal Hydroborative Cyclization of Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the previously known hydroborative cyclizations that add hydrogen and boron to opposite sides of an enyne, the proper choice of a ruthenium catalyst alters this propensity to a new addition mode, geminal hydroborative cyclopropanation. Two possible mechanisms are operative, which are substrate&#8208;dependent based on DFT studies.







Abstract
Disclosed here is the first geminal (gem&#8208;) hydroborative cyclization of enynes. Different from known hydroborative cyclizations, this process adds hydrogen and boron to the same position, leading to a new reaction mode. With [Cp*RuCl]4 as catalyst, a range of gem&#8208;hydroborated bicyclic products bearing a cyclopropane unit could be rapidly assembled from simple enyne substrates. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the reaction mechanism. Notably, two major competing pathways may operate with substrate&#8208;dependence. 1,6&#8208;Enynes favor initial oxidative cyclometalation to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate prior to engaging hydroborane, while other enynes (e.g., 1,7&#8208;enynes) that lack strong propensity toward cyclization prefer initial alkyne gem&#8208;(H,B)&#8208;addition to form an &#945;&#8208;boryl ruthenium carbene followed by intramolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This process also represents the first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enyne hydroborative cyclization.

         <title>Growth of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Assemblies on Cu(100) and Cu(111): From Single Molecules to Magic&#8208;Number Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adsorbs on Cu(100) and Cu(111) leading to different nanostructures. On Cu(111), the combination of intermolecular interactions and commensurability promotes the formation of magic&#8208;number islands. The understanding of this self&#8208;assembly process represents important progress for the design of tailormade N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) assemblies.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have superior properties as building blocks of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs). Understanding the influence of the substrate in the molecular arrangement is a fundamental step before employing these ligands in technological applications. Herein, we study the molecular arrangement of a model NHC on Cu(100) and Cu(111). While mostly disordered phases appear on Cu(100), on Cu(111) well&#8208;defined structures are formed, evolving from magic&#8208;number islands to molecular ribbons with coverage. This work presents the first example of magic&#8208;number islands formed by NHC assemblies on flat surfaces. Diffusion and commensurability are key factors explaining the observed arrangements. These results shed light on the molecule&#8208;substrate interaction and open the possibility of tuning nanopatterned structures based on NHC assemblies.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture at Nucleophilic Hydroxide Sites in Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon capture and sequestration is needed to fight global climate change, but current technologies are largely limited to sorbents based on oxidatively sensitive amines. Hydroxides encapsulated within cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks are demonstrated to capture CO2 via reversible bicarbonate formation, leading to a promising oxidatively stable class of materials for CO2 capture from industrial point sources.







Abstract
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from industrial point sources and direct air capture are necessary to combat global climate change. A particular challenge faced by amine&#8208;based sorbents&#8212;the current leading technology&#8212;is poor stability towards O2. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 chemisorption in &#947;&#8208;cylodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CD&#8208;MOFs) occurs via HCO3&#8722; formation at nucleophilic OH&#8722; sites within the framework pores, rather than via previously proposed pathways. The new framework KHCO3 CD&#8208;MOF possesses rapid and high&#8208;capacity CO2 uptake, good thermal, oxidative, and cycling stabilities, and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions. Because of its low cost and performance under realistic conditions, KHCO3 CD&#8208;MOF is a promising new platform for CCS. More broadly, our work demonstrates that the encapsulation of reactive OH&#8722; sites within a porous framework represents a potentially general strategy for the design of oxidation&#8208;resistant adsorbents for CO2 capture.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Arene C(sp2)&#8722;H Amidations under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical approach towards 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;quinolinones by catalysis with FeBr3 has been developed. The solvent&#8208;free processes start from readily available dioxazolones, which undergo intramolecular amidation reactions providing the products in good to very high yields. Practically, the reactions are easy to perform, proceed within a short period of time and require only standard ball milling equipment.







Abstract
In a ball mill, FeBr3&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular amidations lead to 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;quinolinones in good to almost quantitative yields. The reactions do not require a solvent and are easy to perform. No additional ligand is needed for the iron catalyst. Both 4&#8208;substituted aryl and &#946;&#8208;substituted dioxazolones provide products with high selectivity. Mechanistically, an electrophilic spirocyclization followed by C&#8722;C migration explains the formation of rearranged products.

         <title>Combinatorial Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Cages with Systematically Fine&#8208;Tuned Cavities for Efficient Co&#8208;Encapsulation and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combinatorial self&#8208;assembly approach gives rise to a family of palladium&#8208;organic cages featuring systematically fine&#8208;tuned shapes and cavities. Emergent guest&#8208;binding and catalytic functions were observed that are due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages.







Abstract
Controllable arrangement of different ligands in a single assembly will not only bring increased complexity but also offers a new route to fine&#8208;tune the function of the designed architecture. We report here a combinatorial self&#8208;assembly with enPd(NO3)2 and three different ligands (L1&#8211;3), which gave rise to a family of six palladium&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;6) with systematically varied shapes and cavities, including three new heteroleptic (Pd5L12L2, Pd5L12L3, Pd4L2L3), one new homoleptic (Pd4L32) cages, and two known homoleptic (Pd6L14, Pd4L22) cages. Emergent functions due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages have been observed: the heteroleptic cages can form ternary complexes by co&#8208;encapsulation of both aromatic and aliphatic guests, while their homoleptic counterparts can only form binary complexes. Such a forced co&#8208;encapsulation effect endows the heteroleptic cages with enhanced catalytic power for the Knoevenagel condensation.

         <title>Enhancing the Release Efficiency of Molecular Chemotherapeutic Prodrug by Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;specific, hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs have been developed to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. However, the release efficiency of hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs is restricted by the degree of tumor hypoxia, which further leads to poor cancer treatment effects. On the other hand, oxygen is consumed gradually in photodynamic therapy (PDT), which aggravates hypoxia at the tumor site. In this study, we combined hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs with PDT agents to promote the prodrugs release, thereby improving their bioavailability and therapeutic effects. As a proof of concept, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized. It can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further discharge drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed in this paper provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug release and real&#8208;time monitoring prodrug release.</dc:description>

         <title>Property&#8208;Driven Development of Passively Permeable Macrocyclic Scaffolds using Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passive membrane permeability is a fundamental challenge in the development of bioactive macrocycles. To achieve this objective, chemists have resorted to various strategies, the most common of which is deployment of  N  &#8208;methylated amino acids and/or D&#8208;amino acids. Here we investigate the effect of heterocyclic grafts on the passive membrane permeability of macrocycles and report the structural consequences of iterative amino acid replacement by azole rings. Through stepwise substitution of amino acid residues for heterocycles, we show that lipophilicity and PAMPA permeability of a macrocycle can be vastly improved. Overall, changes in permeability do not scale linearly as more heterocycles are incorporated, underscoring the subtleties of conformation&#8208;property relationships in this class of molecule. NMR analysis and molecular dynamics simulations provide insights into the structural consequences of the added heterocycles and can now be applied as macrocyclic scaffolds for drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen isotope separation using a metal&#8208;organic cage built from macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials that contain ultrafine pore apertures can separate hydrogen isotopes via kinetic quantum sieving (KQS). However, it is challenging to design materials with suitably narrow pores for KQS that also show good adsorption capacities and operate at practical temperatures. Here, we investigate a metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) assembled from organic macrocycles and Zn(II) ions that exhibits narrow windows (&lt;3.0 &#197;). Two polymorphs, referred to as  2&#945;  and  2&#946;  , were observed. Both polymorphs exhibit D  2  / H  2  selectivity in the temperature range 30&#8211;100 K. At higher temperature (77 K), the D  2  adsorption capacity of  2&#946;  increases to about 2.7 times that of  2&#945;  , along with a reasonable D  2  / H  2  selectivity. Gas sorption analysis and thermal desorption spectroscopy suggest a gate&#8208;opening effect of the MOCs pore aperture. This promotes KQS at temperatures above liquid nitrogen temperature, indicating that MOCs holds promise for hydrogen isotope separation in real industrial environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Gradient&#8208;Driven Sensitivity Enhancement of Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Supramolecular Chemosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An overarching challenge in the development of supramolecular sensor systems is to enhance their sensitivity, which commonly involves the synthesis of refined receptors with increased affinity to the analyte. We show that a dramatic sensitivity increase by 1&#8208;2 orders of magnitude can be achieved by encapsulating supramolecular chemosensors inside liposomes and exposing them to a pH gradient across the lipid bilayer membrane. This causes an imbalance of the influx and efflux rates of basic and acidic analytes leading to a significantly increased concentration of the analyte in the liposome interior. The utility of our liposome&#8208;enhanced sensors was demonstrated with various host&#8208;dye reporter pairs and sensing mechanisms, and we could easily increase the sensitivity towards multiple biologically relevant analytes, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and tryptamine.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Ca2+ Nanomodulators Activate Pyroptosis through Mitochondrial Ca2+ Overload for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroptosis provides a new direction and broad prospects for cancer immunotherapy. However, the development of nanoplatform as pyroptosis inducers is limited, the discovery of a new type of nano&#8208;pyroptosis inducer for cancer immunotherapy is still imminent. Herein, the biodegradable  Ca  2+  nanomodulators  (CaNMs) are prepared as pyroptosis inducers for cancer immunotherapy  via mitochondrial Ca  2+  overload  . The obtained CaNMs can decompose under low pH to release Ca  2+  and curcumin, leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca  2+  ions&#65292;eventually resulting in pyroptosis.  We not only confirm the happening of mitochondrial Ca  2+  overload&#8208;triggered pyroptosis for the first time but also reveal the  robust immune responses via CaNMs, along with remarkably suppressing tumor proliferation and lung metastasis. This work will provide new strategies and inspirations for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cancer treatments, greatly contributing to the further development of Ca  2+  nanomodulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Crystals with Competing Intermolecular Interactions: In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction and Luminescent Features Reveal Multimolecular Assembly of Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry under mechanochemical conditions has drawn attention because it can induce low&#8208;solubility molecules to self&#8208;assemble, although most of the reported examples have been limited to two&#8208;component systems. We applied mechanochemical synthesis to achieve multimolecular self&#8208;assembly in more challenging three&#8208;component systems. The produced crystals showed multicolor solid&#8208;state luminescence depending on the components when exposed to UV light.&#160; Optical outputs and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were used to examine the self&#8208;assembling behavior in greater depth. Using synchrotron radiation, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction permitted direct observation of the milling process, which started the self&#8208;assembly process within 1 min. This research emphasizes the importance of multicomponent molecules with optical functions and self&#8208;assembling behavior and offers the possibility of developing more complicated multicomponent crystals and organic solid solutions for advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Biostable l&#8208;DNA Hydrogel with Improved Stability for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An l&#8208;DNA hydrogel is reported with the outstanding shear&#8208;thinning, self&#8208;healing and thermal&#8208;responsiveness properties of d&#8208;DNA hydrogels based on the same network topology and supramolecular interactions. Additionally, with the mirror&#8208;isomer deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited excellent biostability and stimulated low inflammation. These advances will greatly promote the feasibility of real&#8208;world applications.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels have attracted increasing attention owing to their excellent permeability and high mechanical strength, together with thixotropy, versatile programmability and good biocompatibility. However, the moderate biostability and immune stimulation of DNA have arisen as big concerns for future potential clinical applications. Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of a novel l&#8208;DNA hydrogel, which inherited the extraordinary physical properties of a d&#8208;DNA hydrogel. With the mirror&#8208;isomer deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited improved biostability, withstanding fetal bovine serum (FBS) for at least 1&#8197;month without evident decay of its mechanical properties. The low inflammatory response of the l&#8208;DNA hydrogel has been verified both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, this l&#8208;DNA hydrogel with outstanding biostability and biocompatibility can be anticipated to serve as an ideal 3D cell&#8208;culture matrix and implanted bio&#8208;scaffold for long&#8208;term biomedical applications.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer Driven Enantioselective Minisci Reaction of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective Minisci reaction between pyridines and prochiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals has been developed. Hydrogen atom transfer is used to generate the latter from simple alcohols and the reaction formally constitutes the couple of two C&#8722;H bonds to form a new C&#8722;C bond in a process that is highly enantioselective and regioselective. Computational studies provide insight into the origins of selectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective Minisci reactions have recently been developed but all instances so far utilize &#945;&#8208;amino radical coupling partners. We report a substantial evolution of the enantioselective Minisci reaction that enables &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals to be used, providing valuable enantioenriched secondary alcohol products. This is achieved through the direct oxidative coupling of two C&#8722;H bonds on simple alcohol and pyridine partners through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;driven approach: a challenging process to achieve due to the numerous side reactions that can occur. Our approach is highly regioselective as well as highly enantioselective. Dicumyl peroxide, upon irradiation with 390&#8197;nm light, serves as both HAT reagent and oxidant whilst selectivity is controlled by use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. Computational and experimental evidence provide mechanistic insight as to the origin of selectivity, revealing a stereodetermining deprotonation step distinct from the analogous reaction of amide&#8208;containing substrates.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Passivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslinked and compact membrane is constructed throughout the perovskite film by a self&#8208;assembly strategy based on cholesterol&#8208;based molecules. This enables durable passivation against harsh conditions and effective defects passivation from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The modified planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit a 23.34&#8201;% champion efficiency and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Defect passivation via post&#8208;treatment of perovskite films is an effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the passivation durability is still an issue due to the weak and vulnerable bonding between passivating functional groups and perovskite defect sites. Here we propose a cholesterol derivative self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct crosslinked and compact membranes throughout perovskite films. These supramolecular membranes act as a robust protection layer against harsh operational conditions while providing effective passivation of defects from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The resultant PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 23.34&#8201;% with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.164&#8197;eV. The unencapsulated devices retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 1600&#8197;h of storage under ambient conditions, and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h in a nitrogen atmosphere, showing significantly improved stability.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Monooxygenation of Phenols: Evidence for a Mononuclear Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI complexes with different ligands (CH3CN, oDFB, NEt3) and counterions of varying coordination ability (BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, Al(OC(CF3)3)4&#8722;) catalyze the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. Detailed mechanistic research shows that this reaction follows a mononuclear pathway, in contrast to the dinuclear mechanism of the enzyme tyrosinase.







Abstract
The CuI salts [Cu(CH3CN)4]PF and [Cu(oDFB)2]PF with the very weakly coordinating anion Al(OC(CF3)3)4&#8722; (PF) as well as [Cu(NEt3)2]PF comprising the unique, linear bis&#8208;triethylamine complex [Cu(NEt3)2]+ were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. The activities of these CuI salts towards monooxygenation of 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (DTBP&#8208;H) were compared to those of [Cu(CH3CN)4]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions (BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, PF6&#8722;), revealing an anion effect on the activity of the catalyst and a ligand effect on the reaction rate. The reaction is drastically accelerated by employing CuII&#8208;semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a CuII complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This result and other experimental observations show that with these systems the oxygenation of monophenols does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.

         <dc:description>
Using an (o&#8208;carboranyl)diphosphine ligand, &#945;&#8208;CF3 gold(I) carbenes were isolated and fully characterized. Their stabilization involves Au&#8208;to&#8208;Ccarb backdonation and arene&#8208;to&#8208;Ccarb &#960;&#8208;donation. They readily engage in carbene&#8208;type transformations under both stoichiometric and catalytic conditions.







Abstract
Aryl trifluoromethyl diazomethanes 2&#8208;R (R=Ph, OMe, CF3) are readily decomposed by the (o&#8208;carboranyl)diphosphine gold(I) complex 1. The resulting &#945;&#8208;CF3 substituted carbene complexes 3&#8208;R have been characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography (for 3&#8208;Ph). The bonding situation was thoroughly assessed by computational means, showing stabilization of the electrophilic carbene center by &#960;&#8208;donation from the aryl substituent and backdonation from Au, as enhanced by the chelating P^P ligand. Reactivity studies under stoichiometric and catalytic conditions substantiate typical carbene&#8208;type behavior for 3&#8208;Ph.

         <title>Bifunctionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Pore&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Enantioselective Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porosity is fundamental in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) but has always been underestimated for luminescent sensing applications. A simple and general synthetic strategy was developed for isoreticular MOFs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes, which revealed the fundamentals of the pore effect in luminescent sensors.







Abstract
Porosity is a fundamental property of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the role of the pore size has always been underestimated in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors for enantioselective sensing. The construction of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs) with variable pore sizes and the synergy between chirality and luminescence is challenging.

&lt;p&gt;Porosity is fundamental in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) but has always been underestimated for luminescent sensing applications. A simple and general synthetic strategy was developed for isoreticular MOFs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes, which revealed the fundamentals of the pore effect in luminescent sensors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porosity is a fundamental property of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the role of the pore size has always been underestimated in MOF-based luminescent sensors for enantioselective sensing. The construction of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs) with variable pore sizes and the synergy between chirality and luminescence is challenging. Herein, a general strategy was developed to introduce chirality into two well-known IRMOF-74 analogs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes by functionalizing the open metal site under mild conditions. To enhance the detection accuracy, a second luminescent center was introduced into the IRMOF-74 system to achieve ratiometric sensing. The two bifunctionalized IRMOF-74 compounds exhibited pore-size-dependent sensing performance for enantiomers. This study not only provides a convenient method to construct chiral MOFs as advanced sensing materials but also reveals the fundamental of the pores in MOF-based luminescent sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allenyl Alcohols by Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential C&#8722;H Bond Addition to 1,3&#8208;Enynes and Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and stereoselective Co&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component synthesis of allenyl alcohols is reported. This method introduces two C&#8722;C &#963; bonds through C&#8722;H bond activation and sequential addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes and a wide range of aldehydes. A plausible mechanism and further transformations are disclosed.







Abstract
An efficient and stereoselective CoIII&#8208;catalyzed sequential C&#8722;H bond addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes and aldehydes is disclosed. This transformation represents the first example of sequential C&#8722;H bond additions to 1,3&#8208;enynes and a second coupling partner and provides the first example of preparing allenes by C&#8722;H bond addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes. A wide range of aldehydes, C&#8722;H bond substrates and 1,3&#8208;enynes with large substituents on the alkynes are effective substrates. The allenyl alcohol products can be further converted to dihydrofurans with high stereoselectivity either in situ or under Ag&#8208;mediated cyclization conditions. The allenyl silyl group can also be transferred to the adjacent alcohol by a Brook rearrangement. Moreover, a mechanism for the transformation is proposed supported by X&#8208;ray structural characterization of a cobaltacycle intermediate.

         <title>In Situ Hydrolysis of Block Copolymers at the Water&#8208;Oil Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time pendant drop tensiometry of a toluene solution of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) in water was measured to monitor the conversion of PSM blocks into glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) blocks upon the addition of acid to the aqueous phase. This work provides opportunities to quantitatively monitor responsive block copolymers for structuring liquids.







Abstract
In situ manipulation of the chemical composition of block copolymers at the fluid interfaces affords a route by which the interfacial tension, the packing of the copolymers, and the penetration of the blocks into the two liquids can be controlled. Here, a series of linear block copolymers of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) are used, converting hydrophobic PSM block into a hydrophilic glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) block, that results in a marked decrease in the liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension. The kinetics of the first&#8208;order hydrolysis reaction was analyzed by monitoring the time&#8208;dependent interfacial tension as a function of pH, polymer concentration, molecular weight, and composition. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to measure the in&#8208;plane dynamics of the copolymers before and after hydrolysis. This work provides insights into a quantitative pathway by which in situ interfacial reactions may be performed and monitored in real time, completely changing the interfacial activity of the molecule.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks via Asymmetric Organocatalysis for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and general organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for the chiral covalent organic framework (CCOF) synthesis under ambient conditions is presented. The metalated CCOF can be further shaped into a fixed&#8208;bed reactor by incorporation with ecofriendly and low&#8208;cost chitosan to realize the scaled&#8208;up catalytic asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reaction in a green and facile way.







Abstract
A general and efficient organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for the synthesis of chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) has been developed. With a chiral 2&#8208;methylpyrrolidine catalyst, a series of tris(N&#8208;salicylideneamine)&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs are directly constructed from prochiral aldehyde&#8208; and primary amine&#8208;monomers. The adopted aminocatalytic asymmetric Schiff&#8208;base condensation herein is performed under ambient conditions with clear green synthetic advantages over the conventional acid&#8208;catalysed solvothermal methods. The obtained &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs can be further metalated by a solid&#8208;state coordination approach, and the resulting CuII@CCOFs can highly promote an asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, a CuII@CCOF@chitosan aerogel was fabricated as a highly efficient fixed&#8208;bed model reactor for scaled&#8208;up catalysis. The concept of aminocatalytic asymmetric polymerization might open a new way for constructing the CCOFs via asymmetric organocatalysis.

Abstract
An unprecedented highly enantioselective Ru&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;keto amides with ammonium salts has been disclosed, efficiently offering valuable enantioenriched N&#8208;unprotected unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives bearing a broad range of aryl or alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents. This protocol features easily accessible substrates, good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent enantiocontrol, making it a good complementary approach to the known methods. Moreover, this method is also applicable to the preparation of N&#8208;unprotected unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives containing an additional stereogenic center at the &#946;&#8208;position through a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process.

         <title>(PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6: A Robust Tetravalent Phosphaza&#8208;adamantane Scaffold for Molecular and Macromolecular Construction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new air&#8208;stable and thermally robust tetrahedral tetravalent inorganic cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 has been achieved. This cage allows four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions on its periphery to give unprecedented molecular and macromolecular constructs. This utility is shown by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion and the first all P/N polyphazene network material.







Abstract
Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are important rigid covalent connectors that play a four&#8208;way scaffolding role in molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a new tetravalent phosphaza&#8208;adamantane cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 (2), that shows high thermal, air, and redox stability due to its geometry. It nevertheless participates in covalent four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions along its periphery. The combination of a robust core and reactive corona makes 2 a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be constructed. This potential is demonstrated by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion (in compound 3) and the first all P/N poly(phosphazene) network (5).

         <title>Cold Denaturation of Proteins in the Absence of Solvent: Implications for Protein Storage
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>

Don't put your protein in the &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C freezer: a well&#8208;known fact for biochemists and here it is demonstrated why this is right even in a vacuum. Variable&#8208;temperature ion mobility allows measurement of the structure of isolated proteins at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. For three isotypes of monoclonal antibody, it is found that there is substantial structural rearrangement at 250&#8197;K (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C), indicating a cold denaturation transition. At deep&#8208;freezing temperatures (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) the structure is unaffected.







Abstract
The effect of temperature on the stability of proteins is well explored above 298&#8197;K, but harder to track experimentally below 273&#8197;K. Variable&#8208;temperature ion mobility mass spectrometry (VT IM&#8208;MS) allows us to measure the structure of molecules at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. Here we monitor conformational changes that occur to two isotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on cooling by measuring their collision cross sections (CCS) at discrete drift gas temperatures from 295 to 160&#8197;K. The CCS at 250&#8197;K is larger than predicted from collisional theory and experimental data at 295&#8197;K. This restructure is attributed to change in the strength of stabilizing intermolecular interactions. Below 250&#8197;K the CCS of the mAbs increases in line with prediction implying no rearrangement. Comparing data from isotypes suggest disulfide bridging influences thermal structural rearrangement. These findings indicate that in vacuo deep&#8208;freezing minimizes denaturation and maintains the native fold and VT IM&#8208;MS measurements at sub ambient temperatures provide new insights to the phenomenon of cold denaturation.

         <title>Guided Synthesis of a Mo/Zn Dual Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Synergistic Effect and Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis strategy for a dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme has been developed by using a macroscopic polymer aerogel as the supporting substrate and supramolecular coordination complexes/polyoxometalates as the metal precursor. The nanozyme with high catalytic activity and super&#8208;long stability has been applied in the detection of various analytes including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages.







Abstract
We present a facile route towards a dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme composed of Zn and Mo, which utilizes the non&#8208;covalent nano&#8208;assembly of polyoxometalates, supramolecular coordination complexes as the metal&#8208;atom precursor, and a macroscopic amphiphilic aerogel as the supporting substrate. The dual single&#8208;atoms of Zn and Mo have a high content (1.5 and 7.3&#8197;wt%, respectively) and exhibit a synergistic effect and a peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The Zn/Mo site was identified as the main active center by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation. The detection of versatile analytes, including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages was achieved. The nanozyme has an outstanding stability and maintained its performance after one year's storage. This study develops a new peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and provides a robust synthetic strategy for single&#8208;atom catalysts by utilizing an aerogel as a facile substrate that is capable of stabilizing various metal atoms.

         <title>Rational Design of a Novel Tubulin Inhibitor with a Unique Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antitubulin drugs are used very successfully in chemotherapy but their chemical structures are complex. Based on a previously performed crystallographic fragment screen, we here rationally designed the small molecule tubulin inhibitor Todalam. The compound displays a unique molecular mechanism of action by targeting a novel binding site in tubulin.







Abstract
In this study, we capitalized on our previously performed crystallographic fragment screen and developed the antitubulin small molecule Todalam with only two rounds of straightforward chemical synthesis. Todalam binds to a novel tubulin site, disrupts microtubule networks in cells, arrests cells in G2/M, induces cell death, and synergizes with vinblastine. The compound destabilizes microtubules by acting as a molecular plug that sterically inhibits the curved&#8208;to&#8208;straight conformational switch in the &#945;&#8208;tubulin subunit, and by sequestering tubulin dimers into assembly incompetent oligomers. Our results describe for the first time the generation of a fully rationally designed small molecule tubulin inhibitor from a fragment, which displays a unique molecular mechanism of action. They thus demonstrate the usefulness of tubulin&#8208;binding fragments as valuable starting points for innovative antitubulin drug and chemical probe discovery campaigns.

         <title>Mesoionic Imines (MIIs): Strong Donors and Versatile Ligands for Transition Metals and Main Group Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational data disclose an interesting view on the reactivity of mesoionic imines (MIIs), whose versatile synthesis and coordination behavior are reported herein. MIIs appear to be stronger donors compared to their NHI&#8208;congeners and exhibit unique properties like fluorine specific interaction or C&#8722;H&#8208;activation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and the reactivity of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine type mesoionic imines (MIIs). The MIIs are accessible by a base&#8208;mediated cycloaddition between a substituted acetonitrile and an aromatic azide, methylation by established routes and subsequent deprotonation. C=O&#8208;stretching frequencies in MII&#8722;CO2 and &#8722;Rh(CO)2Cl complexes were used to determine the overall donor strength. The MIIs are stronger donors than the N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs). MIIs are excellent ligands for main group elements and transition metals in which they display substituent&#8208;induced fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and undergo C&#8722;H activation. DFT calculations gave insights into the frontier orbitals of the MIIs. The calculations predict a relatively small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap compared to other related ligands. MIIs are potentially able to act as both &#960;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ligands. This report highlights the potential of MIIs to display exciting properties with a huge potential for future development.

MIIs are potentially able to act as both &#960;-donor and &#960;-acceptor ligands. This report highlights the potential of MIIs to display exciting properties with a huge potential for future development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activated, Chemiluminescent Siderophore&#8208;Dioxetane Probes Enable the Selective and Highly Sensitive Detection of Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. The conjugation of bacteria&#8208;specific, uptake&#8208;enhancing siderophore vectors with enzyme&#8208;inducible chemiluminescent dioxetanes enabled the broad&#8208;spectrum detection of &#8220;ESKAPE&#8221; pathogens. The probes displayed a high sensitivity in human plasma and also detected intracellular Gram&#8208;positive and &#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
The sensitive detection of bacterial infections is a prerequisite for their successful treatment. The use of a chemiluminescent readout was so far hampered by an insufficient probe enrichment at the pathogens. We coupled siderophore moieties, that harness the unique iron transport system of bacteria, with enzyme&#8208;activatable dioxetanes and obtained seven trifunctional probes with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios (S/B=426&#8208;859). Conjugates with efficient iron transport capability into bacteria were identified through a growth recovery assay. All ESKAPE pathogens were labelled brightly by desferrioxamine conjugates, while catechols were weaker due to self&#8208;quenching. Bacteria could also be detected inside lung epithelial cells. The best probe 8 detected 9.1&#215;103&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 of S. aureus and 5.0&#215;104&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 of P. aeruginosa, while the analogous fluorescent probe 10 was 205&#8211;305fold less sensitive. This qualifies siderophore dioxetane probes for the selective and sensitive detection of bacteria.

         <title>Heterocyclic Conjugated Polymer Nanoarchitectonics with Synergistic Redox&#8208;Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Aluminium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic C=O/C=N redox centre strategy has been demonstrated to realise high&#8208;performance Al&#8211;organic batteries using a heteroatom &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer cathode in a low&#8208;cost AlCl3/urea electrolyte. The fused C=N sites in the polymer not only contribute good &#960;&#8208;conjugation but also assist neighbouring C=O to uptake four AlCl2(urea)2+ per repeating unit, enabling batteries with high capacity, long cyclability, and high energy density.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective and long&#8208;life rechargeable aluminium ion batteries (AIBs) shows promising prospects for sustainable energy storage applications. Here, we report a heteroatom &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer featuring synergistic C=O and C=N active centres as a new cathode material in AIBs using a low&#8208;cost AlCl3/urea electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the fused C=N sites in the polymer not only benefit good &#960;&#8208;conjugation but also enhance the redox reactivity of C=O sites, which enables the polymer to accommodate four AlCl2(urea)2+ per repeating unit. By integrating the polymer with carbon nanotubes, the hybrid cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity and a long cycle life (295&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 85&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 4000&#8197;cycles). The achieved specific energy density of 413&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 outperforms most Al&#8211;organic batteries reported to date. The synergistic redox&#8208;active sites strategy sheds light on the rational design of organic electrode materials.

Ni&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;controlled tunable cyclization/cross&#8208;couplings was developed for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the formation of 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3&#8208;e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the formation of 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;3&#8208;ones.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;directed divergent synthesis can transform common starting materials into distinct molecular scaffolds by simple tuning different ligands. This strategy enables the rapid construction of structurally rich collection of small molecules for biological evaluation and reveals novel modes of catalytic transformation, representing one of the most sought&#8208;after challenges in synthetic chemistry. We herein report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;controlled tunable cyclization/cross&#8208;couplings for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the nucleophilic addition of the aryl halides to the amide carbonyl, followed by 1,4&#8208;acyl transfer and cross&#8208;coupling to obtain 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3&#8208;e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the selective 7&#8208;endo cyclization/cross&#8208;coupling to access to 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The protocol operates under mild reaction conditions with divergent cyclization patterns that can be easily modulated through the ligand backbone.

Cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis allows the formal (3+2) cycloaddition of vinylcyclopropanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters to generate functionalized cyclopentanes via an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediate with the addition of LiCl crucial to obtain high product diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A protocol for the enantioselective synthesis of substituted vinylcyclopentanes has been realised using cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis. Treatment of vinylcyclopropanes with Pd(PPh3)4 generates a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate that intercepts a catalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium species prepared from the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated para&#8208;nitrophenyl ester and the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM. Intermolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition between these reactive intermediates generates functionalised cyclopentanes in generally good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr, 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 er), with the use of LiCl as an additive proving essential for optimal stereocontrol. To the best of our knowledge a dual transition metal/organocatalytic process involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates has not been demonstrated previously.

         <title>Discrete, Cationic Palladium(II)&#8208;Oxo Clusters via f&#8208;Metal Ion Incorporation and their Macrocyclic Host&#8208;Guest Interactions with Sulfonatocalixarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The first cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing f&#8208;metal ions, [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=CeIV, ThIV), have been structurally characterized and utilized as electrocatalysts. These POCs exhibit host&#8208;guest interactions with 4&#8208;sulfocalix[n]arenes (n=4, 6, 8), resulting in the first examples of discrete, enthalpically&#8208;driven supramolecular assemblies between calixarene&#8208;based macrocycles and large metal&#8208;oxo clusters.







Abstract
We report on the discovery of the first two examples of cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing f&#8208;metal ions, [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=CeIV, ThIV), and their physicochemical characterization in the solid state, in solution and in the gas phase. The molecular structure of the two novel POCs comprises an octahedral {Pd6O12}12&#8722; core that is capped by eight MIV ions, resulting in a cationic, cubic assembly {Pd6O12MIV8}20+, which is coordinated by a total of 16 terminal dimethylarsinate and eight water ligands, resulting in the mixed PdII&#8208;CeIV/ThIV oxo&#8208;clusters [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=Ce, Pd6Ce8; Th, Pd6Th8). We have also studied the formation of host&#8208;guest inclusion complexes of Pd6Ce8 and Pd6Th8 with anionic 4&#8208;sulfocalix[n]arenes (n=4, 6, 8), resulting in the first examples of discrete, enthalpically&#8208;driven supramolecular assemblies between large metal&#8208;oxo clusters and calixarene&#8208;based macrocycles. The POCs were also found to be useful as pre&#8208;catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;reduction and HCOOH&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Structure of an Ultrathin Oxide on Pt3Sn(111) Solved by Machine Learning Enhanced Global Optimization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning techniques can be implemented to accelerate surface structure determination based on density functional theory. The application of such an algorithm is demonstrated here for a surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111) which had eluded determination by experimental methods.







Abstract
Determination of the atomic structure of solid surfaces typically depends on comparison of measured properties with simulations based on hypothesized structural models. For simple structures, the models may be guessed, but for more complex structures there is a need for reliable theory&#8208;based search algorithms. So far, such methods have been limited by the combinatorial complexity and computational expense of sufficiently accurate energy estimation for surfaces. However, the introduction of machine learning methods has the potential to change this radically. Here, we demonstrate how an evolutionary algorithm, utilizing machine learning for accelerated energy estimation and diverse population generation, can be used to solve an unknown surface structure&#8212;the (4&#215;4) surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111)&#8212;based on limited experimental input. The algorithm is efficient and robust, and should be broadly applicable in surface studies, where it can replace manual, intuition based model generation.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Based Nanolayer for Copper Film Oxidation Mitigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti rust carbenes: A 2&#8197;nm thick nanolayer was deposited on a Cu film by selective electrochemical deposition and on&#8208;surface polymerization of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Nanolayer formation inhibited copper oxidation under elevated temperatures and alkaline conditions.







Abstract
The wide use of copper is limited by its rapid oxidation. Main oxidation mitigation approaches involve alloying or surface passivation technologies. However, surface alloying often modifies the physical properties of copper, while surface passivation is characterized by limited thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical approach for surface&#8208;anchoring of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nanolayer on a copper electrode by electro&#8208;deposition of alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations. Water reduction reaction generated a high concentration of hydroxide ions that induced deprotonation of imidazolium cations and self&#8208;assembly of NHCs on the copper electrode. In addition, alkyne group deprotonation enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization by coupling surface&#8208;anchored and solvated NHCs, which resulted in a 2&#8197;nm thick NHC&#8208;nanolayer. Copper film coated with a NHC&#8208;nanolayer demonstrated high oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures and under alkaline conditions.

         <title>Enhancing Circulation and Tumor Accumulation of Carboplatin via an Erythrocyte&#8208;Anchored Prodrug Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboplatin&#8208;based platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes is reported. The as&#8208;prepared prodrug ERY1&#8208;PtIV has a prolonged circulatory half&#8208;life, enhanced tumor accumulation, and improved antitumor effect compared to carboplatin in vivo via this erythrocyte&#8208;anchored strategy.







Abstract
The short circulatory half&#8208;lives and low tumor accumulation of carboplatin greatly limit the drug's efficacy in vivo. Herein, we address these challenges by using a prodrug strategy and present the rational design of a novel platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes. This prodrug, designated as ERY1&#8208;PtIV, can bind to erythrocytes efficiently and stably, possessing a circulatory half&#8208;life 18.5&#8197;times longer than that of carboplatin in mice. This elongated circulatory half&#8208;life enables platinum to accumulate at levels 7.7&#8197;times higher than with carboplatin, with steady levels in the tumors. As a consequence, the ERY1&#8208;PtIV prodrug is proved to exhibit significantly enhanced antitumor activity and reduced side effects compared with carboplatin. Collectively, our novel approach highlights an efficient strategy to utilize intrinsic erythrocytes as auto&#8208;binding carriers to enhance the tumor accumulation and subsequent antitumor efficacy of platinum drugs.

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Free, Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted, and Activatable Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy with Real&#8208;Time In&#8208;Situ Therapeutic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free and mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizers (PSs) with the real&#8208;time in situ self&#8208;reporting ability was constructed for photodynamic cancer therapy. Based on the platform, activatable PSs were further developed, and their ability in either selective killing of cancer cells over normal cells or in effectively ablating an implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.







Abstract
Based on spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing mechanism, two heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) BDP1/BDP2 with absorption maxima at 506&#8197;nm/660&#8197;nm were constructed for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The long triplet state lifetimes and large singlet oxygen quantum yields, coupled with the mitochondria&#8208;targeted feature, made them highly phototoxic toward cancer cells. Moreover, the PDT&#8208;promoted cell apoptosis could be monitored by an obvious fluorescence off&#8208;on response of the two PSs due to the concomitant activation of extensive mitophagy, thus facilitating timely therapeutic feedback to avoid under&#8208; or over&#8208;treatment. Importantly, such design allows the activatable PSs Glu&#8208;BDP1/Glu&#8208;BDP2 to be fabricated by attaching &#947;&#8208;glutamyl, a substrate of &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase, to the alkoxyaniline unit of BDP1/BDP2, and their ability in either selectively killing cancer cells over normal cells or in ablating implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.

         <title>Triggering near&#8208;infrared luminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine by charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;state dependent &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; molecular photo&#8208;switches are of present interest for novel optoelectronics. We have used mass&#8208;selective ion beam deposition into solid Ne at 5&#8197;K to compare the spectral properties of vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc&#8901;) with its singly charged cation. Electron detachment from VOPc&#8901; leads to a diradical cation (VOPc+..) which shows profound NIR photoluminescence. By contrast, VOPc&#8901; is essentially non&#8208;emissive.







Abstract
Probing electrofluorochromism (EFC) at the molecular level remains challenging. Here we study the strongly charge state&#8208;dependent photoluminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We report vibrationally resolved absorption and laser&#8208;induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the mass&#8208;selected neutral molecule (VOPc&#8901;, a stable radical) and its cation produced upon electron ionization (EI) isolated in 5&#8197;K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non&#8208;emissive VOPc&#8901; forms a high&#8208;spin diradical cation (VOPc+..) which shows profound photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR range. This unique phenomenon is potentially of interest for NIR&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;optic devices.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Amination of Cyclic Amine Scaffolds Enabled by Polar&#8208;Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H amination of cyclic amines has been developed that allows a convenient approach to the highly valuable &#945;&#8208;amino derivatives. The reaction proceeds via a relay cycle engaging a series of polar and radical processes, triggered by initial access to the key iminium intermediate using only 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of oxidant as initiator. This protocol is practical and sustainable, and shows excellent applicability.







Abstract
Herein, we report a polar&#8208;radical relay strategy for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H amination of cyclic amines with N&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;sodio&#8208;carbamates. The relay is initiated by in situ generation of cyclic iminium intermediate using N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) oxidant as an initiator, which then operates through a series of polar (addition and elimination) and radical (homolysis, hydrogen&#8208; and halogen atom transfer) reactions to enable the challenging C&#8722;N bond formation in a controlled manner. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino cyclic amines were readily accessed with excellent regioselectivity, and the superb applicability was further demonstrated by functionalization of biologically relevant compounds.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on Ordered Silicon Nanowire Array Photocathodes</title>

Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction on an Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode provides a new path to green ammonia production with an outstanding Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials using solar energy.







Abstract
As a new path to &#8220;green&#8221; ammonia production, photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) is investigated for the first time. An Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode demonstrates 95.6&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) to ammonia at 0.2&#8197;VRHE, which represents a more positive potential than the thermodynamic reduction potential of nitrate by utilizing photovoltage. The high FE is possible because both Si and Au surfaces are inactive for competing water reduction to hydrogen. The O_SiNW array structure is favorable to promote the PEC NO3RR relative to planar Si or randomly&#8208;grown Si nanowire, by enabling the uniform distribution of small Au nanoparticles as an electrocatalyst and facilitating the mass transport during the reaction. The results demonstrate the feasibility of PEC nitrate conversion to ammonia and would motivate further studies and developments.

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Couples from Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient recycling of catalyst&#8208;solvent couples was showcased in enantioselective Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions that were run in highly Lewis basic environments in which there is a greater risk of metal leaching. The success is attributed to a bioinspired approach to heterogenize microhydrated chiral Lewis acids within appropriate hydrophobic cavities, thereby decreasing catalyst deactivation and suppressing metal leaching.







Abstract
Bioinspired supramolecular architectures were used to compartmentalize highly charged aqua scandium ions into chiral hydrophobic scaffolds for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions. Recycling without significant loss in catalytic performance is a formidable task, especially for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. This is because Lewis basic impurities derived from starting materials, products, and water are highly competitive ligands for both substrate binding and metal complexation, thus poisoning the Lewis acids and leading to their leaching. Even when basic aniline is used, the architecture allowed for effective suppression of Sc3+ leaching and for reuse of solvent&#8208;catalyst couples in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions without deactivation. Application to asymmetric thia&#8208;Michael addition and hydroxymethylation was also demonstrated. The successful recycling in highly Lewis basic environments underpins the exceptionally high robustness of the chiral Lewis acid catalyst.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Surfactant Assemblies: Responsiveness to Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently modifying a polyoxometalate with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin has led to the formation of a polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin hybrid. The hybrid, when dissolved in water, can assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces with ligands dissolved in toluene, thereby generating polyoxometalate surfactants (POMSs) with pH, redox or guest&#8211;competitive responsiveness.







Abstract
Integrating different types of supramolecular interactions opens the possibility to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface that are responsive to multiple stimuli. Here we develop a covalently modified polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (POM/&#946;&#8208;CD) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid, consisting of a negatively charged POM cluster with &#946;&#8208;CD host groups. The POM/&#946;&#8208;CD hybrid can be dispersed in water and interacts at a water/oil interface with ligands dissolved in an oil phase through electrostatic or host&#8211;guest interactions, thereby generating POM&#8208;surfactants (POMSs) having pH, redox, and guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness, respectively. By taking advantage of the jamming of POMSs at the interface, a reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid system could be produced that is responsive to orthogonal changes in the external environment.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Stabilizes Olefin Facilitated Transport Membranes Against Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver ions, olefin carriers, are generally vulnerable to hydrogen present in olefin/paraffin mixture feed. Ionic liquid solubilizes and stabilizes silver ion carriers for olefins by forming aggregates. The aggregates significantly enhance carrier stability against reduction by hydrogen.







Abstract
Separation of olefins from their paraffin analogs relies on energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Facilitated transport&#8208;based membranes that reversibly and selectively bind olefins, but not paraffins, could save considerable amounts of energy. However, the chemical instability of the silver ion olefin&#8208;binding carriers in such membranes has been a longstanding roadblock for this approach. We discovered long&#8208;term carrier stability against extended exposure to hydrogen, a common contaminant in such streams. Based on UV/Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy, along with XRD analysis results, certain ionic liquids solubilize silver ions, and anion aggregates surrounding the silver ion carriers greatly attenuate their reduction by hydrogen. Here, we report the stability of olefin/paraffin separation properties under continuous exposure to high pressure hydrogen, which addresses a critical technical roadblock in membrane&#8208;based olefin/paraffin separation.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polymer Drives Performance Enhancement of Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of ferroelectric polymer polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) as additive into non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells substantially enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. Promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced charge recombination, as well as optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved device performance.







Abstract
Enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field to promote charge dynamitic process is of great significance to boost the performance of the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), which has rarely been concerned. In this work, we introduced a cheap ferroelectric polymer as an additive into the active layers of non&#8208;fullerene OSCs to improve the device performance. An additional and permanent electrical field was produced by the polarization of the ferroelectric dipoles, which can substantially enhance the built&#8208;in electric field. The promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced the charge recombination, as well as the optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved performance of the PVDF&#8208;modified OSCs with various active layers, such as PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;IT&#8208;4F and PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;Y6. Especially, a record efficiency of 17.72&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSC and an outstanding efficiency of 18.17&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSC were achieved.

         <title>Steering Self&#8208;Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional Iptycenes on Au(111) by Tuning Molecule&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivation of Au(111) with an iodine monolayer provides effective means to steer the adsorption of three&#8208;dimensional (f)antrip molecules. The stronger interaction on pristine Au(111) favours adsorption with two anthracene blades flat, promoting self&#8208;assembly of a densely packed structure. By contrast, on passivated Au(111) f(antrip) adsorbs with its three anthracene blades edge&#8208;on, giving rise to self&#8208;assembly of a porous structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of three&#8208;dimensional molecules is scarcely studied on surfaces. Their modes of adsorption can exhibit far greater variability compared to (nearly) planar molecules that adsorb mostly flat on surfaces. This additional degree of freedom can have decisive consequences for the expression of intermolecular binding motifs, hence the formation of supramolecular structures. The determining molecule&#8208;surface interactions can be widely tuned, thereby providing a new powerful lever for crystal engineering in two dimensions. Here, we study the self&#8208;assembly of triptycene derivatives with anthracene blades on Au(111) by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, Near Edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure and Density Functional Theory. The impact of molecule&#8208;surface interactions was experimentally tested by comparing pristine with iodine&#8208;passivated Au(111) surfaces. Thereby, we observed a fundamental change of the adsorption mode that triggered self&#8208;assembly of an entirely different structure.

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Mediated Ion Specific Effects Enable Salt Tolerance of a Pore&#8208;Forming Marine Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of density functional theory, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, mutational studies, and antimicrobial assays show that the histidine residues of a marine antimicrobial peptide coordinate sodium ions and the phosphate in headgroups of lipids to maintain the activity of the peptide at high salt concentrations. The placement of histidines in the &#945;&#8208;helical conformation of the peptide is critical.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) preferentially permeate prokaryotic membranes via electrostatic binding and membrane remodeling. Such action is drastically suppressed by high salt due to increased electrostatic screening, thus it is puzzling how marine AMPs can possibly work. We examine as a model system, piscidin&#8208;1, a histidine&#8208;rich marine AMP, and show that ion&#8208;histidine interactions play unanticipated roles in membrane remodeling at high salt: Histidines can simultaneously hydrogen&#8208;bond to a phosphate and coordinate with an alkali metal ion to neutralize phosphate charge, thereby facilitating multidentate bonds to lipid headgroups in order to generate saddle&#8208;splay curvature, a prerequisite to pore formation. A comparison among Na+, K+, and Cs+ indicates that histidine&#8208;mediated salt tolerance is ion specific. We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide&#8208;membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high&#8208;salt environment.

We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide-membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high-salt environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent Organic &#960;&#8208;Radicals Stabilized with Boron: Featuring a SOMO&#8211;LUMO Electronic Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy of emissive and stable &#960;&#8208;radicals is established based on incorporation of a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition in the boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;radicals gives rise to intense red fluorescence, irrespective of solvent polarity, different from donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type emissive &#960;&#8208;radicals.







Abstract
We report on the fluorescence properties of a new class of emissive and stable &#960;&#8208;radicals that contain a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. A fully planarized derivative exhibited an intense red fluorescence with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F &gt;0.67) even in polar solvents. To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we synthesized another boron&#8208;stabilized radical that contains a bulky aryl group on the boron atom. A comparison of these derivatives, as well as with conventional donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A)&#8208;type emissive &#960;&#8208;radicals, unveiled several characteristic features in their photophysical properties. A theoretical analysis revealed that the SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition generates an emissive D1 state. Unlike conventional D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;radicals, this state does not undergo significant structural relaxation. The boron&#8208;stabilized &#960;&#8208;radicals demonstrated promising potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes as an emitting material.

         <title>Controlled Tetradeuteration of Straight&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids: Synthesis, Application, and Insight into the Metabolism of Oxidized Linoleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions has been developed. The use of four deuterium atoms in fatty acids as well as a diagnostic peak of phosphatidylcholines thus obtained enabled the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from an oxidized linoleic acid, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), to lysophosphatidylcholine.







Abstract
We describe a concise and reliable protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids (FAs) at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions that is generally applicable to a variety of FAs, including trans&#8208;FAs, polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and their oxidized derivatives. The precisely controlled introduction of four deuterium atoms into the FAs enables their persistent and quantitative tracking by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis based on their molecular structures. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species prepared from the tetradeuterated FAs thus obtained give a diagnostic peak, namely, a phosphocholine fragment that contains deuterium, in the LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. With these features, the metabolism of a representative oxidized linoleic acid, that is, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), was investigated, leading to the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from HODE to lysophosphatidylcholine.

         <title>PdII&#8208;Catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8722;H Activation Facilitated by a Transient Directing Group
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative cross&#8208;coupling between two alkenes under the dual action of a PdII catalyst and a transient directing group (TDG) is demonstrated. The reaction involves TDG&#8208;mediated C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation to generate an endo&#8208;palladacycle intermediate, whose formation is promoted by a tailored carboxylic acid additive.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8722;H alkenylation enabled by a transient directing group (TDG) strategy is described. The dual catalytic process takes advantage of reversible condensation between an alkenyl aldehyde substrate and an amino acid TDG to facilitate coordination of the metal catalyst and subsequent C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation by a tailored carboxylate base. The resulting palladacycle then engages an acceptor alkene, furnishing a 1,3&#8208;diene with high regio&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;selectivity. The reaction enables the synthesis of enantioenriched atropoisomeric 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes, which have seldom been examined in previous literature. Catalytically relevant alkenyl palladacycles were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the energy profiles of the C(alkenyl)&#8722;H activation step and the stereoinduction model were elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract
During the global crisis triggered by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, university programs, meetings, and conferences have moved to virtual settings, with consequent erosion of mentorship opportunities for students and early&#8208;career professionals. This calls for mentorship platforms that are adapted to the new landscape in order to bring about a positive change. Our Viewpoint Article shares the perspective of the Transformative Education program and Mentorship Talks initiative at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, with the aim of providing insights that could stimulate other mentorship platforms.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light of deuterium shines in the darkness of the molecular mechanism of the oxidized phosphatidylcholine synthesis. A concise protocol for the controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids is reported by Kotaro Hama, Ryo Takita, and co&#8208;workers (e202202779). The use of four deuterium atoms in fatty acids as well as a diagnostic peak of phosphatidylcholines thus obtained enabled the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from an oxidized linoleic acid.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for the synthesis of chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) under ambient conditions is developed by Bing&#8208;Jian Yao, Yu&#8208;Bin Dong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202115044). With a chiral 2&#8208;methylpyrrolidine catalyst, a series of tris(N&#8208;salicylideneamine)&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine CCOFs were constructed from prochiral monomers via Schiff&#8208;base condensation. The metalated CCOFs promote asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reactions at a gram&#8208;scale level in a fixed&#8208;bed model reactor.

Aluminium ion batteries (AIBs) hold great prospects in the development of sustainable energy storage. A heterocycle&#8208;conjugate polymer nanoarchitectonic with synergistic redox&#8208;active C=O/C=N centres and &#960;&#8208;conjugation for high&#8208;performance AIBs was revealed by Yusuke Yamauchi, Lianzhou Wang, Bin Luo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article&#160;(e202203646). The fused C=N sites assist neighbouring C=O to uptake four AlCl2(urea)2+ per repeating unit, enabling batteries with high capacity, long cycle life, and high energy/power density.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Mesoporous Crystalline TiO2 Materials by Monomicelle Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring mesoporous TiO2 at the mesoscopic and microscopic level has been advancing in the last decade as its unique nanoscale architectures are of great importance for various applications. This Review surveys and discusses how to synthesize a series of novel mesoporous TiO2 materials, with the aim of highlighting how precise control can be achieved over the mesostructure and also potential synthetic directions.







Abstract
Mesoscale TiO2 structures have realized many technological applications&#8212;ranging from catalysis and biomedicine to energy storage and conversion&#8212;because of their large mesoporosities offering desirable accessibility and mass transport. Tailoring mesoporous TiO2 structures with novel mesoscopic and microscopic configurations is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for further applications. In this Review, we explain how to synthesize novel mesoporous TiO2 materials and present recent examples. An emphasis is placed on a &#8220;monomicelle assembly&#8221; strategy as an emerging and powerful approach to direct the formation of mesostructured TiO2 with precise control over its structural orientations and architectures. Furthermore, typical examples of mesoporous TiO2 for applications in batteries and photocatalysis are highlighted. The Review ends with an outlook towards the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 with tailored architectures by self&#8208;assembly, which could pave the way for developing advanced energy conversion and storage devices.

         <title>Development of High&#8208;Energy Anodes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries Based on Sulfide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research on anode electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is summarized and a novel design principle is suggested for an advanced anode with very low volume change. Porous carbon&#8208;based current collectors will provide room for site&#8208;specific Li&#8208;plating/stripping with high reversibility.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSBs) promise better performance and higher safety than the current liquid&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Sulfide ASSBs have been extensively studied and considerably advanced in recent decades. Research on identifying suitable cathode materials for sulfide ASSBs is currently well established, with great progress being made in the commercialization of layered cathodes in the liquid&#8208;based LIBs. Research on anode materials for sulfide ASSBs is of great importance for enhancing the battery energy density. However, it seems that little has been published that summarizes studies of anode materials for sulfide ASSBs and suggests future research directions. Thus, within this Minireview, we aim to provide an overview of previous and current research focused on anode materials for sulfide ASSBs and to suggest a future research direction for developing suitable anode systems for sulfide ASSBs.

         <title>Adsorption in Reversed Order of C2 Hydrocarbons on an Ultramicroporous Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) shows a reversed adsorption order for C2 hydrocarbons. The C2 hydrocarbon uptake of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follow the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2 and not the usual C2H2&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H6.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks have been widely studied in the separation of C2 hydrocarbons, which usually preferentially bind unsaturated hydrocarbons with the order of acetylene (C2H2)&gt;ethylene (C2H4)&gt;ethane (C2H6). Herein, we report an ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;FBA (H2FBA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid)), shows a reversed adsorption order characteristic for C2 hydrocarbons, that the uptake for C2 hydrocarbons of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follows the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm that the completely reversed adsorption order behavior is attributed to the close van der Waals interactions and multiple cooperative C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonds between the framework and C2H6. Moreover, Zn&#8208;FBA exhibits a high selectivity of about 2.9 for C2H6 over C2H4 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. The experimental breakthrough studies show that the high&#8208;purity C2H4 can be obtained from C2H6 and C2H4 mixtures in one step.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Effects on Aqueous Electrolyte for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The electrochemical isotope effects between heavy water (D2O) and light water (H2O) were revealed to shed light on rational electrolyte design towards the realization of high&#8208;performance aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
As two stable hydrogen isotopes, protium and deuterium show magnified isotope effects in physicochemical properties due to the significantly varied atomic masses. In this work, aqueous electrolytes based on heavy water (D2O) and light water (H2O) were prepared to reveal the electrochemical isotope effects between the hydrogen isotopes. The covalent hydrogen&#8211;oxygen bond and intermolecular hydrogen bond in D2O are much stronger than those in H2O, making them thermodynamically more stable. Compared with the H2O&#8208;based electrolyte, the D2O&#8208;based electrolyte shows a broader electrochemical window, a higher percentage of coordinated water and a longer lifetime of hydrogen bond. Because of the above electrochemical isotope effects, the D2O&#8208;based electrolyte shows high anodic stability against operation of high&#8208;voltage layered oxide cathode materials including LiCoO2 and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, which enables long cycle life and favorable rate performance of aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity of a Hydrido&#8208; and Imido&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex (2) was synthesized via the reaction of an ytterbium(II) hydrido complex (1) with Me3SiN3. This unusual product represents the first example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands. DFT calculations indicated that the N2 release from Me3SiN3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers.







Abstract
The trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands, namely a hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N2 release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers. The reactivity of the hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex was also explored, which showed the redox, addition and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactivities.

         <title>Computational Identification and Experimental Demonstration of High&#8208;Performance Methane Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising MOFs were identified computationally and experimentally demonstrate remarkable methane uptake that outperforms known benchmarks both volumetrically and gravimetrically. An advanced set of interatomic potentials that explicitly account for the presence of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) in MOFs were used to identify the high&#8208;capacity MOFs that were previously overlooked due to the limitation of the general interatomic potentials.







Abstract
Remarkable methane uptake is demonstrated experimentally in three metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) identified by computational screening: UTSA&#8208;76, UMCM&#8208;152 and DUT&#8208;23&#8208;Cu. These MOFs outperform the benchmark sorbent, HKUST&#8208;1, both volumetrically and gravimetrically, under a pressure swing of 80 to 5&#8197;bar at 298&#8197;K. Although high uptake at elevated pressure is critical for achieving this performance, a low density of high&#8208;affinity sites (coordinatively unsaturated metal centers) also contributes to a more complete release of stored gas at low pressure. The identification of these MOFs facilitates the efficient storage of natural gas via adsorption and provides further evidence of the utility of computational screening in identifying overlooked sorbents.

         <title>A Hierarchical (Macro)molecular Assembly Assisted by Donor&#8211;Acceptor Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions Exhibiting Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>

Charge&#8208;transfer interactions aid the formation of the tertiary structure of an aromatic acceptor&#8208;appended polymer. The presence of an aromatic donor produces an organogel with nanotubular morphology, which exhibits room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity.







Abstract
This communication reveals co&#8208;assembly of an electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI)&#8208;appended polyurethane (P1) and electron&#8208;rich pyrene (Py), forming an organogel with prominent room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. In a non&#8208;polar medium, intra&#8208;chain hydrogen&#8208;bonding among the urethane groups of P1 produces a folded structure with an array of the NDIs in the periphery, which intercalate Py by charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;interaction. Such CT&#8208;complexation enables slow crystallization of the peripheral hydrocarbons, causing gelation with nanotubular morphology, in which the wall consists of the alternating NDI&#8722;Py stack. Such D&#8208;A assembly exhibits ferroelectricity (saturation polarization Ps&#8776;0.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and coercive field Ec&#8776;8&#8197;kV&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;V and 10&#8197;Hz frequency) with Curie temperature (Tc) of &#8776;350&#8197;K, which can be related to the disassembly of the CT&#8208;complex. In the absence of Py, P1 forms spherical aggregates, showing dielectric behaviour.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Flexible Organic Crystal with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral enantiomers with circularly polarized luminescence were designed and employed as building blocks to construct organic crystals with excellent low&#8208;temperature (77&#8197;K) elasticity. The bent crystal functions as an efficient optical waveguide at low temperature (77&#8197;K), thus indicating its potential application in extreme environments.







Abstract
Flexible organic crystals with unique mechanical properties and excellent optical properties are of paramount significance for their wide applications in various research fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. However, low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant flexible organic crystal with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has never been reported. Herein, chiral organic crystals with CPL activity and low&#8208;temperature flexibility (77&#8197;K) are fabricated by the solvent diffusion method from chiral Schiff base, S(R)&#8208;4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;(((1&#8208;phenylethyl)imino)methyl)phenol (S(R)&#8208;BPEMP). The corresponding chirooptical properties for the two enantiomeric crystals were thoroughly investigated, including the measurements of circular dichroism (CD) and CPL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight flexible organic crystals with CPL activity, and we believe that the results will give a new impetus to the research of organic crystals.

The corresponding chirooptical properties for the two enantiomeric crystals were thoroughly investigated, including the measurements of circular dichroism (CD) and CPL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on low-molecular-weight flexible organic crystals with CPL activity, and we believe that the results will give a new impetus to the research of organic crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines: Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more fluorine the better? Pentafluorophosphato amino acids A and B are stable new molecular entities showing surprisingly high binding affinities to the phosphotyrosine binding site of a protein tyrosine phosphatase&#8212;better than the current gold standard for phosphotyrosine mimetics. PF5 motifs display remarkable fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and thus might enable a new class of potent tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8722;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>The Mechanochemistry of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed o&#8208;carborane as a new mechanophore that possesses an unexpected combination of force&#8208;free stability and force&#8208;coupled activity. By contrast, m&#8208;carborane, which has a different regiochemistry maintained its high mechanical stability. This fundamental research straightforwardly presents new insights into the remarkable &#8220;expandability of the C&#8722;C covalent bond&#8221; in o&#8208;carborane by applying external force stimuli.







Abstract
We developed o&#8208;carborane as a new mechanophore by showing that the o&#8208;carborane cluster is the preferred scission site in chain&#8208;centered polymers through ultrasonication mechanochemistry. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a predominately homolytic mechanism of chain scission. The mechanically generated monocarbaborane fragments are highly reactive toward alcohol nucleophiles. By contrast, carborane with a different regiochemistry (m&#8208;carborane) maintained its high mechanical stability. DFT simulations provide insights into the origins of carborane's mechanical lability. This fundamental research provides a new stimulus for carborane cage activation.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Directed Regulation of Structures and Luminescence of Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions were employed to direct the regulation of the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Two novel clusters with triangular bipyramidal CAu6Ag5 (2) and hexagram&#8208;like CAu6Ag6 (3) cores were obtained from the CAu6Ag4 type precursor 1. They exhibit red&#8208; or blue&#8208;shifted luminescence, respectively. Remarkably, the quantum yields of 2 and 3 are one order of magnitude higher than 1.







Abstract
Anions have been used to regulate the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Introducing ClO4&#8722; into orange&#8208;emissive, butterfly&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag4](BF4)6 (1, PPhpy2=bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenylphosphine) leads to the formation of red&#8208;emissive [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag5(ClO4)3](ClO4)4 (2) with a novel trigonal bipyramidal structure; employing PhCO2&#8722; gives yellow&#8208;emissive, hexagram&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag6(PhCO2)3](BF4)5 (3). Notably, 1 exhibits weak luminescence in CH2Cl2/CH3OH=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (v&#8201;:&#8201;v) with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.05, whereas it was dramatically increased to 0.49 and 0.83 for 2 and 3, respectively. Theoretical calculation confirms that the involvement of anions in the electronic structures is responsible for the shifts of emission. The high QYs of 2 and 3 are attributed to the protection provided by ligands and anions. This work demonstrates that anions may serve as an extra designable factor beyond just counterions for functional metal clusters.

         <title>Syntheses of Covalent Organic Frameworks via a One&#8208;Pot Suzuki Coupling and Schiff's Base Reaction for C2H4/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot strategy is used to prepare covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a Suzuki coupling reaction and Schiff's base reaction by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resulting COFs are used for C2H4/C3H6 separation. This work provides a novel modular approach involving irreversible coupling reactions for constructing COF materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring permanent porosity, designable topologies, and tailorable functionalities have attracted great interest in the past two decades. Developing efficient modular approaches to rationally constructing COFs from a set of molecules via covalent linking has been long pursued. Herein, we report a facile one&#8208;pot strategy to prepare COFs via an irreversible Suzuki coupling reaction followed by a reversible Schiff's base reaction without the need for intermediate isolation. Gram&#8208;scale ordered frameworks with kgm topology and rich porosities can be obtained by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resultant microporous CR&#8208;COFs were used for efficient C2H4/C3H6 separation. This strategy reduces the waste generated and efforts consumed by stepwise reactions and relative purification processes, making the large&#8208;scale syntheses of stable COFs feasible. Moreover, it offers a novel modular approach to designing COF materials.

         <title>Charge Reservoirs in an Expanded Halide Perovskite Analog: Enhancing High&#8208;Pressure Conductivity through Redox&#8208;Active Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active organic cations can act as charge reservoirs in the expanded perovskite analog (dmpz)[Sn2I6]. Material compression increases electronic conductivity by five orders of magnitude. This conductivity rise is attributed to an increased hole density in the valence band, caused by electron transfer to the redox&#8208;active molecules.







Abstract
As halide perovskites and their derivatives are being developed for numerous optoelectronic applications, controlling their electronic doping remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, we describe a novel strategy of using redox&#8208;active organic molecules as stoichiometric electron acceptors. The cavities in the new expanded perovskite analogs (dmpz)[Sn2X6], (X=Br&#8722; (1Br) and I&#8722; (1I)) are occupied by dmpz2+ (N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylpyrazinium), with the LUMOs lying ca. 1&#8197;eV above the valence band maximum (VBM). Compressing the metal&#8208;halide framework drives up the VBM in 1I relative to the dmpz LUMO. The electronic conductivity increases by a factor of 105 with pressure, reaching 50(17)&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8197;GPa, exceeding the high&#8208;pressure conductivities of most halide perovskites. This conductivity enhancement is attributed to an increased hole density created by dmpz2+ reduction. This work elevates the role of organic cations in 3D metal&#8208;halides, from templating the structure to serving as charge reservoirs for tuning the carrier concentration.

         <title>A General Strategy for Kilogram&#8208;Scale Preparation of Highly Crystal&#8208;line Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general polyphosphoric acid (H6P4O13)&#8208;catalyzed strategy is developed to synthesize a series of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with high specific surface areas at the kilogram level for the first time. The polymerization mechanism study reveals a much higher catalytic activity of H6P4O13 than its analogues such as P2O5 and H3PO4. Crystalline porous CTFs can be practically used as a highly efficient adsorbent for large&#8208;scale antibiotic removal.







Abstract
Scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of crystalline porous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is essential to realize their broad industrial applications but remains a great challenge, which requires the fundamental understanding of the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization mechanism. Herein, we report a universal polyphosphoric acid (H6P4O13)&#8208;catalyzed nitrile trimerization route to synthesize a series of highly crystalline CTFs with high specific surface areas. This new strategy enables the cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale fabrication of crystalline CTFs at kilogram level for the first time. Through density functional theory calculation and detailed controlled experiments, we reveal that the polyphosphate acid show much higher catalytic activity for trimerization reaction than its analogues such as P2O5 and H3PO4. Furthermore, the crystalline CTFs with regular porosity and abundant triazine groups exhibit ultrahigh removal efficiency of micropollutants, indicating its great potential in environment remediation.

         <title>Direct and Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species in Living Cells Using a SERS Borrowing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based Au@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoprobe (Au@Pt NP) was developed for simultaneous and direct spectroscopic detection and identification of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS). Triphenylphosphine&#8208;functionalized Au@Pt&#8208;TPP NPs were able to locate to the mitochondria for the detection and identification of different mitochondrial ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stress.







Abstract
Identification of different mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) simultaneously in living cells is vital for understanding the critical roles of different ROS in biological processes. To date, it remains a great challenge to develop ROS probes for direct and simultaneous identification of multiple ROS with high specificity. Herein, we report a SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based nanoprobe (Au@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles) for simultaneous and direct identification of different ROS by their distinct Raman fingerprints. Isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations confirmed the ability of Au@Pt nanoprobe to capture and identify different mitochondrial ROS (i.e. &#8901;OOH, H2O2, and &#8901;OH). When functionalized with triphenylphosphine (TPP), the Au@Pt&#8208;TPP nanoprobe located to mitochondria and detected multiple ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stimulation. Our method offers a new tool for the study of the functions of various ROS in biological processes.

         <title>Dendrite Issues for Zinc Anodes in a Flexible Cell Configuration for Zinc&#8208;Based Wearable Energy&#8208;Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most studies and optimizations of Zn anodes for batteries are based on a planar working mode, ignoring the flexible modes needed for wearable devices. Herein, the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curved areas and the correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells are studied. Ideal cell configurations are shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with good mechanical properties and high adhesivity.







Abstract
A key application of aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;based batteries (RZBs) is flexible and wearable energy storage devices (FESDs). Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes needed. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas of flexible anodes. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. The interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Thus a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed that demonstrates a highly stable cell performance. This work provides a new perspective in Zn anode research for the development of FESDs.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Panowamycins, TM&#8208;135, and Veramycin&#8197;F Using C&#8722;H Insertion with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>

Total Synthesis Shell Game: The asymmetric first synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, veramycin&#8197;F, and two unnatural isomers in a stereoselective fashion, featuring a dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reaction with donor/donor carbenes in the key step to construct the isochroman core, is reported. These syntheses reveal a structural misassignment for panowamycin&#8197;A and computational NMR studies unveil the correct configuration of the natural isomer, which was also synthesized.







Abstract
Panowamycins are a group of isochroman&#8208;based natural products first isolated from Streptomyces sp. K07&#8208;0010 in 2012 by Satoshi &#332;mura and co&#8208;workers that exhibit modest anti&#8208;trypanosomal activity. Herein we demonstrate the first syntheses of these natural products and their epimers. Stereoselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reactions with a donor/donor carbene construct the substituted isochroman core in the key bond&#8208;forming step. The syntheses are completed without the use of protecting groups and feature a late&#8208;stage Wacker oxidation. Incongruent NMR spectra between natural and synthetic samples revealed the structural misassignment of panowamycin&#8197;A and veramycin&#8197;F. Computational NMR studies suggested panowamycin&#8197;A to be an alternate diastereomer, which was confirmed by synthesizing this isomer.

     alt="Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Panowamycins, TM-135, and Veramycin&#8197;F Using C&#8722;H Insertion with Donor/Donor Carbenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Synthesis Shell Game: The asymmetric first synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM-135, veramycin&#8197;F, and two unnatural isomers in a stereoselective fashion, featuring a dirhodium-catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reaction with donor/donor carbenes in the key step to construct the isochroman core, is reported. These syntheses reveal a structural misassignment for panowamycin&#8197;A and computational NMR studies unveil the correct configuration of the natural isomer, which was also synthesized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panowamycins are a group of isochroman-based natural products first isolated from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. K07-0010 in 2012 by Satoshi &#332;mura and co-workers that exhibit modest anti-trypanosomal activity. Herein we demonstrate the first syntheses of these natural products and their epimers. Stereoselective dirhodium-catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reactions with a donor/donor carbene construct the substituted isochroman core in the key bond-forming step. The syntheses are completed without the use of protecting groups and feature a late-stage Wacker oxidation. Incongruent NMR spectra between natural and synthetic samples revealed the structural misassignment of panowamycin&#8197;A and veramycin&#8197;F. Computational NMR studies suggested panowamycin&#8197;A to be an alternate diastereomer, which was confirmed by synthesizing this isomer. Concurrent with this work, in 2021 Mahmud and co-workers came to the same conclusion with an updated NMR analysis of panowamycin&#8197;A. In a divergent, asymmetric sequence, we report the synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM-135, and veramycin&#8197;F.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Alkenylboronates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for the synthesis of cyclobutylboronates by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is presented. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to an alkenylboronate, which is an underexplored photochemical process. The process operates with a wide array of alkenylboronates and alkenes to generate a diverse range of products. The utility of the products is demonstrated in the synthesis of melicodenine&#8197;C.







Abstract
A new strategy for the synthesis of highly versatile cyclobutylboronates via the photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of alkenylboronates and alkenes is presented. The process is mechanistically different from other processes in that energy transfer occurs with the alkenylboronate as opposed to the other alkene. This strategy allows for the synthesis of an array of diverse cyclobutylboronates. The conversion of these adducts to other compounds as well as their utility in the synthesis of melicodenine&#8197;C is demonstrated.

         <title>Concentrated Aqueous Peroxodicarbonate: Efficient Electrosyn&#8208; thesis and Use as Oxidizer in Epoxidations, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical synthesis of concentrated (&#8776;1.0&#8201;m) peroxodicarbonate solutions was achieved by a newly designed electrolysis cell with an elaborate heat&#8208;transfer system, a ternary K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 electrolyte, and the use of high current densities of above 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Peroxodicarbonate solutions were shown to be powerful and green oxidizers, permitting N&#8208; and S&#8208;oxidations as well as epoxidations.







Abstract
Peroxodicarbonates are of substantial interest as potentially powerful and sustainable oxidizers but have so far been accessible only in low concentrations with unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Concentrated (&gt;&#160;0.9&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1) peroxodicarbonate solutions have now been made accessible by the electrolysis of aqueous K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 solutions at high current density of 3.33&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an efficiently cooled circular flow reactor equipped with a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode and a stainless&#8208;steel cathode. Their synthetic potential as platform oxidizers was clearly demonstrated in transformations including sulfoxidation, N&#8208;oxidation, and epoxidation.

         <title>Direct Affinity Purification of Long&#8208;Acting PASylated Proteins with Therapeutic Potential Using L&#8208;Prolinamide for Mild Elution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PASylation of pharmacologically active proteins or peptides drastically expands their hydrodynamic volume and, thus, retards renal filtration, which results in prolonged in vivo half&#8208;life. We have now developed an antibody&#8208;based affinity chromatography that permits the one&#8208;step purification of PASylated molecules in the native state using L&#8208;prolinamide as mild elution reagent.







Abstract
Both insufficient plasma half&#8208;life (circulation for only few hours or less) and laborious downstream purification can be bottleneck for biological drug development. We report a novel strategy for the efficient and gentle affinity purification of pharmacologically relevant proteins modified by PASylation for prolonged action in vivo. We previously described antibodies specific for Pro/Ala&#8208;rich sequences (PAS) covering a range of binding characteristics. Our present approach relies on a chromatography matrix functionalized with a low&#8208;affinity PAS&#8208;specific antibody Fab fragment for specific adsorption of the PASylated protein from a macromolecular mixture. With the complete absence of hydrophobic/aromatic or ionic groups in the PAS sequence epitope, binding is mediated by Van der Waals contacts and distinct hydrogen bonds only. Surprisingly, selective competitive elution is achieved by application of the highly soluble and biologically inactive imino acid derivative L&#8208;prolinamide. Based on the specific but strongly dynamic biomolecular interaction, our procedure allows the direct one&#8208;step purification of PASylated proteins from a cell extract or culture supernatant while avoiding harsh elution conditions as they are often needed for conventional affinity chromatography.

         <title>Diastereoselective Transfer of Tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes&#8208;Derived Carbenes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cis&#8208;selective cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes was developed for the synthesis of cyclopropanol derivatives. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as the key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.







Abstract
Stereoselective cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet&#8208;metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. However, previous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes with acylsilanes afforded low diastereoselectivity. Herein, we report the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with trifluoroacetylsilanes and difluoroacetylsilanes. Both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are suitable substrates for the highly cis&#8208;selective [2+1] cyclization reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as being key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Arylphosphinamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of arylphosphinamides with alkynes and allenes using a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalyst is reported. This new methodology provides an efficient approach for the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Previous methods on CoIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation rely on the use of tailor&#8208;made cyclopentadienyl&#8208;ligated CoIII complexes, which require lengthy steps for the preparation. Herein, we report an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The chiral Salox ligands can be easily prepared in one step from salicylonitrile and chiral amino alcohols. A broad range of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The isolation and characterization of several intermediates provided insights into the generation of active catalytic cobalt species, the action of Salox, and the mode of stereocontrol.

         <title>Synthesis of Genuine Germenyl Lithiums and the First Persistent Germenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel germenyl lithiums (1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b), having a genuine C=Ge bond and substituents with mild electronic effects, were synthesized and structurally characterized. Further oxidation of compounds 1&#8201;a (or 2&#8201;b) produced the first persistent germenyl radicals 13&#8201;a (or 13&#8201;b) which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The first isolated genuine germenyl lithiums (R3Si)(1&#8208;Ad)C=Ge(SiMetBu2)(Li&#8901;2&#8201;L) (R3Si=tBu2MeSi, L=THF (1&#8201;a), or L=12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (1&#8201;b) and R3Si=tBuMe2Si, L=THF (2&#8201;a), or L=12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (2&#8201;b)), were synthesized by reaction of the corresponding acyl germanes 3 and 4, respectively, with tBu2MeSiLi in THF at 70&#8201;&#176;C. The novel 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b were characterized by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, and also by X&#8208;ray crystallography (r(C=Ge)=1.865&#8197;&#197; for 1&#8201;a and 1.877&#8197;&#197; for 2&#8201;b). Nucleophilic addition reaction of 1&#8201;a with MeI and a C&#8722;H insertion reactions to the C=Ge bond of 1&#8201;a, 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b, are reported. Oxidation of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b (toluene, 230&#8197;K) produces the first persistent germenyl radicals (R3Si)(1&#8208;Ad)C=Ge&#8901;&#8208;(SiMetBu2) (R3Si=tBu2MeSi (13&#8201;a), R3Si=tBuMe2Si (13&#8201;b)), which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy (t1/2&#8776;30&#8197;min at 230&#8197;K, g=2.029, aav(73Ge) is 55.0G for 13&#8201;a and 60.2G for 13&#8201;b). The experimental EPR parameters and DFT calculations indicate that 13&#8201;a and 13&#8201;b have a strongly bent structure at Ge (calc. &#8737;(C=Ge&#8722;Si)=136.7&#176; (13&#8201;a), 135.9&#176; (13&#8201;b)), and that the unpaired electron has a substantial s&#8208;character.

         <title>Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclizations by Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsule Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioenriched hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules have been synthesized. These large molecular containers, with an inner volume of approximately 1400&#8197;&#197;3, enable the enantioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of terpenes within their interior.







Abstract
Molecular capsules enable the conversion of substrates inside a closed cavity, mimicking to some extent enzymatic catalysis. Chirality transfer from the molecular capsule onto the encapsulated substrate has been only studied in a few cases. Here we demonstrate that chirality transfer is possible inside a rather large molecular container of approximately 1400&#8197;&#197;3. Specifically, we present 1) the first examples of optically active hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules, 2) their ability to enantioselectively catalyze tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclizations, and 3) the surprisingly high sensitivity of enantioselectivity on the structural modifications.

         <title>Integrating Unexpected High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility and Low&#8208;Threshold Lasing Action in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>

An organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2) was designed and synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations demonstrate that LD&#8208;2 combines the properties of high charge carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and superior lasing characteristics (low threshold of Eth=9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Eth=9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the peaks of 420&#8197;nm and 443&#8197;nm), which demonstrates promising potential for integrated optoelectronic device applications.







Abstract
Integrating high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low&#8208;threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor is crucial for the realization of an electrically pumped laser, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an organic semiconductor, named as 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2), which shows an unexpected high charge&#8208;carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low&#8208;threshold lasing characteristic of 9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high&#8208;quality factor (Q) of 2131 and 1684 at emission peaks of 420 and 443&#8197;nm, respectively. Detailed theoretical calculations and photophysical data analysis demonstrate that a large intermolecular transfer integral of 10.36&#8211;45.16&#8197;meV together with a fast radiative transition rate of 8.0&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 are responsible for the achievement of the superior integrated optoelectronic properties in the LD&#8208;2 crystal. These optoelectronic performances of LD&#8208;2 are among the highest reported low&#8208;threshold lasing organic semiconductors with efficient charge transport, suggesting its promise for research of electrically pumped organic lasers (EPOLs).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating high charge-carrier mobility and low-threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor is crucial for the realization of an electrically pumped laser, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an organic semiconductor, named as 2,7-di(2-naphthyl)-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluorene (LD-2), which shows an unexpected high charge-carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low-threshold lasing characteristic of 9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high-quality factor (Q) of 2131 and 1684 at emission peaks of 420 and 443&#8197;nm, respectively. Detailed theoretical calculations and photophysical data analysis demonstrate that a large intermolecular transfer integral of 10.36&#8211;45.16&#8197;meV together with a fast radiative transition rate of 8.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are responsible for the achievement of the superior integrated optoelectronic properties in the LD-2 crystal. These optoelectronic performances of LD-2 are among the highest reported low-threshold lasing organic semiconductors with efficient charge transport, suggesting its promise for research of electrically pumped organic lasers (EPOLs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via a Spin&#8208;Center Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>

A DMAP&#8208;boryl radical breaks the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;O bond of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters via a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) mechanism, enabling the facile conversion of abundantly available and/or naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to value&#8208;added alkylated products.







Abstract
A strategically distinct dehydroxylative alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives with alkenes is developed. The reaction starts with the attack of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom, followed by a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) to trigger the C&#8722;O bond scission. The resulting &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals couple with a wide range of alkenes to furnish various alkylated products. This strategy allows for the efficient conversion of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters derived from several biomass molecules and natural products to value&#8208;added compounds. Experimental and computational studies verified the reaction mechanism.

         <title>LiNbO3&#8208;Type Polar Antiferromagnet InVO3 Synthesized under High&#8208;Pressure Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
InVO3 was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO3&#8208;type structure under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions. The high&#8208;pressure InVO3 phase is a potential multiferroic exhibiting polarization and magnetic ordering.







Abstract
The ambient pressure cation disordered InVO3 bixbyite has been predicted to form a GdFeO3&#8208;type perovskite phase under high pressure and high temperature. Contrary to the expectation, InVO3 was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO3&#8208;type structure with a calculated spontaneous polarization as large as 74&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Antiferromagnetic coupling of V3+ magnetic moments and a cooperative magnetic ground state below about 10&#8197;K coupled with a polar structure suggest an intriguing ground state of the novel LiNbO3&#8208;type high&#8208;pressure InVO3 structure.

         <title>Strong and Reversible Covalent Double Network Hydrogel Based on Force&#8208;Coupled Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction was used to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to create a reversible bond and engineer double network (DN) hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery. The peptide ligase, sortase A (SrtA), can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force and re&#8208;ligation of peptides without force, allowing the sacrificial network in DN hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly.







Abstract
Biological load&#8208;bearing tissues are strong, tough, and recoverable under periodic mechanical loads. However, such features have rarely been achieved simultaneously in the same synthetic hydrogels. Here, we use a force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to a reversible bond. Based on this concept we engineered double network hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery in the same hydrogels. Specifically, we found that a peptide ligase, sortase A, can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force. The peptide bond can be re&#8208;ligated by the same enzyme in the absence of force. This allows the sacrificial network in the double&#8208;network hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly. Our results demonstrate a general approach for precisely controlling the mechanical and dynamic properties of hydrogels at the molecular level.

         <title>A Pd&#8722;H/Isothiourea Cooperative Catalysis Approach to anti&#8208;Aldol Motifs: Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Esters with Oxyallenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 25, June 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperation between isothiourea and Pd catalysts enables the preparation of anti&#8208;aldol products via enantioselective alkylation of esters with oxyallenes. Key to the successful development of this method was the recognition that Pd&#8722;H intermediates could be leveraged within this cooperative framework giving access to oxygen&#8208;substituted &#960;(allyl)Pd intermediates. Preliminary deuterium&#8208;tracking experiments support the proposed reaction pathway.







Abstract
The biological and therapeutic significance of natural products is a powerful impetus for the development of efficient methods to facilitate their construction. Accordingly, and reflecting the prevalence of &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;carbonyl motifs, a sophisticated arsenal of aldol&#8208;based strategies has evolved that is contingent on the generation of single enolate isomers. Since this has the potential to compromise efficiency in reagent&#8208;based paradigms, direct catalysis&#8208;based solutions would be enabling. To complement the array of substrate&#8208;based strategies, and regulate enolate geometry at the catalyst level, a direct catalytic alkylation of esters with oxyallenes has been developed. Synergizing metal hydride reactivity with Lewis base catalysis has resulted in a broad reaction scope with useful levels of stereocontrol (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Facile derivatization of these ambiphilic linchpins is demonstrated, providing access to high&#8208;value vicinal stereocenter&#8208;containing motifs, including 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mutanobactins&#8197;A, B from the Human Microbiome: Macrocyclization and Thiazepanone Assembly in a Single Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The human&#8208;derived lipopeptides mutanobactins&#8197;A, B and D were prepared in a rapid solid&#8208;phase approach, featuring a cascade bicyclization as the last step. Additionally, a thiazepanone amino acid building block for application in analogue synthesis was produced.







Abstract
We report the first total syntheses of tricyclic mutanobactins&#8197;A and B, lipopeptides incorporating a thiazepanone, isolated from Streptococcus mutans, a member of the human oral microbiome. A rapid, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) based route delivers these natural products from a cascade of cyclization reactions. This versatile process was also employed in a streamlined synthesis of mutanobactin&#8197;D. Additionally, we provide an independent synthesis of a truncated mutanobactin&#8197;A analog, utilizing a novel thiazepanone amino acid building block.

         <title>Borylation Directed Borylation of Indoles Using Pyrazabole Electrophiles: A One&#8208;Pot Route to C7&#8208;Borylated&#8208;Indolines.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazabole (  1  ) is a readily accessible diboron compound that can be transformed into ditopic electrophiles. In  1  (and derivatives), the B&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;B separation is ca. 3 &#197;, appropriate for one boron centre bonding to N and one to the C7 of indoles and indolines. This suitable B&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;B separation enables double E&#8208;H (E = N/C) functionalisation of indoles and indolines. Specifically, the activation of  1  with HNTf  2  generates an electrophile that transforms N&#8208;H indoles and indolines into N/C7&#8208;diborylated indolines, with N&#8208;H borylation directing subsequent C7&#8208;H borylation. Indole reduction to indoline occurs before C&#8208;H borylation and our studies indicate this proceeds via hydroboration &#8208; C3&#8208;protodeboronation to produce an intermediate that then undergoes C7 borylation. The borylated products can be converted  in&#8208;situ  into C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;indolines. Overall, this represents a transient directed C&#8208;H borylation to form useful C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;Based Deep Blue&#8208;Emissive Metallacages as Donors for Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report the preparation of a series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)&#8208;based deep blue&#8208;emissive metallacages  via  multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These metallacages feature prismatic structures with HPB derivatives as the faces and tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars, evidenced by NMR, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed by employing the metallacages as the donor and a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, owing to their good spectral overlap. The judiciously chosen metallacage serves as the antenna, providing the suitable energy to excite the non&#8208;emissive NAP and thus offering bright emission for NAP in solid state. This study not only provides a type of HPB&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages but also explores their applications as energy donors to light up non&#8208;emissive fluorophores in the solid state, which will advance the development of emissive metallacages as useful luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high temperature molten oxide electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the ultra&#8211;high temperature electrochemistry (UTE, about &gt;1000  o  C) is emerged, which represents an exploration to extend the temperature limit of human technology in electrochemical engineering.

         <title>Regioselective Fluoroalkylphosphorylation of Unactivated Alkenes by Radical&#8208;Mediated Alkoxyphosphine Rearrangement
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective radical fluoroalkylphosphorylation of unactivated alkenes is developed by a one&#8208;pot reaction of (bis)homoallylic alcohols, phosphine chlorides, and fluoroalkyl iodides under compact fluorescence light (CFL) irradiation. This protocol employs a novel radical rearrangement of alkoxyphosphine to achieve the unusual installing of a phosphoryl in the inner side of the terminal olefins by the dehydroxylative trifunctionalization of (bis)homoallylic alcohols.







Abstract
A novel distal radical rearrangement of alkoxyphosphine is developed for the first time and applied to the regioselective radical fluoroalkylphosphorylation of unactivated olefins. By employing a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction of (bis)homoallylic alcohols, organophosphine chlorides, and fluoroalkyl iodides under CFL (compact fluorescence light) irradiation, a series of fluoroalkylphosphorylated alkyl iodides and alcohols are easily synthesized by regiospecific installing a phosphonyl onto the inner carbon of terminal olefins and further iodination/hydroxylation. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration undergoes a distinctive radical cyclization/&#946;&#8208;scission on the lone electron pair of phosphorus, resulting in C&#8722;P bond formation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Control of Redox&#8208;Active Ester Reactivity Enables a General Cross&#8208;Electrophile Approach to Access Arylated Strained Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained rings are increasingly important for the design of pharmaceutical candidates, but cross&#8208;coupling of strained rings remains challenging. An attractive, but underdeveloped, approach to diverse functionalized carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers is the coupling of abundant strained&#8208;ring carboxylic acids with abundant aryl halides. Herein we disclose the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile approach that couples a variety of strained ring N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters, derived from the carboxylic acid in one step, with various aryl and heteroaryl halides under reductive conditions. The chemistry is enabled by the discovery of methods to control NHP ester reactivity, by tuning the solvent or using modified NHP esters, and the discovery that  t&#8208;Bu  BpyCam  CN  , an L2X ligand, avoids problematic side reactions. This method can be run in flow and in 96&#8208;well plates.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the Bays, Both Ways: A Janus Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Intense NIR&#8208;Emitting Terrylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flying colours: Molecules with intense NIR emission are challenging to achieve. A strategy towards the development of new strongly NIR&#8208;emissive rylene diimides (RDIs) in quantum yields up to 90&#8201;%, having extended conjugation with restricted dynamics is reported. One of the molecules reported here, with conjugated carbazole wings, resembles a Janus butterfly.







Abstract
Molecules with intense near&#8208;IR (NIR) emission are beneficial for modern applications such as night vision, bio&#8208;imaging etc. However, elaborate synthetic manipulations make them demanding to accomplish. Herein, we present a simple yet exciting strategy to obtain novel Janus butterfly&#8208;shaped terrylene diimide derivatives with carbazole wings having absorption and intense emission in the NIR. Especially, unsymmetrically substituted terrylene diimides (TDIs) have been observed to have impressive emission quantum yields (up to 93&#8201;%), highest for this class of compounds. Minimal structural distortion as evidenced from structural characterization has been shown to correlate with these observations. Also, a novel two&#8208;tiered TDI&#8208;carbazole having an intense emission at 897&#8197;nm is also reported. Our strategy demonstrates that efficient near&#8208;IR luminophores can be achieved via precise functionalization.

         <title>Electrolyte Sieving Chemistry in Suppressing Gas Evolution of Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the lifespan and cycling stability of sodium&#8208;metal batteries, the low reactive anion&#8208;mediated solvation structure is well separated from cation&#8208;dominated dilute electrolytes with high gassing reactivity by introducing a zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion&#8208;mediated electrolyte significantly weakens the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the cation in solvation structures, which effectively suppresses the gas evolution between Na metal and ester electrolytes.







Abstract
The sodium (Na)&#8208;metal batteries hold great promise as a sustainable technology owing to the high element abundance and low cost. However, the generally used carbonate electrolytes remain highly reactive towards Na metal, leading to flammable gas evolution. Here, we propose an electrolyte sieving strategy to separate anion&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;pairs from dilute electrolytes by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;pair firstly weakens the electron&#8208;withdrawing property of the cation, which effectively suppresses the gassing. In addition, the sieved electrolyte promotes the formation of robust inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphases. Therefore, it contributes to stable Na plating/stripping in Na|Al half cells with Coulombic efficiency maintaining at 98.5&#8201;% and a long service life of 800&#8197;cycles in full cells. Moreover, the electrode stability is well preserved even under harsh conditions of high temperature and ester&#8208;based electrolytes with higher reactivity.

         <title>Manipulating the Water Dissociation Electrocatalytic Sites of Bimetallic Nickel&#8208;Based Alloys for Highly Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved d&#8208;band model is presented as a valid descriptor to reflect hollow&#8208;site adsorption and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity for multi&#8208;elemental alloy catalysts. NiCu was found to have a near&#8208;optimal &#916;GH value and the introduction of O atoms into the Ni&#8722;Cu surface could accelerate water dissociation. Tailoring electrocatalytic sites for water dissociation can synergistically complete the multi&#8208;step reactions of alkaline HER.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal alloys are currently drawing increasing attention as promising electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, traditional density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory&#8208;derived d&#8208;band theory fails to describe the hydrogen adsorption energy (&#916;GH) on hollow sites. Herein, by studying the &#916;GH for a series of Ni&#8722;M (M=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, W) bimetallic alloys, an improved d&#8208;band center was provided and a potential NiCu electrocatalyst with a near&#8208;optimal &#916;GH was discovered. Moreover, oxygen atoms were introduced into Ni&#8722;M (O&#8722;NiM) to balance the adsorption/desorption of hydroxyl species. The tailored electrocatalytic sites for water dissociation can synergistically accelerate the multi&#8208;step alkaline HER. The prepared O&#8722;NiCu shows the optimum HER activity with a low overpotential of 23&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work not only broadens the applicability of d&#8208;band theory, but also provides crucial understanding for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts.

The prepared O&#8722;NiCu shows the optimum HER activity with a low overpotential of 23&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work not only broadens the applicability of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band theory, but also provides crucial understanding for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pickering Emulsion Catalysis: Interfacial Chemistry, Catalyst Design, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pickering emulsions have emerged as an unconventional catalysis system operated under multiple/complex conditions, which are not possible in most cases for traditional catalysis technologies. This review highlights the mechanism, catalyst design, and the applications of the PIC that have expanded the limit of current catalysis technologies, and will shed a light on the bright future of Pickering emulsion catalysis.







Abstract
Pickering emulsions are particle&#8208;stabilized surfactant&#8208;free dispersions composed of two immiscible liquid phases, and emerge as attractive catalysis platform to surpass traditional technique barrier in some cases. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the development and the catalysis applications of Pickering emulsions since the pioneering work in 2010. The explicit mechanism for Pickering emulsions will be initially discussed and clarified. Then, summarization is given to the design strategy of amphiphilic emulsion catalysts in two categories of intrinsic and extrinsic amphiphilicity. The progress of the unconventional catalytic reactions in Pickering emulsion is further described, especially for the polarity/solubility difference&#8208;driven phase segregation, &#8220;smart&#8221; emulsion reaction system, continuous flow catalysis, and Pickering interfacial biocatalysis. Challenges and future trends for the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis are finally outlined.

         <title>Synthesis of a Negatively Curved Nanocarbon Molecule with an Octagonal Omphalos via Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments Optimizations Supplemented by Machine Learning</title>

         <dc:description>
A 192&#960;&#8208;nanocarbon molecule was contorted by installation of an octagonal omphalos to form a 3&#8208;nm saddle. The omphalos was synthesized via dimerization with the aid of Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments optimizations supplemented by machine&#8208;learning predictions. The saddle was stacked in a dimer by matching contorted surfaces with a negative Gauss curvature.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule was synthesized, which revealed the existence of negative Gauss curvatures on a &gt;3&#8208;nm molecular structure possessing 192 &#960;&#8208;electrons. The synthesis was facilitated by a protocol developed with Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments optimizations and machine&#8208;learning predictions, and spectroscopy and crystallography were used to reveal the saddle&#8208;shaped structure of the molecule. Solution&#8208;phase analyses showed the presence of dimeric assembly, and crystallographic analyses revealed the stacked dimeric structures. The stacked crystal structure was scrutinized by various methods, including Gauss curvatures derived from the discrete surface theory of geometry, to reveal the important role of the molecular Gauss curvature in dimeric assembly.

         <title>&#8220;Like Recycles Like&#8221;: Selective Ring&#8208;Closing Depolymerization of Poly(L&#8208;Lactic Acid) to L&#8208;Lactide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is taken to decrease the ceiling temperature of L&#8208;lactide, enabling chemical recycling of high molecular weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly back to the cyclic lactide monomer (CRM) with high selectivity. By utilizing specific solvent interactions, the CRM can be performed at a moderate temperature; thereby, obstructing side reactions are diminished.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) to the cyclic monomer L&#8208;lactide is hampered by low selectivity and by epimerization and elimination reactions, impeding its use on a large scale. The high number of side reactions originates from the high ceiling temperature (Tc) of L&#8208;lactide, which necessitates high temperatures or multistep reactions to achieve recycling to L&#8208;lactide. To circumvent this issue, we utilized the impact of solvent interactions on the monomer&#8211;polymer equilibrium to decrease the Tc of L&#8208;lactide. Analyzing the observed Tc in different solvents in relation to their Hildebrand solubility parameter revealed a &#8220;like recycles like&#8221; relationship. The decreased Tc, obtained by selecting solvents that interact strongly with the monomer (dimethyl formamide or the green solvent &#947;&#8208;valerolactone), allowed chemical recycling of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly to L&#8208;lactide, within 1&#8211;4&#8197;h at 140&#8201;&#176;C, with &gt;95&#8201;% conversion and 98&#8211;99&#8201;% selectivity. Recycled L&#8208;lactide was isolated and repolymerized with high control over molecular weight and dispersity, closing the polymer loop.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Ligand Targeting the &#946;1&#8208;Adrenoceptor Enables Light&#8208;Control of the Cardiac Rhythm
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New azobenzene&#8208;based molecular photoswitches active for the therapeutic &#946;1&#8208;adrenoceptor (&#946;1&#8208;AR) are presented. The most promising candidate, named pAzo&#8208;2, has a potency and &#946;1/&#946;2 selectivity similar to approved beta blockers. Importantly, pAzo&#8208;2 is compatible with imaging techniques and its potential as a cardioselective light&#8208;controlled drug has been validated by the reversible photomodulation of the cardiac rhythm in living zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
Catecholamine&#8208;triggered &#946;&#8208;adrenoceptor (&#946;&#8208;AR) signaling is essential for the correct functioning of the heart. Although both &#946;1&#8208; and &#946;2&#8208;AR subtypes are expressed in cardiomyocytes, drugs selectively targeting &#946;1&#8208;AR have proven this receptor as the main target for the therapeutic effects of beta blockers in the heart. Here, we report a new strategy for the light&#8208;control of &#946;1&#8208;AR activation by means of photoswitchable drugs with a high level of &#946;1&#8208;/&#946;2&#8208;AR selectivity. All reported molecules allow for an efficient real&#8208;time optical control of receptor function in vitro. Moreover, using confocal microscopy we demonstrate that the binding of our best hit, pAzo&#8208;2, can be reversibly photocontrolled. Strikingly, pAzo&#8208;2 also enables a dynamic cardiac rhythm management on living zebrafish larvae using light, thus highlighting the therapeutic and research potential of the developed photoswitches. Overall, this work provides the first proof of precise control of the therapeutic target &#946;1&#8208;AR in native environments using light.

Overall, this work provides the first proof of precise control of the therapeutic target &#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR in native environments using light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co&#8208;assembled Monolayers as Hole&#8208;Selective Contact for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Optimized Recombination Loss and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient hole selection interface with reduced recombination loss is achieved through co&#8208;assembly of a structurally engineered hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) and an ammonium passivator, with which a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.59&#8201;% and improved device stability are accomplished in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been widely employed as an effective way to modify interfaces of electronic/optoelectronic devices. To achieve a good control of the growth and molecular functionality of SAMs, we develop a co&#8208;assembled monolayer (co&#8208;SAM) for obtaining efficient hole selection and suppressed recombination at the hole&#8208;selective interface in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By engineering the position of methoxy substituents, an aligned energy level and favorable dipole moment can be obtained in our newly synthesized SAM, ((2,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) methyl) phosphonic acid (DC&#8208;PA). An alkyl ammonium containing SAM is co&#8208;assembled to further optimize the surface functionalization and interaction with perovskite layer on top. A champion device with an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.59&#8201;% and improved device stability are achieved. This work demonstrates the advantage of using co&#8208;SAM in improving performance and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions from Aryl Halides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazaphospholene radical chemistry has been made catalytic with a combination of carbonates and phenylsilane as a terminal reductant. The system is suitable for generation of aryl radicals and intermolecular and intramolecular addition of these radicals.







Abstract
Diazaphospholenes are widely used as hydride transfer catalysts, however their use in radical reactions is a recently emerging area. Here, we show prior stoichiometric radical cyclizations of aryl iodides mediated by diazaphospholene hydrides are made catalytic by the combination of phenylsilane and alkali metal salts to regenerate the diazaphospholene hydride. The scope was expanded to include aryl bromides, which benefit from visible light irradiation. Twenty one substrates underwent cyclization, including a dearomative cyclization. Extension to six intermolecular radical hydroarylations with arenes, thiophenes, and a pyridine was also accomplished.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Intermolecular Hydrosilylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Prochiral Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intermolecular hydrosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes promoted by an easily accessible Co complex to afford a wide range of enantioenriched acyclic silanes was developed. This protocol represents the first intermolecular example of simultaneous construction of a C&#8208; and a Si&#8208;stereogenic center through metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.







Abstract
One of the most straightforward approaches to access chiral silanes is catalytic enantioselective hydrosilylation. Although significant advances have been achieved in enantioselective construction of either a carbon&#8208;stereogenic center or a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center through enantioselective hydrosilylation, simultaneous establishment of a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in an acyclic molecule through a single intermolecular hydrosilylation remained undeveloped. Herein, an unprecedented cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes is presented, enabling construction of a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in a single intermolecular transformation. A wide range of chiral silanes bearing a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center were generated in high efficiency and stereoselectivity. Functionalization of the enantioenriched silanes delivered a variety of valuable chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access.

A facile synthetic route towards a series of novel [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived ligands (UCD&#8208;IMPHANOL) possessing central chirality and planar chirality has been developed. These ligands demonstrated excellent enantioselectivities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition.







Abstract
We present a facile synthetic route toward a novel series of imidazolinyl&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophanol (UCD&#8208;Imphanol) ligands possessing central and planar chirality. Both sets of diastereomeric ligands were successfully purified by column chromatography. The preliminary application of this family of ligands showed excellent activities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition. Enantioenriched pyrrolidines, in a substrate scope of 20 examples, were accessed in high levels of endo/exo ratios (up to &gt;99/1) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) with excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) by using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol/(S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.

         <title>A DNA Barcode&#8208;Based Aptasensor Enables Rapid Testing of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Viruses in Swine Saliva Using Electrochemical Readout</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, simple, and reagent&#8208;less dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) was developed using a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). This biosensor demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 83&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% using 12 porcine saliva samples with a concordance value of 92&#8201;% at an analysis time of one hour.







Abstract
Pen&#8208;side testing of farm animals for infectious diseases is critical for preventing transmission in herds and providing timely intervention. However, most existing pathogen tests have to be conducted in centralized labs with sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times of 2&#8211;4&#8197;days. Herein we introduce a test that uses a dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) and a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for rapid on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). The sensor exploits inter&#8208;electrode spacing reduction and active field mediated transport to accelerate barcode movement from electroactive aptamers to the detection electrode, thus expediting assay operation. The test yielded a clinically relevant limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6&#8197;nM (0.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) in saliva&#8208;spiked PEDv samples. Clinical evaluation of this biosensor with 12 porcine saliva samples demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 83&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% with a concordance value of 92&#8201;% at an analysis time of one hour.

         <title>Polymer Nanoparticles with Uniform Monomer Sequences for Sequence&#8208;Specific Peptide Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoparticles with uniform monomer sequences for target recognition were synthesized for the first time by polymerizing nanoparticles in the presence of sequence&#8208;precise oligomers. The oligomers cooperatively recognized the amino acid sequence of the target peptide and neutralized its toxicity. This is the first step towards achieving a &#8220;monoclonal plastic antibody&#8221;, a synthetic polymer with a uniform monomer sequence for target&#8208;specific neutralization.







Abstract
Synthetic polymer nanoparticles (NPs) that recognize and neutralize target biomacromolecules are of considerable interest as &#8220;plastic antibodies&#8221;, synthetic mimics of antibodies. However, monomer sequences in the synthetic NPs are heterogeneous. The heterogeneity limits the target specificity and safety of the NPs. Herein, we report the synthesis of NPs with uniform monomer sequences for recognition and neutralization of target peptides. A multifunctional oligomer with a precise monomer sequence that recognizes the target peptide was prepared via cycles of reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and flash chromatography. The oligomer or blend of oligomers was used as a chain transfer agent and introduced into poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) hydrogel NPs by radical polymerization. Evaluation of the interaction with the peptides revealed that multiple oligomers in NPs cooperatively recognized the sequence of the target peptide and neutralized its toxicity. Effect of sequence, combination, density and molecular weight distribution of precision oligomers on the affinity to the peptides was also investigated.

         <title>Template Guided Regioselective Encaging of Platinum Single Atoms into Y Zeolite: Enhanced Selectivity in Semihydrogenation and Resistance to Poisoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to localize single metal atoms at target sites of zeolite with uniform coordination environment. In this study, single platinum atoms were selectively encaged into six&#8208;membered rings of sodalite (SOD) cages within Y zeolite through a template guiding strategy, in which, during in situ synthesis process, template molecules were designed to occupy supercages, thus to enforce coordinated platinum species involved into SOD cages, and then, followed by control of post&#8208;treatment condition to obtain this Y zeolite selectively encaged single platinum atoms catalyst (denoted as Pt@Y&#8208;SOD). In addition to show good stability and excellent catalytic selectivity in semihydrogenation reaction, Pt@Y&#8208;SOD catalyst also exhibited interesting thiophene&#8208;resistance and carbon monoxide&#8208;resistance abilities in this transformation, as a result of the unique configuration of encaged single platinum atoms to weaken the interactions with these poisons.</dc:description>

         <title>Working Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries at 80oC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries possess inherent safety and are especially commendable facing high&#8208;temperature working conditions. However, their working feasibility at high temperatures has seldom been investigated. Herein, the working feasibility of high&#8208;temperature zinc&#8211;air batteries is systemically investigated. The effects of temperature on air cathode, zinc anode, and aqueous electrolyte are decoupled to identify the favorable and unfavorable factors. Specifically, parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction strengthens at high temperatures and leads to declined anode Faraday efficiency, which is identified as the main bottleneck. Moreover, zinc&#8211;air batteries demonstrate cycling feasibility at 80  o  C. This work reveals the potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries to satisfy energy storage at high temperatures and guides further development of advanced batteries towards harsh working conditions.</dc:description>

Active droplets exhibit self&#8208;propulsion and pairwise repulsion due to solubilization processes and/or solubilization products raising the droplet&#8217;s interfacial tension. Here, we report emulsions with the opposite behavior, wherein solubilization decreases the interfacial tension and causes droplets to attract. We characterize the influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221; or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified. We believe these studies contribute to a fundamental understanding of solubilization processes in emulsions and provide guidance as to how chemical parameters can influence the dynamics and chemotactic interactions between active droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Metal&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymer for Low Flicker AC&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free nonconjugated long&#8208;persistent luminescent copolymer that exhibits excellent optical stability under high temperature and high humidity was designed and characterized. Long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) is clearly observed at 353&#8197;K and the copolymer can be excited by ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared irradiation. The high initial LPL intensity with an ultrafast filling time significantly reduces flicker in alternating current driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs) to 63.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescent materials are promising light&#8208;emitting materials for encryption, architectural decoration, organic solar cells, and biomedical applications. However, their unstable structures and thermal&#8208; and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free nonconjugated copolymer that possesses stable photoluminescence at both high temperature and humidity. The room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of this copolymer lasts for more than 15&#8197;s and can be recovered in high humidity conditions by heating to remove moisture. Copolymer LPL can be achieved with various excitation wavelengths, ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and the LPL color can be adjusted accordingly. The high initial LPL intensity and ultrafast filling time of the copolymer makes it suitable for low flicker alternating current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs).

         <title>Molecular Inhibition for Selective CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction presents a sustainable route to the production of chemicals and fuels. Achieving a narrow product distribution with heterogeneous Cu catalysts is challenging and conventional material modifications offer limited control over selectivity. Here, we show that surface&#8208;immobilised molecular species can act as inhibitors for specific carbon products to provide rational control over product distributions. Combined experimental and computational results showed that anchoring of a thiol&#8209;functionalised pyridine on Cu destabilises a surface&#8209;bound reaction intermediate to energetically block a CO&#8209;producing pathway, thereby favouring formate production. The nitrogen atom was shown to be essential to the inhibition mechanism. The ability of molecules to control selectivity through inhibition of specific reaction pathways offers a unique approach to rationally modify heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Reverse Sequence Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new aqueous polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) formulation that enables the hydrophobic block to be prepared first when targeting diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects. This counter&#8208;intuitive reverse sequence approach uses an ionic RAFT agent for the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) to produce charge&#8208;stabilized latex particles. Chain extension using a water&#8208;soluble methacrylic, acrylic or acrylamide comonomer then produces sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles in an aqueous one&#8208;pot formulation. In each case, the monomer diffuses into the PHPMA particles, which act as the locus for the polymerization. A remarkable change in morphology occurs as the ~600 nm latex is converted into much smaller sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which exhibit thermoresponsive behavior. Such reverse sequence PISA formulations enable the efficient synthesis of new functional diblock copolymer nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Structurally unique natural products pose biosynthetic puzzles whose solution can inspire new chemical reactions. Herein, we propose a unified biosynthetic pathway towards some complex meroterpenoids &#8211; the hyperireflexolides, biyoulactones, hybeanones and hypermonones. This hypothesis led to the discovery of uncatalyzed, intramolecular carbonyl&#8208;ene reactions that are spontaneous at room temperature.

         <title>Thermally activated and aggregation&#8208;regulated excitonic coupling enable emissive high&#8208;lying triplet excitons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) originating from higher&#8208;lying triplet excitons remains a rather rarely documented occurrence for purely organic molecular systems. Here, we report two naphthalene&#8208;based RTP luminophores whose phosphorescence emission is enabled by radiative decay of high&#8208;lying triplet excitons. In contrast, upon cooling the dominant phosphorescence originates from the lowest&#8208;lying triplet excited state, which is manifested by a red&#8208;shifted emission. Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that the unusual RTP results from thermally activated excitonic coupling between different conformations of the compounds. Aggregation&#8208;regulated excitonic coupling is observed when increasing the doping concentration of the emitters in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). Further, the RTP quantum efficiency improves more than 80&#8208;fold in 1,3&#8208;bis(  N  &#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) compared to that in PMMA. This design principle offers important insight into triplet excited state dynamics and has been exploited in afterglow&#8208;indicating temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical carrier doping of molecular Mott insulators has been poorly investigated to date due to its difficulty. In this study, iodine doping of a molecular Mott insulator, lithium phthalocyanine crystallized in the x&#8208;form (x&#8208;LiPc), was performed to obtain metallic x&#8208;LiPcI. Crystal structure analysis revealed that iodine atoms penetrated channels of x&#8208;LiPc and formed one&#8208;dimensional chains. The Raman spectroscopy of x&#8208;LiPcI indicated the existence of linear&#160; I  5  &#8211;  , demonstrating a transition from a half&#8208;filled band of the Mott insulating state to a 2/5&#8208;filled band of the metallic state . Electrical resistivity measurements confirmed the metallic nature of x&#8208;LiPcI, whereas a thermally activated behavior was observed for pristine x&#8208;LiPc. Furthermore, the x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator was reproduced by dedoping iodine from x&#8208;LiPcI, suggesting that the electronic state can be reversibly tuned between the Mott insulating and metallic states by chemical doping and dedoping.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tool in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. In this article, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Eu2P2S6: The First Rare&#8208;Earth Chalcogenophosphate Exhibiting Large Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response and High Laser&#8208;Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal chalcogenophosphates are receiving increasing interest, specifically as promising infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) candidates. Here, a rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphate Eu2P2S6 crystallizing in the monoclinic noncentrosymmetric space group Pn was synthesized using a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure features isolated [P2S6]4&#8722; dimer, and two types of EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. Eu2P2S6 exhibits a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response ~0.9 &#215; AgGaS2@2.1 &#956;m, and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4 &#215; AgGaS2, representing the first rare&#8208;earth NLO chalcogenophosphate. The theoretical calculation result suggests that the SHG response is ascribed to the synergetic contribution of [P2S6]4&#8722; dimers and EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. This work provides not only a promising high&#8208;performance infrared NLO material, but also open the avenue for exploring rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphates as potential IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice enables double&#8208;high activity and reversibility of anion redox for sodium&#8208;ion battery layered cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion redox contributes to the anomalous capacity exceeding theoretical limit of layered oxides. However, double&#8208;high activity and reversibility is challenging due to the structural rearrangement and potential oxygen loss. Here, we propose a strategy of constructing dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice structure in Na  2/3  [Li  1/7  Mn  5/14  ][Mg  1/7  Mn  5/14  ]O  2  to simultaneously realize high activity and reversibility of lattice O redox. Theoretical simulation and electrochemical tests show that  [Li  1/7  Mn  5/14  ] superlattice units remarkably trigger the anion redox activity  and enable to deliver a record capacity of 285.9 mA g  &#8208;1  in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Nuclear magnetic resonance and  in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that [Mg  1/7  Mn  5/14  ] superlattice units are beneficial to the structure and anion redox reversibility  , where Li  +  reversibly shuttles between Na layers and transition&#8208;metal slabs  in contrast to the absence of [Mg  1/7  Mn  5/14  ]  units. Our findings underline the importance of multifunctional units and provide a path to advanced battery materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nearly&#160;Unity Quantum Yield Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Heavy Atom&#8208;Free Rigid Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergism between covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds is employed to fix an organic phosphor guest in a rigid inorganic framework, simulating the stiffening effect seen in the glassy state and realizing efficient and ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Twelve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free composites have been obtained through introducing arylboric or arylcarboxylic acid derivatives into the inorganic boric acid matrix by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Owing to the stiffening effect of multiple bonds, all the composites show highly&#8208;efficient and persistent RTP of guest molecules with quantum yield ranging from 39.8% to ca. 100% and lifetime up to 8.74 s, which results in a 55 s afterglow visible to naked eyes after exposure to a portable UV lamp. Interestingly, it is found that the substitution position and quantity of carboxyl in guest have a great influence on the phosphorescent properties, and that the heavy&#8208;atom effect is invalid in such host&#8208;guest hybrid systems. The 100 g grade composite is easily prepared because of the solvent&#8208;free, green, and simple synthesis method. These results provide an important way for the development of RTP materials with ultrahigh quantum yield and ultralong lifetime, as well as their practical applications in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage, among others.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation of alkenes. However, important limitations in term of structural diversity and handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur&#8208;centered radicals to achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system were finally evaluated in a (3+2)&#8208;radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and olefins.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is the most attractive strategy to develop chemically recyclable polymers to establish a circular plastic economy. Despite the recent advancements, the chemically recyclable polymers still face challenges including high energy cost for polymer preparation or recycling, poor monomer recovery selectivity and efficiency as well as undesired material performances. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce exclusive functionalizable polyester using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained polyester with high molar mass exhibits good tensile strength comparable to that of some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained polyester can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a 96% yield by thermolysis, thus successfully establishing a close&#8208;loop life cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence or Phosphorescence? The Metallic Composition of the Nanocluster Kernel Does Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic compositions of nanoclusters can dictate whether their photoluminescence is fluorescence or phosphorescence. This effect is demonstrated with Au5Ag11 and Pt1Ag16 nanoclusters that have comparable structures but different compositions.







Abstract
It remains challenging to manipulate the nature of photoluminescence as either fluorescence or phosphorescence for a correlated cluster series. In this work, two correlated nanoclusters, Au5Ag11(SR)8(DPPOE)2 and Pt1Ag16(SR)8(DPPOE)2 with comparable structure features, were synthesized and structurally determined. These two alloy nanoclusters displayed distinct photoluminescent nature&#8212;the Au5Ag11 nanocluster is fluorescent, whereas the Pt1Ag16 nanocluster is phosphorescent. The decay processes of the excited electrons in these two nanoclusters have been explicitly mapped out by both experimental and theoretical approaches, disclosing the mechanisms of their fluorescence and phosphorescence. Specifically, the metallic compositions of the nanocluster kernels mattered in determining their photoluminescent nature. The results herein provide an intriguing nanomodel that enables us to grasp the origin of photoluminescence at the atomic level, which further paves the way for fabricating novel nanoclusters or cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with customized photophysical properties.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Biocatalytic Synthesis of Sustainable Surfactants by Selective Amide Bond Formation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic route to commercially important surfactants is presented. A truncated construct of carboxylic acid reductase (CARmm&#8208;A) catalyzes amide bond formation between fatty acids and amino alcohols with no esterification observed. The wide substrate scope of the enzyme, co&#8208;factor recycling, reaction engineering and up&#8208;scaling show the feasibility of this method for synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkanoyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylglucamides (MEGAs) are non&#8208;toxic surfactants widely used as commercial ingredients, but more sustainable syntheses towards these compounds are highly desirable. Here, we present a biocatalytic route towards MEGAs and analogues using a truncated carboxylic acid reductase construct tailored for amide bond formation (CARmm&#8208;A). CARmm&#8208;A is capable of selective amide bond formation without the competing esterification reaction observed in lipase catalysed reactions. A kinase was implemented to regenerate ATP from polyphosphate and by thorough reaction optimisation using design of experiments, the amine concentration needed for amidation was significantly reduced. The wide substrate scope of CARmm&#8208;A was exemplified by the synthesis of 24 commercially relevant amides, including selected examples on a preparative scale. This work establishes acyl&#8208;phosphate mediated chemistry as a highly selective strategy for biocatalytic amide bond formation in the presence of multiple competing alcohol functionalities.

         <title>Chiral Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters Exhibiting Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with an EQE of 37.2&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of central chirality and multi&#8208;resonance framework derives a set of chiral enantiomers concurrently featuring narrowband emission and circularly polarized (CP) thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Owing to high rigidity and quasi&#8208;planarity of the skeleton, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%, a FWHM of 30&#8197;nm, as well as a high horizontal dipole orientation of 90&#8201;% are acquired in the doped film. Corresponding CP&#8208;OLEDs manifest a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency up to 37.2&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence.







Abstract
Highly efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters with narrowband emission remain a formidable challenge for circularly polarized OLEDs (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a promising strategy for developing chiral emitters concurrently featuring multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is demonstrated by the integration of molecular rigidity, central chirality and MR effect. A pair of chiral green emitters denoted as (R)&#8208;BN&#8208;MeIAc and (S)&#8208;BN&#8208;MeIAc is designed. Benefited by the rigid and quasi&#8208;planar MR&#8208;framework, the enantiomers not only display mirror&#8208;image CPL spectra, but also exhibit TADF properties with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%, a narrow FWHM of 30&#8197;nm, and a high horizontal dipole orientation of 90&#8201;% in the doped film. Consequently, the enantiomer&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 37.2&#8201;% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off, representing the highest device efficiency of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifted Water&#8208;Soluble BODIPY Photocages for Visualisation and Controllable Cellular Delivery of Signaling Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY photocages are presented. They can selectively target inner or outer cell membranes and release signaling lipids upon red&#8208;light illumination, inducing Ca2+ signaling. The solvent&#8208;dependent uncaging mechanism and orthogonal uncaging in the presence of a coumarin&#8208;caged lipid is reported.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a water&#8208;soluble caging group based on a &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY scaffold able to release carboxylate&#8208;containing cargo upon red light illumination (&#955;irr=633&#8197;nm). We performed mechanistic studies showing new insights into the principles of the photoreactivity of these cages and demonstrated a significant influence of the structure of a carboxylate cargo on the rate and efficiency of the uncaging process and its side reactions. We used it for selective delivery, visualisation, and photorelease of a signaling lipid in cell plasma and internal membranes. With this approach, we successfully induced Ca2+ release in cells expressing the GPR40 receptor.

         <title>The Intrinsic Role of the Fusion Mode and Electron&#8208;Deficient Core in Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core have different effects in the A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A acceptors. The angular fusion is beneficial to enhance light absorption and reduce electron&#8208;vibration couplings to simultaneously accelerate exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport, while introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core will lead to deeper frontier orbitals, bathochromic absorption, and further promote exciton dissociation.







Abstract
The A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors with an angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core has significantly boosted organic photovoltaic efficiency. Here, the intrinsic role of the peculiar structure is revealed by comparing representative A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A acceptor Y6 with its A&#8208;D&#8208;A counterparts having different fusion modes. Owing to the more delocalized HOMO and deeper LUMO level, Y6 exhibits stronger and red&#8208;shifted absorption relative to the linear and angular fused A&#8208;D&#8208;A acceptors, respectively. Moreover, the change from linear to angular fusion substantially reduces the electron&#8208;vibration couplings, which is responsible for the faster exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport for Y6 than the linear fused A&#8208;D&#8208;A acceptor. Notably, the electron&#8208;vibration coupling for exciton dissociation is further decreased by introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core, thus contributing to the efficient charge generation under low driving forces in the Y6&#8208;based devices.

The angular fusion is beneficial to enhance light absorption and reduce electron-vibration couplings to simultaneously accelerate exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport, while introducing the electron-deficient core will lead to deeper frontier orbitals, bathochromic absorption, and further promote exciton dissociation.

         <title>The Microscopic Diamond Anvil Cell: Stabilization of Superhard, Superconducting Carbon Allotropes at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an  sp  3  carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel cis&#8208;polyacetylene chains. The distance between these  sp  2  carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well&#8208;nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the  sp  2  carbons being key contributors to the electron phonon coupling. The  sp  3  carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48 GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on&#8208;surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the  sp  2  versus  sp  3  carbon content, and by doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore&#8208;Structure Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)&#160;for Capture of the Greenhouse Gas SF6 with Record Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the electronics industry, the efficient recovery and capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is of great importance. Herein, three metal&#8208;organic frameworks with fine&#8208;tuning pore structures, Cu(peba)2, Ni(pba)2, and Ni(ina)2, were designed for SF6 capture. Among them, Ni(ina)2 has perfect pore sizes (6 &#197;) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2 &#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF6 gas. Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest SF6/N2 selectivity (375.1 at 298 K and 1 bar) and ultra&#8208;high SF6 uptake capacity (53.5 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 0.1 bar) at ambient conditions.&#160;The remarkable separation performance of Ni(ina)2 was verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations and the SF6&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structure provided critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. This porous coordination network has the potential to be used in industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Proton&#8208;feeding Effect in Sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doping in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is considered a powerful strategy to promote electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the origin of enhanced catalytic activity is still elusive. Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton&#8208;feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in second&#8208;shell of FeN4 (Fe1&#8208;NSC) was verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe1&#8208;NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur&#8208;free FeN4 and most reported Fe&#8208;based SAC, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6% and turnover frequency of 1197 h&#8208;1. Kinetic analysis and in&#8208;situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient proton for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.</dc:description>

By meticulously installing an imide group onto fluorene and its cyanated derivative, we report here two very electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, imide&#8208;functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI), both featuring a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level down to &#8208;4.05 eV and highly coplanar framework, endowing them ideal units for constructing n&#8208;type polymers. Thus, a series of polymers are built from them, exhibiting unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a highest electron mobility of 0.11 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1.

The reactivity shunt upon oxidation of&#160;2&#160;to&#160;3&#160;confirms an umpolung of the imido ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms for heterogeneous tethering of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Yet, to further understand electrocatalytic MOF systems, one also needs to consider their capability to fine&#8208;tune the immediate chemical environment of the active site, and thus affect its overall catalytic operation. here, we show that electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities enable substantial improvement of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity and selectivity. In&#8208;situ Raman analysis reveal that immobilization of pendent positively&#8208;charged groups adjacent to MOF&#8208;residing Fe&#8208;porphyrin catalysts, stabilize weakly&#8208;bound CO intermediates, allowing their rapid release as catalytic products. Also, by varying the electrolyte&#8217;s ionic strength, systematic regulation of electrostatic field magnitude was achieved, resulting in essentially 100% CO selectivity. Thus, this concept provides a sensitive molecular&#8208;handle that adjust heterogenous electrocatalysis on demand.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediating CO2 Electroreduction Activity and Selectivity over Atomically Precise Copper Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;based nanoclusters (NCs) are highly desirable catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their abundance and high reactivity. In particular, atomically precise copper clusters can provide an ideal platform for correlating the structure and catalytic behaviour at the atomic level. However, systematic comparative studies of Cu cluster isomers (comprising the same number of metal atoms) with well&#8208;defined compositions and structures for electrocatalytic CO2RR are still lacking due to synthetic challenges. Herein, a group of structurally precise Cu8  cluster isomers with different core structures and peripheral ligands (a cube&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;1 cluster stapled with a 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;9&#8208;carbodithioate ligand and ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;2 and Cu8&#8208;3 clusters stapled with 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;9&#8208;carbodithioate or  O&#8208;ethyl carbonodithioate and  tBuS&#8208;  ligands) was developed and investigated for highly active and selective CO2  reduction. Electrocatalytic measurements showed a significant difference in catalytic CO2RR activity and selectivity for Cu8  clusters with different kernel packing and surface structures. Ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;2 exhibited a higher Faradaic efficiency of approximately 92% at &#8208;1.0 V (vs. RHE) for the conversion of CO2  to HCOOH and higher selectivity than the cube&#8208;shaped Cu8&#8208;1 cluster. Theoretical investigations revealed the different levels of competitiveness with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the respective core&#8208;shaped Cu8  clusters, as well as the decreased free energies for the adsorbed HCOO* intermediates that had formed on the ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8  clusters for high activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

Electrocatalytic measurements showed a significant difference in catalytic CO2RR activity and selectivity for Cu8  clusters with different kernel packing and surface structures. Ditetrahedron-shaped Cu8-2 exhibited a higher Faradaic efficiency of approximately 92% at -1.0 V (vs. RHE) for the conversion of CO2  to HCOOH and higher selectivity than the cube-shaped Cu8-1 cluster.

         <title>Aminal&#8208;linked Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Rapid Photocatalytic Decontamination of Mustard&#8208;Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are appealing photocatalysts for toxic chemical degradation. Great efforts have been devoted to regulate the photocatalytic performance of COFs by tuning their organic building blocks, but the relationship between COF linkage and photochemical properties has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrinic COF, namely Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF. Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF (0.25 mol%) showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant with a half&#8208;life (t  1/2  ) of 5 min, which is far lower than that of traditional imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF (t  1/2  = 16 min). Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the aminal linkages of Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF facilitated the intersystem crossing process. Thus, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF showed higher triplet&#8208;state generation efficiency compared with Por&#8208;COF, consequently promoting the activation of oxygen molecular to singlet oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing ring complexation for efficient capturing and detection of small gaseous molecules using SERS for environmental surveillance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains challenging due to poor analyte affinity to SERS substrate. The reported use of capturing probes suffers from concurrent inconsistent signals and long response time due to formation of multiple potential probe&#8208;analyte interaction orientations. Here, we demonstrate the use of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions for ring complexation to boost the affinity of small gas molecules, SO  2  and NO  2  , to our SERS platform, achieving rapid capture and multiplex detection down to 100 ppm. Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies affirm stable ring complex formation, and kinetic investigations reveal a 4&#8208;fold faster response time compared to probes without stable ring complexation capability. By synergizing spectral concatenation and support vector machine regression, we achieve 91.7% accuracy for multiplex quantification of SO  2  and NO  2  in excess CO  2  , mimicking real&#8208;life exhausts. Our platform shows immense potential for on&#8208;site exhaust and air quality surveillance.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Metal Speciation in Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Complexes by IMS&#8208;MS: Application to the Detection of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimics in Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection and quantification of exogenous metal complexes are crucial to understanding their activity in complex biological media. Mn(II) complexes are difficult to detect and quantify because of low association constants, high lability, and fast metal exchange. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic (or mimetic) labelled Mn1 is based on a 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aminoethane functionalized with imidazole and phenolate and has good intrinsic anti&#8208;superoxide, antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;activated intestinal epithelial HT29&#8208;MD2 cells, similar to that of its propylated analogue labelled Mn1P. Ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) is a powerful technique for separating low molecular weight (LMW) metal complexes and can even separate complexes with the same ligand but bound to different divalent metal cations with similar ionic radii. We  demonstrated the intracellular presence of the Mn1 and Mn1P complexes, at least partly intact, in lysates of cells  incubated with the complexes and estimated the intracellular Mn1P concentration using a Co&#8208;  13  C  6  analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Shell Engineering of a Au28 Nanocluster Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly impart their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal core but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au  28  (C  2  B  10  H  11  S)  12  (tht)  4  Cl  4  (  Au  28  &#8208;S  ), was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis.  Au  28  &#8208;S  adopts an identical Au  28  metal framework with the reported alkynyl&#8208;protected  Au  28  &#8208;C  . The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore,  Au  28  &#8208;S  shows more excellent catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  to CO.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly impart their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal core but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au  28  (C  2  B  10  H  11  S)  12  (tht)  4  Cl  4  (  Au  28  -S  ), was isolated by a facile self-reducing synthesis.  Au  28  -S  adopts an identical Au  28  metal framework with the reported alkynyl-protected  Au  28  -C  . The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore,  Au  28  -S  shows more excellent catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  to CO. Theoretical calculations identified the active sites and shed light on the catalytic mechanism to elucidate the different catalytic performances. This work provides an ideal platform to study the protective layer-activity relationship of gold NCs, and may also provide guidance in the design of metal NC-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,5&#8208;Allyl Shift by a&#160;Sequential Achmatowicz/Oxonia&#8208;Cope/Retro&#8208;Achmatowicz&#160;Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Allyl and 1,2&#8208;allyl shifts through [3,3]&#8208; and [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements are well&#8208;established and widely used in organic synthesis. In contrast, 1,5&#8208;allyl shift through related [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is unknown because [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann forbidden. Herein, we report an unexpected discovery of a 1,5&#8208;allyl shift of allyl furfuryl alcohol. Mechanistically, this 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is achieved by two steps through sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangements: 1) Achmatowicz rearrangement (AchR, ring expansion), and 2) cascade oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement/retro&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring contraction). This new 1,5&#8208;allyl shift method is demonstrated with &gt;20 examples and expected to find applications in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at Electron&#8208;Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8208;C Coupling via&#160;a Carboranyl Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of carborane in a vertex&#8208;specific manner is a perennial challenge. Here, we report a photocatalytic B&#8208;C coupling for selective functionalization of carboranes at the boron site which is most distal to carbon. This reaction protocol was achieved by photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that the reaction more easily occurs at the boron site bearing higher electron density owing to the lower energy barrier for a single electron transfer to generate a carboranyl radical. By using this strategy, a number of functionalized carboranes through alkylation, alkenylation, and heteroarylation could be accessed under mild conditions. Moreover, both a highly efficient blue emitter with the solid&#8208;state luminous efficiency of 42% and a Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) drug candidate containing targeting and fluorine units were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Homochiral Multiferroic Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Dimetallic Complexes Assembled by C&#8211;F&#183;&#183;&#183;K Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes have attracted substantial attention due to the variety of structures with various interesting properties. However, the homochiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are rare, and endowing them with ferroelectricity has long been a great challenge. Here, through the introduction of C&#8211;F&#183;&#183;&#183;K interactions between the guest chiral cations and the host [KFe(CN)  6  ]  2&#8211;  framework, we design three&#8208;dimensional cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic multiferroics, [  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium]  2  [KFe(CN)  6  ] (  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;3&#8208;FPC). The mirror&#8208;symmetric vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) signal demonstrates their enantiomeric feature.  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;3&#8208;FPC crystallize in the same chiral&#8208;polar space group  P  2  1  at 298 K. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), polarizing optical microscopy, and temperature&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements demonstrate their multiferroic properties that is the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity, in line with the Aizu notation of 222F2. Importantly, the  R  &#8208;3&#8208;FPC shows excellent ferroelectricity with saturated polarization up to 9.4  &#956;  C/cm  2  , much higher than those of other cyanido&#8208;bridged ferroelectrics. This work provides a viable way to design chiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic ferroelectrics and multiferroics.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Red&#8208;Shifted Phosphorescence from Triphenylamines: Triplet Excimer or Impurity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TPA) was reported to exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence, where the red&#8208;shifted band was assigned as the excimeric phosphorescence with an energy shift of &gt; 3,000 cm&#8208;1 (J. Phys. Chem., 1991, 95, 7189). Here we show that purified TPA (purity: &gt;99.97%) shows a single phosphorescence band with a small energy shift of &lt; 200 cm&#8208;1 under the same experimental condition. The new experimental results, along with theoretical calculations, suggest that the previously reported triplet excimer of TPA is probably not valid and is most likely due to an unidentified impurity. As&#8208;received TPA samples, however, do exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence bands, and the wavelength, relative intensity, and temperature dependence of the lower&#8208;energy phosphorescence band vary significantly depending on dopant structures. It was found that dopant phosphorescence could still become dominant even in dilute third&#8208;party solutions of the host at low temperature.</dc:description>
