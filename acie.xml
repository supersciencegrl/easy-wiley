      <title>Rational Construction of Borromean Linked Crystalline Organic Polymers</title>

      <title>The Trojan Horse Goes Wild: The Effect of Drug Loading on the Behavior of Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Drug delivery is often compared to a Trojan Horse, as the drugs are hidden inside nanoparticles (equivalent to the Trojan Horse) and they enter cells (e.g. cancer cells) in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. However, it seems that drug loading can influence the properties of the nanoparticles, which are detected by the cell. As a result, the cell can reject the nanoparticle; thus, loading large amounts of drugs can be damaging to drug delivery efforts.







Abstract
Drug delivery with nanoparticles is sometimes compared to an attack with a Trojan Horse. The drugs are hidden in nanoparticles and enter the unsuspecting cells in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. Here, I would like to share my thoughts that a comparison to the Trojan Horse does not always apply, and provide examples where an increased drug loading content was detrimental to the drug&#8208;delivery process. The purpose is to highlight the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and the importance of having materials scientists in the line&#8208;up of researchers working together to create successful nanomedicine.

      <title>Photoacoustic Cavitation&#8208;Ignited Reactive Oxygen Species to Amplify Peroxynitrite Burst by Photosensitization&#8208;free Polymeric Nanocapsules</title>
      <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) technology can transform light energy into acoustic wave   , which  can be used for either imaging or therapy that depends on the power density of pulsed laser. Here, we report photosensitizer&#8208;free polymeric nanocapsules loaded with nitric oxide (NO) donors, namely NO&#8208;NCPs, formulated from  NIR light&#8208;absorbable amphiphilic polymers  and a NO&#8208;releasing donor, DETA NONOate. Controlled NO release and nanocapsule dissociation are achieved in acidic lysosomes of cancer cells. More importantly, upon pulsed laser irradiation, the PA cavitation can excite water to generate significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical (O  2  &#8226;&#8208;  ), which further spontaneously reacts with the  in&#8208;situ  released NO to burst highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO  &#8208;  ) in cancer cells. The resultant ONOO  &#8208;  generation greatly promotes mitochondrial damage and DNA fragmentation to initiate programmed cancer cell death. Apart from PA imaging, PA cavitation can intrinsically amplify reactive species via photosensitization&#8208;free materials for promising disease theranostics.</dc:description>

      <title>Isolation and Reactivity of an s&#8208;Block Metal Antiaromatic</title>
      <dc:description>The concepts of aromaticity and antiaromaticity have a long history, and countless demonstrations of these phenomena have been made with molecules based on elements from the p, d and f blocks of the periodic table. However, the limited oxidation&#8208;state flexibility of the s&#8208;block metals has long stood in the way of their participation in sophisticated &#960;&#8208;bonding arrangements, and truly antiaromatic systems containing s&#8208;block metals are altogether absent or remain poorly defined. Using spectroscopic, structural, and computational techniques, we present herein the synthesis and authentication of a heterocyclic compound containing the alkaline earth metal beryllium that exhibits significant antiaromaticity, and detail its chemical reduction and Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;coordination chemistry.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The concepts of aromaticity and antiaromaticity have a long history, and countless demonstrations of these phenomena have been made with molecules based on elements from the p, d and f blocks of the periodic table. However, the limited oxidation&#8208;state flexibility of the s&#8208;block metals has long stood in the way of their participation in sophisticated &#960;&#8208;bonding arrangements, and truly antiaromatic systems containing s&#8208;block metals are altogether absent or remain poorly defined. Using spectroscopic, structural, and computational techniques, we present herein the synthesis and authentication of a heterocyclic compound containing the alkaline earth metal beryllium that exhibits significant antiaromaticity, and detail its chemical reduction and Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;coordination chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Active Cooperative Lewis Acid &#8211; Ammonium Salt Catalyst for the Enantioselective Hydroboration of Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high&#8208;value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type which allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15400), which were increased by around 1.5&#8208;3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported. In our concept an aprotic ammonium halide moiety cooperates with an oxophilic Lewis acid within the same catalyst molecule. Control experiments reveal that both catalytic centers are essential for the observed activity. Kinetic, spectroscopic and computational studies show that the hydride transfer is rate limiting and proceeds via a concerted mechanism, in which hydride at B is continuously &#160;displaced by iodide, reminiscent to an S  N  2 reaction. The catalyst, which is accessible in high yields in few steps, was found to be stable during catalysis, readily recyclable and could be reused 10 times still efficiently working.</dc:description>

      <title>Phenotypic Discovery of Neuroprotective Agents by Regulation of Tau Proteostasis via Stress&#8208;Responsive Activation of PERK Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>Tau protein aggregates are a recognized neuropathological feature in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease as well as many other neurodegenerative disorders, known as tauopathies. The development of tau&#8208;targeting therapies is therefore extremely important but efficient strategies or protein targets are still unclear. Here, we performed a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and identified a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal tau protein aggregation. By applying label&#8208;free target identification technology, we revealed that the transient enhancement of protein kinase&#8208;like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling pathway through the inhibition of stress&#8208;responsive SB1617 targets, PDIA3 and DNAJC3, is an effective strategy for regulating proteostasis in tauopathies. The molecular mechanism and the promising efficacy of SB1617 were demonstrated in neuronal cells and a mouse model with traumatic brain injury, a tauopathy known to involve ER stress.</dc:description>

In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de novo selection of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; can achieve the efficient transition from a binding inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results proved that the &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion.

Fe  2  N@C nanoparticles were reported to exhibit outstanding performance toward selective CO  2  hydrogenation to C  2+  hydrocarbons (C  2+  selectivity: 53.96%; C  2  &#8208;C  4  =  selectivity, 31.03%), outperforming corresponding Fe@C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, ex situ  M&#246;ssbauer  and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra revealed that iron nitrides were in situ converted to highly active iron carbides, which acted as the real active species. Moreover, the combined results of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and control experiments suggested an in situ formed carbonyl iron&#8208;mediated conversion mechanism from iron nitrides to iron carbides.</dc:description>

      <title>London Dispersion Rather than Steric Hindrance Determines the Enantioselectivity of the Corey&#8208;Bakshi&#8208;Shibata Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>The well&#8208;known Corey&#8208;Bakshi&#8208;Shibata (CBS) reduction is a powerful method for the asymmetric synthesis of alcohols from prochiral ketones, often featuring high yields and excellent selectivi&#173;ties.&#160;&#160;While steric repulsion has been regarded as the key director of the&#160;observed&#160;high enantioselectivity for many years,&#160;here&#160;we show that&#160;London dispersion (LD) interactions are at least as important for enantiodiscrimination.&#160;&#160;We exemplify this through a combination of&#160;detailed computational and experimental studies for a series of modi&#173;fied CBS catalysts equipped with dispersion energy donors (DEDs) in the catalysts and the substrates.&#160;&#160;Our results demonstrate that attrac&#173;tive LD interactions between the catalyst and the substrate rather than steric repulsion determine the selectivity.&#160;&#160;As a key outcome of our study, we were able to improve the catalyst design for some challeng&#173;ing CBS reductions.</dc:description>

      <title>&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Encapsulation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives: A Storable Feedstock for Preparation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
      <dc:description>The bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) scaffold is useful in medicinal chemistry, and many protocols are available for synthesizing BCP derivatives from [1.1.1]propellane. However, little progress has been made in the preparation of [1.1.1]propellane since the first practical synthesis in 1985. Here, we report the &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of BCP derivatives, affording a stable, readily storable material from which BCPs can be easily and quantitatively recovered. We have also developed new and simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP to afford [1.1.1]propellane in protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar solvents. The combination of these methodologies enables simple, on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in various solvents under mild conditions from &#945;&#8208;CD capsules containing 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane&#8208;associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct&#8208;acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane&#8208;bound NS5A structure. Here we present the structural model of an NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated&#160;via&#160;synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self&#8208;interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the&#160;first characterization&#160;of NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>C&#8211;H Activation by an Iron&#8208;Nitrido Bis&#8208;Pocket Porphyrin Species</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;nitrido species are nitrogen analogues of iron&#8208;oxo species which are versatile reagents for C&#8211;H oxidation. Nonetheless, C&#8211;H activation by iron&#8208;nitrido species has been scarcely explored, as this is often hampered by their instability and short lifetime in solutions. Herein, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of an Fe porphyrin nitrido species (  2c  ) toward C&#8211;H substrates was studied in solutions at room temperature, which was achieved by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of its Fe(III)&#8208;azido precursor (  1c  ) supported by a bulky bis&#8208;pocket porphyrin ligand. C&#8211;H bonds with bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of up to ~84 kcal mol  &#8208;1  could be activated, and the second&#8208;order rate constants (  k  2  ) are on the order of 10  2  &#8211;10  4  s  &#8208;1  M  &#8208;1  .

      <title>Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper&#160;Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the extensive development in trifluoromethylation, introduction of a trifluoromethyl group into an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond is significantly challenging. Herein, we report the development of a mild and operationally simple C(sp3)&#8211;H trifluoromethylation method for unactivated alkanes utilizing a bench&#8208;stable Cu(III) complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as a visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;induced reaction initiator, a trifluoromethyl radical source as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and a trifluoromethyl anion source for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by reactive electrophilic carbon&#8208;centered CF3 radical generation from photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, which performs hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C&#8211;CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical&#8208;polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The newly developed reaction can be applied to various methylene selective trifluoromethylation reactions including direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Improved Asparaginyl Ligase&#8208;catalyzed Transpeptidation via Selective Nucleophile Quenching</title>
      <dc:description>The use of enzymes for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins/peptides has become a highly accessible, widespread approach to study protein/peptide functions or to generate therapeutic conjugates. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) that preferentially catalyze transpeptidation reactions (AEP ligases) have emerged as enticing alternatives to established approaches, such as bacterial sortases, due to their catalytic efficiency and short tripeptide recognition motifs. However, under standard conditions, a substantial excess of the nucleophile to be conjugated is needed to reach desirable yields. Herein we report a versatile approach to shift the AEP&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation equilibrium toward product formation via selectively quenching the nucleophilicity of the competing leaving group peptide. Our metal complexation&#8208;based strategy enables efficient peptide/protein labeling at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus with near&#8208;equimolar concentrations of nucleophile label. Furthermore, we show that this approach can enhance protein&#8208;protein ligation and facilitate the formation of transpeptidation products that are otherwise unattainable.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Selective N&#8208;Formylation of Amines with CO2 and H2 Catalyzed by Porous Organometallic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to fine chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for CO2  capture and utilization. Herein we demonstrated a series of porous organometallic polymers could be employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for this purpose. Synergetic effects of specific surface area, iridium content, and CO2  adsorption capability are crucial to achieve excellent selectivity and yields towards N&#8208;formylation of diverse amines with CO2  and H2  under mild reaction conditions even at 20 ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory calculations revealed not only a redox&#8208;neutral catalytic pathway but also a new plausible mechanism with the incorporation of the key intermediate formic acid via a proton&#8208;relay process. Remarkably, a record turnover number (TON = 1.58 &#215; 106  ) was achieved in the synthesis of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solid catalysts can be reused up to 12 runs, highlighting their practical potential in industry.</dc:description>

      <title>The Challenge of Peptide Proteolytic Stability Studies: Scarce Data, Difficult Readability, and the Need for Harmonization</title>
      <dc:description>
The assessment of peptide stability is a fundamental component of peptide characterization. Researchers can find numerous methods in the literature to assess stability. However, in general, the results are not comparable, since a given technique possesses certain specificities. Another major fault is the stability report. The lack of harmonization hampers a proper comparison of data, which makes their interpretation more demanding.







Abstract
Proteolytic stability assessment is increasingly viewed as a fundamental component of peptide characterization, arguably of comparable importance as efficacy and toxicity data. A literature survey over the last decade reveals steady growth in the stability information available. However, it also uncovers two significant problems that hinder proper data comparison: 1)&#8197;the use of different stability assays, and 2)&#8197;the differences in how stability information is reported. In this Viewpoint, we present results from a database meta&#8208;analysis as well as concerns about the stability assessments published so far. We also suggest guidelines for a proper discussion between experts in the field on how to improve data readability so that peptide stability, an often&#8208;missing parameter in older literature, is adequately reported to take maximum advantage of it.

     alt="The Challenge of Peptide Proteolytic Stability Studies: Scarce Data, Difficult Readability, and the Need for Harmonization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment of peptide stability is a fundamental component of peptide characterization. Researchers can find numerous methods in the literature to assess stability. However, in general, the results are not comparable, since a given technique possesses certain specificities. Another major fault is the stability report. The lack of harmonization hampers a proper comparison of data, which makes their interpretation more demanding.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteolytic stability assessment is increasingly viewed as a fundamental component of peptide characterization, arguably of comparable importance as efficacy and toxicity data. A literature survey over the last decade reveals steady growth in the stability information available. However, it also uncovers two significant problems that hinder proper data comparison: 1)&#8197;the use of different stability assays, and 2)&#8197;the differences in how stability information is reported. In this Viewpoint, we present results from a database meta&#8208;analysis as well as concerns about the stability assessments published so far. We also suggest guidelines for a proper discussion between experts in the field on how to improve data readability so that peptide stability, an often&#8208;missing parameter in older literature, is adequately reported to take maximum advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Observation of the Reaction Intermediates of Methanol Dehydrogenation by Cationic Vanadium Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Detection and characterization of fleeting reaction intermediates and active sites are crucial for molecular&#8208;level knowledge of catalysis; insight that is required to understand the catalytic mechanisms, and to design novel high performance catalysts. We report a mass spectrometric study of the reactions of 3d early transition metal (vanadium, [Ar]3d  3  4s  2  ) cationic clusters with methanol in a low&#8208;pressure collision cell. For comparison, the reaction of methanol with 3d late transition metal (cobalt, [Ar]3d  7  4s  2  ) cationic clusters were studied as well. In the vanadium case, the main reaction products are fully dehydrogenated species, and partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species are observed as minors, for which the relative intensities increase with cluster size and also at low cluster source temperature cooled by liquid nitrogen; while no dehydrogenation products have been observed for cobalt clusters. That demonstrates the strikingly different reactivity of vanadium and cobalt cationic clusters towards methanol. Quantum chemical calculations explored the reaction pathways and revealed that the fully dehydrogenation products of the reaction between V  n  +  and methanol are V  n  (C)(O)  +  , in which C and O are separated due to the high oxophilicity of vanadium. The partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species observed in the experiment are verified to be reaction intermediates along the reaction pathway, and their most probable structures have been proposed.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There has been a controversy surrounding the roles of the metal core (metal&#8208;metal interaction) and the shell (metal&#8208;ligand interaction) in photoluminescence of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. Our group has discovered aggregation&#8208;induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of platinum&#8208;thiolate complex and its silver ion inclusion complex (i.e. silver doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster). The inclusion of silver ion has boosted photoluminescent quantum yield by 18 times. The results of photophysical measurements indicated that the rate of nonradiative decay was slower for silver doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster. Density functional theory calculations showed that the LUMO, which had the main contribution from Ag  s  &#8208;orbital and Pt  d  &#8208;orbitals, played a critical role in suppressing the structural distortion at the excited state.

      <title>Effective enantioselective recognition by chiral amino&#8208;phosphonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>The research on chiral recognition and selection is not only fundamental in deciding the mystery of homochirality, but also informative in terms of substrate recognition in biological processes and asymmetric catalysis. We report an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts having chiral (R and S) amino substituents that are utilized&#160;towards the enantioselective recognition of a variety of chiral compounds having functional groups such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol. These simple phosphonium salts are found to exhibit an extremely high enantiomeric discrimination for 1&#8208;cyclohexylethylamine (CY). A remarkable guest selectivity (&#958;) value of 5.3 X 10  8  for the enantiomer of  S  &#8208;CY over  R  &#8208;CY is achieved by using the R&#8208;isomer of the aminophosphonium salt .

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Red Phosphors and Their Core&#8208;Shell Structure for Improved Water&#8208;Resistance for Laser Diodes Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Single crystal luminescence materials usually show higher luminous efficiency and better stability than a powdery one. Poor water resistance of Mn  4+  doped powdery fluoride red phosphors limits their further application for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) with high color rendering index. In this report, we have presented a solvent&#8208;vapor transport route for centimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal red phosphor development. As a side benefit, the epitaxial growth route to yield its core&#8208;shell structure at ambient temperature was adopted. These single&#8208;crystal red phosphors could be applied in all&#8208;inorganic WLED devices without any organic resin. Cs  2  TiF  6  :Mn  4+  (CTFM) single crystal provides a significant enhancement of quantum efficiency, moisture resistance, and thermal stability as compared to its polycrystalline powders. Particularly, the internal quantum efficiency can reach as high as 98.7%. To further improve waterproof stability, the Cs  2  TiF  6  (CTF) shell with tunable thickness has been epitaxially grown on the CTFM single crystal surface and a unique three&#8208;step photoluminescence intensity evolution mechanism has been proposed. By combining as&#8208;prepared CTFM@CTF core&#8208;shell structured single crystal, YAG:Ce single crystal and blue&#8208;chip, warm WLEDs with excellent color rendition (R  a  = 90, R  9  = 94), low correlated color temperature (CCT = 3155 K), and high luminous efficacy have been fabricated without any organic resins.

      <title>Kinetic Barriers and Microscopic Mechanisms of Noble Gas Adsorption by Nanoporous &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2 Obtained by means of Sub&#8208;Second X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>Gas adsorption by porous frameworks sometimes result in structure &#8220;breathing&#8221;, &#8220;pores opening/closing&#8221;, &#8220;negative gas adsorption&#8221;, and other fascinating phenomena   which can be revealed and explained with the use of  in situ  diffraction methods.

Using such advanced sub&#8208;second  in situ  powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, three various intracrystalline diffusion scenarios have been evaluated from the isothermal kinetics of Ar, Kr, and Xe adsorption by nanoporous &#947;&#8209;Mg(BH4)2. These scenarios are dictated by  two possible simultaneous transport mechanisms: diffusion through the intra&#8208; (i) and interchannel apertures (ii) of  &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2  crystal structure. The contribution of i and ii changes depending on the kinetic diameter of the noble gas molecule and temperature regime.  The lowest single activation barrier for the smallest Ar suggests equal diffusion of the atoms trough both pathways. Contrary, for the medium sized Kr we resolve the contributions of two parallel transport mechanisms, which tentatively can be attributed to the smaller  barrier of the migration paths  via  the channel like pores and the higher barrier for the diffusion  via  &#160; narrow aperture between these channels. Remarkably, the largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier.

      <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of the unprecedented compounds IDipp  &#183;E&#8217;H 2  AsH 2  (E&#8217; = Al, Ga; IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported, the first monomeric, only by a LB (LB = Lewis Base) stabilized parent representatives of an arsanylalane and arsanylgallane, respectively. They are prepared via a salt metathesis reaction of KAsH 2  with IDipp  &#183;E&#8217;H 2  Cl (E&#8217; = Al, Ga). The H 2  &#8208;elimination pathway by the reaction of AsH 3  with IDipp  &#183;E&#8217;H 3  (E&#8217; = Al, Ga) was found to be a possible synthetic route with some disadvantages compared to the salt metathesis reaction.

      <title>Gel&#8208;Derived Amorphous BiNi Alloy Promotes Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation via Optimizing Nitrogen Adsorption and Activation</title>
      <dc:description>To achieve electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for efficient and sustainable NH3 production, catalysts should exhibit high selectivity and activity with optimal adsorption energy. Here we developed a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) amorphous BiNi alloy toward a significantly enhanced NRR compared with its crystalline and metal counterparts.

The enhanced electron transfer and increased electrochemical surface area were revealed in the interconnected porous scaffold, allowing its sufficiently efficient and stable activity for potential practical applications.

      <title>Dynamic Activation of Adsorped Intermediates via Axial Traction for the Promoted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (e.g., M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100% at &#8208;0.9 V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90% in a wide range of potential window from &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;1.1 V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen ligand that induces an axial traction effect. The unique structure was evidenced by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the introduction of axial oxygen atom could optimize surface states of Ni&#8208;N4 moieties and enhance the charge polarization effect, therefore decreasing the potential barrier of intermediate COOH* formation, a key factor to accelerate the reaction kinetics and boost the CO2RR performance.</dc:description>

Therefore, new and efficient methods for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides is highly in demand.

      <title>Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2: Towards Stable Cycling at 4.6 V</title>
      <dc:description>LiCoO2, the first choice cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in 3C products due to its high volumetric energy density, typically only delivers a capacity of ~175&#8201;mAh/g although its theoretical specific capacity is as high as 274&#8201;mAh/g. The challenge is that cationic/anodic&#8208;redox&#8208;induced unstable phase transition, oxygen escape, and side reactions with electrolytes always occur when charging LiCoO2  to voltages higher than 4.35&#8201;V for delivering a higher capacity, which result in severe capacity fade. Herein, we demonstrate a Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  that can be cycled steadily at 4.6 V. Dopant Mg ions, serving as &#8220;pillar&#8221;in the Li&#8208;slab of LiCoO2, prevent slab sliding at highly delithiated state, thereby suppressing unfavorable phase transitions. Moreover, the resulted Li&#8208;Mg mixing phase at the surface of Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  is beneficial for eliminating the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase overgrown and phase transformation in the close&#8208;to&#8208;surface region. Consequently, Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  exhibits a high capacity of 204 mAh/g at 0.2 C and a remarkably enhanced capacity retention of 84% at 1.0 C over 100 cycles within the voltage window of 3.0&#8208;4.6 V. In sharp contrast, pristine LiCoO2&#160; gives a much lower capacity retention of 14% within the same voltage window.</dc:description>

The challenge is that cationic/anodic&#8208;redox&#8208;induced unstable phase transition, oxygen escape, and side reactions with electrolytes always occur when charging LiCoO2  to voltages higher than 4.35&#8201;V for delivering a higher capacity, which result in severe capacity fade. Herein, we demonstrate a Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  that can be cycled steadily at 4.6 V. Dopant Mg ions, serving as &#8220;pillar&#8221;in the Li&#8208;slab of LiCoO2, prevent slab sliding at highly delithiated state, thereby suppressing unfavorable phase transitions. Moreover, the resulted Li&#8208;Mg mixing phase at the surface of Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  is beneficial for eliminating the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase overgrown and phase transformation in the close&#8208;to&#8208;surface region. Consequently, Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  exhibits a high capacity of 204 mAh/g at 0.2 C and a remarkably enhanced capacity retention of 84% at 1.0 C over 100 cycles within the voltage window of 3.0&#8208;4.6 V. In sharp contrast, pristine LiCoO2&#160; gives a much lower capacity retention of 14% within the same voltage window.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Liquid nanoparticles: manipulating the nucleation and growth of nanoscale droplets</title>
      <dc:description>By manipulating the nucleation and growth of solid materials, the synthesis of various sophisticated nanostructures has been achieved. Similar methodology, if applied to liquid, could enable the mass&#8208;production and control of ultra&#8208;small droplets at the scale of nanoparticles (10  &#8208;18  &#160;L or below). It would be highly desirable since droplets plays a fundamental role in numerous applications. Here we present a general strategy to synthesize and manipulate nanoscale droplets, similar to what has been done to solid nanoparticles in the classis solution&#8208;synthesis. It was achieved by a solute&#8208;induced phase separation which initiates the nucleation of droplets from a homogeneous solution. These liquid nanoparticles have great potentials to be manipulated like their solid counterparts, borrowing from the vast methodologies of nanoparticle synthesis, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth and co&#8208;precipitations. LNPs also serve as a general synthetic platform, to fabricate nanoreactors, drug&#8208;loaded carriers, and other hollow nanostructures with a variety of shell materials.</dc:description>

Title: A Supramolecular Bait to Trigger Non&#8208;equilibrium Co&#8208;assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
      <dc:description>In the living systems, the non&#8208;equilibrium states that control the assembly&#8208;disassembly of cellular components underlie the gradual complexification of life, whereas in the nonliving systems, most molecules follow the laws of thermodynamic equilibrium to sustain dynamic consistency. However, very little is known about the roles of non&#8208;equilibrium states of interactions between supramolecules in living systems. Here, we identified a non&#8208;equilibrium state of interaction between supramolecular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and A&#946;42, an aggregate&#8208;prone protein that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structurally, the polymerized propagation of A&#946;42 presents a specific groove that is recognized by the amphiphilicity of LPS bait in a non&#8208;equilibrium manner. Functionally, the transient complex elicits a cellular response to clear extracellular A&#946;42 deposits via an endolysosomal mechanism in neuronal cells. Since the impaired clearance of toxic A&#946;42 deposits correlates with AD pathology, the non&#8208;equilibrium interaction between LPS and A&#946;42 could represent a useful target for the development of AD therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Selection and Characterization of an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme Specifically Activated by Legionella pneumophila</title>
      <dc:description>Legionella pneumophila  is a deadly bacterial pathogen that has caused numerous Legionnaires&#8217; disease outbreaks, where cooling towers were the most common source of exposure. Bacterial culturing is used for  L. pneumophila  detection, but this method takes approximately 10 days to complete. In this work, we isolated an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme, named LP1. Extensive characterization revealed that LP1 is reactive with multiple infectious isolates of  L. pneumophila  but inactive with 25 other common bacterial species. It is likely activated by a protein target, is capable of generating a detectable signal in the presence of as few as 10 colony forming units of  L. pneumophila  , and is able to maintain its activity in cooling tower water from diverse sources. Given that similar DNAzymes have been incorporated into many sensitive assays for bacterial detection, LP1 holds the potential for the development of biosensors for monitoring the contamination of  L. pneumophila  in exposure sources.</dc:description>

      <title>Induction of chirality in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) built from achiral precursors</title>
      <dc:description>Induction of chirality from achiral assembly system remains a huge challenge related to the origin of life and rational design of chiral materials. Here, both origin and control of chirality in a MOF built from achiral precursors have been realized. Assembling achiral H  3  BTB ligands and Zn(II)/Cd(II) clusters leads to a 2D coordination polymer (  FJI&#8208;H16  ), while introduction of achiral pyridine into such assembly system leads to a 3D chiral MOF (  FJI&#8208;H27  (  M  ) or (  P  )). The driven force for chiral origin of  FJI&#8208;H27  has been proved to be a pyridine participated kinetic&#8208;control assembly process, which can be controlled by changing the amount of pyridine and temperature, from no induction to partial induction to complete induction. The chiral generation and amplification process has been identified in detail through a pyridine&#8208;involved key intermediate (  FJI&#8208;H28  ). The targeted modification of pyridine can selectively lead to  FJI&#8208;H27  (  M  ) or  FJI&#8208;H27  (  P  ), making the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk  FJI&#8208;H27  samples can be controlled.

      <title>Efficient conjugation approach for coupling drugs to native antibodies via the Pt(II)&#8209;linker Lx&#174; for improved manufacturability of antibody&#8209;drug conjugates (ADCs)</title>
      <dc:description>The Pt(II)&#8209;linker [ethylenediamineplatinum(II)]  2+  , coined  &#8220;Lx&#8221;  &#174;  , has emerged as a novel non&#8208;conventional approach to antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) and has shown its potential in preclinical  in vitro  and  in vivo  benchmark studies. A crucial improvement of the  Lx  &#8209;conjugation reaction from initially &lt;15% to ~75&#8209;90% conjugation efficiency is described, resulting from a systematic screening of all relevant reaction parameters. The main unexpected and counterintuitive finding was that NaI, a strikingly simple inorganic salt additive, greatly improves&#160;the conjugation efficiency as well as the conjugation selectivity simply by exchanging the leaving chloride ligand on Cl&#8209;  Lx  &#8209;drug complexes &#8211; which are direct precursors for  Lx  &#8209;ADCs &#8211; for iodide, thus generating I&#8209;  Lx  &#8209;drug complexes as more reactive species. Using this &#8220;iodide effect&#8221;, we developed a general and highly practical conjugation procedure which was shown to be perfectly scalable: our lead  Lx  &#8209;ADC was produced on a 5 g scale with an outstanding conjugation efficiency of 89%. This unique metal&#8208;based conjugation approach will no doubt show its true value in future clinical trials.</dc:description>

      <title>Connecting hydrophobic surfaces in cyclic peptides increases membrane permeability</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;methylation or C&#8208;methylation in natural and synthetic cyclic peptides can increase membrane permeability, but it remains unclear why this happens in some cases but not others. Here we compare three&#8208;dimensional structures for cyclic peptides from six families, including isomers differing only in the location of a single N&#8208; or Ca&#8208;methyl substituent. We show that a single methyl group only increases membrane permeability when it connects or expands hydrophobic surface patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area and total hydrophobic surface area, can still have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch. The results illuminate a key local molecular determinant of membrane permeability.</dc:description>

      <title>Controllable Distribution of Oxygen Vacancies in Grain Boundaries of p&#8208;Si/TiO2 Heterojunction Photocathodes for Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Silicon is a promising photocathode in photoelectrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production, but it is primarily limited by photocorrosion in aqueous electrolytes. As an extensively used protective material, crystalline TiO2 could protect Si photoelectrode against corrosion. However, a large number of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline TiO2 would induce excessive recombination centers, impeding the carrier transport. This paper describes the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ovac) with controllable spatial distribution for GBs to promote carrier transport. Two kinds of Ovac distribution, Ovac along GBs and Ovac inside grains,&#160; are compared, where the latter one is demonstrated to facilitate carrier transport owing to the formation of tunneling paths across GBs. Consequently, a simple p&#8208;Si/TiO2/Pt heterojunction photocathode with controllable Ovac distribution in TiO2 shows a +400 mV onset potential shift and yields an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 5.9%, which is the best efficiency reported among silicon photocathodes except for silicon homojunction.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Non&#8208;helical One&#8208;dimensional Channels and Microtubes Assembled from Enantiomers of Difluorenol</title>
      <dc:description>The design and assembly of photoelectro&#8208;active molecular channel structures is of great importance because of their special advantages in charge mobility, photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, proton conduction and exciton transport. Besides macrocycle stacking and knot + linker connection, this work rarely provides a fresh strategy for the exquisite design of 1D channel based on a pair of mirror isomers. Racemic 9,9'&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bifluorene]&#8208;9,9'&#8208;diol (DPFOH) enantiomers were proved to be utilized as newfashioned building modules for the non&#8208;helical 1D channel structures. Although the individual molecule doesn&#8217;t present any molecular symmetry, two pairs of racemic DPFOH enantiomers can form a C2&#8208;symmetric closed loop via the stereoscopic herringbone assembly. Thanks to the special symmetry derived from the enantiomer pairs, the multiple supramolecular interactions and the padding from solvent molecules, this conventionally unstable topological structure is achieved. The self&#8208;similar relationship of tubular structures spanning from molecular level to microscale level was explained. Finally, the lithium&#8208;ion transport performance was demonstrated, showing a significant ion conductivity of 1.77&#215;10&#8208;4 S/cm, indicating the potential research value of this novel 1D channel structure.</dc:description>
