         <title>Regio&#8208;controllable Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation/ Hydroboration of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent addition reactions provide straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approaches to access different regioisomers. However, the regio&#8208;chemistry control to access all the possible results is still challenging especially for the reaction involving multiple addition steps. Herein, we reported regio&#8208;controllable cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylacetylenes, delivering all the possible regio&#8208;outcomes with high regioselectivities (up to &gt;20/1  rr  for all the cases). Each regioisomer of value&#8208;added silylboronates could be efficiently and regioselectively obtained from the same materials. The adjustment of the ligands of cobalt catalysts combined with dual catalysis relay strategy is the key to achieve regio&#8208;chemistry control. This regio&#8208;controllable research might inspire the exploration of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis that involve multiple additions and provide full sets of regioisomers of other synthetic useful molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Quick and Easy Method for Dramatic Improvement of the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO  2  reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO  2  reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7,300,000 s  &#8211;1  , which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated Fe(I) species and CO  2  in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Organic Co&#8208;crystals Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and  intriguing  properties, such as room temperature ferroelectricity and two&#8208;photon absorption ability. However, the supramolecular interactions of co&#8208;crystals restrict their stability in the aqueous solution phase, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we reported on the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application of self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca  2+  as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8208;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47 &#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be enhanced and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy. This conceptual work demonstrates the feasibility of using organic co&#8208;crystals in aqueous solution and should pave the way to a wide variety of photonic and biophotonic applications via such new platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Squalene&#8208;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis so far, however, has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (  S  )&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids such as (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone, an SHC wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC from&#160;  Acidothermus cellulolyticus  &#160;(  Aci  SHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of the desired monocyclic (  R  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (  E/Z  )&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased by two orders of magnitude&#160;to 79%.&#160;Notably, analyzed&#160;  Aci  SHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the  Z  &#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (  R  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99%&#160;  ee  ), the&#160;  E  &#8208;isomer was converted to the (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95%&#160;  ee  ). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (  S  )&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9%&#160;  ee  ) could be obtained through substrate engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as antibacterial and antibiofilm agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks (DCFs) were synthesized and screened for biofilm inhibition or disruption. They are composed of a trialdehyde core reversibly linked to a diamine PEG connector and to a variety of neutral, anionic or cationic heads, to generate a library of DCFs to generate multivalent dendritic architectures in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The best DCFs were always polycationic and the nature of the cationic heads significantly impact the antibiofilm activity. The best antibiofilm activity was observed for DCF3B, displaying a polyethyleneimine head. Interestingly, a simple inactive guanidinium functional head, strongly inhibited biofilm growth when assayed as a multivalent DCF3C. Using a more advanced in vitro bio&#64257;lm model of chronic wound infection, DCF3C was found significantly superior than all other DCFs.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is an important process in light olefin industry; however,  the  over&#8208;oxidation  of ethane  leads to low ethylene selectivity. Here, we report a novel approach to electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in anode in conjunction with CO  2  reduction at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser using a porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO  2  electrode at 600&#176;C. We identify and engineer the flux and chemical states of active oxygen species that evolve from the lattice at anode surface in order to activate and dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene  via  the reaction of epoxy species. Active oxygen species (O  2  &#8722;  , O  2  2  &#8722;  and O  2  &#8722;  ) at the anode surface effectively dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, but O  &#8722;  species tend to induce deep oxidation. We demonstrate exceptionally high ethylene selectivity of 95% and an ethane conversion of 10% with a durable operation of 300 h.</dc:description>

         <title>A Congruent&#8208;Melting Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are vital for the development of photonics research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art laser technology, but the study of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient dij and laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), as well as the harsh synthetic conditions that are usually needed. Herein, we report the facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs4V8O22 (CVO) featuring a quasi&#8208;rigid honeycomb&#8208;layered structure with [VO4] and [VO5] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR&#8208;transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent&#8208;melting behavior.&#160;In particular, it displays very strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG intensities in the metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064 nm and 2.2 &#215; AgGaS2 @ 2100 nm). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within the [V4O11]&#8734; layer, and that the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure. These attributes suggest that CVO is an outstanding mid&#8208;IR NLO candidate material.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitride Supported&#160;High&#8208;Loading Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Activating of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2&#160;with 100% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of  1O2. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atoms catalyst (Fe1/CN) containing highly uniform Fe&#8208;N4  active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2 wt%. The Fe1/CN achieves generation of 100%  1O2  by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single&#8208;atom sites, the Fe&#8208;N4  sites in Fe1/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO5&#8226;&#8208;, and thereafter efficiently generate  1O2  with 100% selectivity. In addition, the Fe1/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS. This work develops a novel catalyst for the 100% selective production of  1O2  for highly selective and efficient degradation of pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to methanol via atomically dispersed Sn coupled with defective CuO catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using renewable electricity to drive CO  2  electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO  2  reduction. Currently, CO  2  electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6% with a current density of 67.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO  2  adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO  2  activation  via  decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum&#160;in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom Pt  1  /CeO  2  catalyst by atom trapping (AT, 800  o  C in air) shows excellent thermal stability, however, it is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures due to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt  2+  in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt  1  O  4  coordination. Reductive activation forming Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity, however, NPs are easily oxidized leading to drastic activity loss. Here we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt  2+  via thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt  1  /CeO  2  catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt; 1200  o  C) in an inert atmosphere induce surface reconstruction of CeO  2  , generating Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt  1  O  4  configuration. Originating from this unique coordination, Pt  1  &#948;+  in a partially reduced state dynamically evolved during CO oxidation, resulting in an exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. The CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt  1  /CeO  2  _TS catalyst is retained under oxidizing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A New and Efficient Diazirine Based Four&#8208;armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photo&#8208;patterning method is critical for all&#8208;solution fabrication of integrated electronic devices based on organic/polymeric semiconductors. In this paper, we report a new diazirine based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (  4CNN  ) with a tetrahedron geometry for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion reaction. After blending of  4  CNN  with no more than 3% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of  p  &#8208;,  n  &#8208; and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was successfully achieved, and regular patterns with size as small as 5 &#181;m were prepared easily with the aid of appropriate photomasks after UV (365 nm) light irradiation for just 40 s. Remarkably, the interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of photo-patterning method is critical for all-solution fabrication of integrated electronic devices based on organic/polymeric semiconductors. In this paper, we report a new diazirine based four-armed cross-linker (  4CNN  ) with a tetrahedron geometry for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo-induced carbene insertion reaction. After blending of  4  CNN  with no more than 3% (w/w), photo-patterning of  p  -,  n  - and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was successfully achieved, and regular patterns with size as small as 5 &#181;m were prepared easily with the aid of appropriate photomasks after UV (365 nm) light irradiation for just 40 s. Remarkably, the interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross-linking. As a consequence, the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. By taking the advantage of the fact that the cross-linked thin films are robust and show good resistance to organic solvents, a complementary-like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo-patterning of the  p  -type and  n  -type semiconducting polymers. These results demonstrate that  4CNN  is a new generation of cross-linker for the photo-patterning of polymeric semiconductors, and hold great potentials for all-solution processible flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine  N  &#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and  N&#8208;  triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed  sp  2  &#8208;  sp  3  cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct detection of surface species formed on iridium electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. In this study, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8208;3&#160;nm of (024), (026), (113) and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8208;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick sub&#8208;surface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8208;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8208;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a new kind of butterfly&#8208;like molecules of oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine (OAP) are reported, which exhibit typical characteristics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. Unlike any of the reported RIV&#8208;type AIE molecules, the synthetic procedures of which are complicated and associated high costs,  OAP  AIEgens can be synthesized in a facile manner by a one&#8208;step catalyst&#8208;free reaction using commercially available materials. Notably,  OAP  AIEgens are ideal ligands for constructing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their built&#8208;in coordination sites of pyrazine groups.  OAP&#8208;based MOFs exhibit multiple potential applications in reversible gas response, encrypted information storage, and construction of white light&#8208;emitting devices. This work enriches limited kinds of RIV&#8208;type AIEgens, offers additional selections of bridging ligands for constructing luminescent MOFs and provides a visualized prototype to understand the effect of RIV process on the luminescence property of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocycles via Oxidant&#8208;Free Dehydrocyclization of Alcohols Using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent developments in which both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. The strategies for the preparation and functionalization of heterogeneous catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and the roles of heterogeneous catalysts in these reactions are also discussed.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocycles, such as pyrroles, pyrimidines, quinazolines, and quinoxalines, are important building blocks for organic chemistry and the fine&#8208;chemical industry. For their synthesis, catalytic borrowing hydrogen and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols as sustainable reagents have received significant attention in recent years. To overcome the problems of product separation and catalyst reusability, several metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to achieve these transformations with good yields and selectivity. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments using both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. Furthermore, this Minireview introduces strategies for the preparation and functionalization of the corresponding heterogeneous catalysts, discusses the reaction mechanisms and the roles of metal electronic states, and the influence of support Lewis acid&#8211;base properties on these reactions.

         <title>Cyclic Amplification of the Afterglow Luminescent Nanoreporter Enables the Prediction of Anti&#8208;cancer Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic afterglow luminescent nanoreporter (PFODBT@CPPO) is developed for visualizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and predicting immunogenic cell death during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. The thiophene&#8208;based afterglow luminescent nanoplatform is important to develop novel afterglow luminescent materials and provide instant information to avoid adverse immune responses.







Abstract
We developed a cyclic amplification method for an organic afterglow nanoreporter for the real&#8208;time visualization of self&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). We promoted semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFODBT) as a candidate for emitting near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescence. Introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate (CPPO) into PFODBT (PFODBT@CPPO) resulted in a significant enhancement of afterglow intensity through the dual cyclic amplification pathway involving singlet oxygen (1O2). 1O2 produced by PFODBT@CPPO induced cancer cell necrosis and promoted the release of damage&#8208;related molecular patterns, thereby evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;associated immune responses through ROS&#8208;based oxidative stress. The afterglow luminescent signals of the nanoreporter were well correlated with light&#8208;driven 1O2 generation and anti&#8208;cancer efficiency. This imaging strategy provides a non&#8208;invasive tool for predicting the therapeutic outcome that occurs during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;An organic afterglow luminescent nanoreporter (PFODBT@CPPO) is developed for visualizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and predicting immunogenic cell death during ROS-mediated cancer therapy. The thiophene-based afterglow luminescent nanoplatform is important to develop novel afterglow luminescent materials and provide instant information to avoid adverse immune responses.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a cyclic amplification method for an organic afterglow nanoreporter for the real-time visualization of self-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). We promoted semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFODBT) as a candidate for emitting near-infrared afterglow luminescence. Introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate (CPPO) into PFODBT (PFODBT@CPPO) resulted in a significant enhancement of afterglow intensity through the dual cyclic amplification pathway involving singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by PFODBT@CPPO induced cancer cell necrosis and promoted the release of damage-related molecular patterns, thereby evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD)-associated immune responses through ROS-based oxidative stress. The afterglow luminescent signals of the nanoreporter were well correlated with light-driven &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation and anti-cancer efficiency. This imaging strategy provides a non-invasive tool for predicting the therapeutic outcome that occurs during ROS-mediated cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrafast Water Transport in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels Enabled by Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Controllable Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and high&#8208;efficiency water transport behaviour in 2D GO confined spacing assisted by spherical polyelectrolyte brushes can be easily realized. Further studies revealed that the water transport capacity was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent.







Abstract
Fast water transport channels are crucial for water&#8208;related membrane separation processes. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between flux and selectivity is still a major challenge. To address this, we constructed spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) structures with a highly hydrophilic polyelectrolyte brush layer, and introduced them into GO laminates, which increased both the flux and the separation factor. At 70&#8201;&#176;C, the flux reached 5.23&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the separation factor of butanol/water increased to &#8776;8000, which places it among the most selective separation membranes reported to date. Interestingly, further studies demonstrated that the enhancement of water transport was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains, but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structure&#8208;performance correlations between water molecule migration and the flexibility of the ordered polymer chains in the 2D confined space.

         <title>Exploring the Druggability of Conserved RNA Regulatory Elements in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains 15 independently folded regulatory RNA elements. By NMR&#8208;based fragment screening, the RNA target space for small molecule binding, functional mapping and inhibition is defined.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30&#8201;000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from in vivo and ex&#8208;vivo structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbor ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D and 3D N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are prepared and used as heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (RROP) of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The 2D COFs had higher catalytic activity and showed dimensionality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%).







Abstract
Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Herein we illustrate photocatalytic performances of N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded 2D&#8208;PN COFs and one 3D&#8208;PN COF were prepared. All can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers with a combination of linear (l) and cyclic (c) repeat units. The 2D&#8208;PN COFs have much higher catalytic activity than the 3D&#8208;PN COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%). The improved performance can be ascribed to the 2D structure which has a larger internal surface area, more catalytically active sites, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.

         <title>Unravelling the Hydration Barrier of Lignin Oleate Nanoparticles for Acid&#8208; and Base&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization in Dispersion State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) are demonstrated for functionalization in aqueous dispersion under acidic (pH&#8197;2) and basic (pH&#8197;12) conditions owing to the hydration barrier effect provided by oleic acid chains in the shells of OLNPs. Covalent functionalization of these nanoparticles using robust chemistries opens new avenues such as functional anticorrosive coatings and pH&#8208;switchable adsorbents for removal of organic dyes from wastewater.







Abstract
Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are promising renewable nanomaterials with applications ranging from biomedicine to water purification. However, the instability of LNPs under acidic and basic conditions severely limits their functionalization for improved performance. Here, we show that controlling the degree of esterification can significantly improve the stability of lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) in acidic and basic aqueous dispersions. The high stability of OLNPs is attributed to the alkyl chains accumulated in the shell of the particle, which delays protonation/deprotonation of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl groups. Owing to the enhanced stability, acid&#8208; and base&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of OLNPs at pH&#8197;2.0 and pH&#8197;12.0 via oxirane ring&#8208;opening reactions were successfully performed. We also demonstrated these new functionalized particles as efficient pH&#8208;switchable dye adsorbents and anticorrosive particulate coatings.

Enantioselective synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkyne&#8208;bearing malononitrile and terminal alkynes using a desymmetrization strategy. The regioselectivity of pyridine is controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.







Abstract
A Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition for synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed. The regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities are controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Pyridines with 5&#8208;substitutents could be obtained with &gt;20:1 regioselectivity and up to 94&#8201;% ee when terminal alkyl, alkenyl or silyl alkynes and DTBM/Ph&#8208;based NPN* ligand L6 were used. Terminal aryl alkynes and Ph/Bn&#8208;based ligand L4 leads to formation of pyridines with 6&#8208;substitutents in up to 99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;Based Photodynamic Agents for Exclusively Generating Superoxide Radical over Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizers generate ROS exclusively by the Type&#8208;I process upon near&#8208;infrared light illumination for tumor ablation.







Abstract
Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers is considered as an efficient approach to overcome the deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) for hypoxic tumors. However, it remains a challenge to design photosensitizers for generating reactive oxygen species by the Type&#8208;I process. Herein, we report a series of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;linked BODIPY dimers and a trimer that exclusively generate superoxide radical (O2&#8722;.) by the Type&#8208;I process upon light irradiation. The triplet formation originates from an effective excited&#8208;state relaxation from the initially populated singlet (S1) to triplet (T1) states via an intermediate triplet (T2) state. The low reduction potential and ultralong lifetime of the T1 state facilitate the efficient generation of O2&#8722;. by inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer to molecular oxygen. The energy gap of T1&#8208;S0 is smaller than that between 3O2 and 1O2 thereby precluding the generation of singlet oxygen by the Type&#8208;II process. The trimer exhibits superior PDT performance under the hypoxic environment.

         <title>Enzymatic Tailoring in Luzopeptin Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome&#8197;P450&#8208;Mediated Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Desaturation for Hydrazone Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luzopeptins are potent antitumor and antiviral agents with their biological activities controlled by rare modified tetrahydropyridazine structural subunits. Reconstitution of the tailoring pathway in luzopeptin&#8197;A biosynthesis reveals the molecular basis of this key pharmacophore formation, which involves unusual carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation by multitasking cytochrome&#8197;P450 and extracellular O&#8208;acetylation by integral membrane acyltransferase.







Abstract
Luzopeptins and related decadepsipeptides are bisintercalator nonribosomal peptides featuring rare acyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (Thp) subunits that are critical to their biological activities. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic tailoring pathway in luzopeptin&#8197;A biosynthesis through in vivo genetic and in vitro biochemical approaches. Significantly, we revealed a multitasking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that catalyzes four consecutive oxidations including the highly unusual carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation, forming the hydrazone&#8208;bearing 4&#8208;OH&#8208;Thp residues. Moreover, we identified a membrane&#8208;bound acyltransferase that likely mediates the subsequent O&#8208;acetylation extracellularly, as a potential self&#8208;protective strategy for the producer strain. Further genome mining of novel decadepsipeptides and an associated P450 enzyme have provided mechanistic insights into the P450&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation. Our results not only reveal the molecular basis of pharmacophore formation in bisintercalator decadepsipeptides, but also expand the catalytic versatility of P450 family enzymes.

Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the synthesis of medicinally relevant &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from abundant tertiary amides or lactams, carboxylic acids, and (N&#8208;isocyanimino) triphenylphosphorane, is described. Proceeding under mild conditions using (&lt;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2) and tetramethyldisiloxane to access the key reactive iminium ion intermediates, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole architectures were accessed from carboxylic acid feedstock coupling partners. Extension to &#945;&#8208;amino heterodiazole synthesis was readily achieved by exchanging the carboxylic acid coupling partner for C&#8208;, S&#8208;, or N&#8208;centered Br&#248;nsted acids, and provided rapid and modular access to these desirable, yet difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access, heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalytic reductive activation step allowed late&#8208;stage functionalization of 10 drug molecules, including the synthesis of heterodiazole&#8208;fused drug&#8211;drug conjugates.

         <title>Configuration Sampling With Five&#8208;Membered Atropisomeric P,N&#8208;Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of a small series of atropisomeric, C1&#8208;symmetric P,N&#8208;ligands that incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket is reported. This enables sampling of chiral space without modifying the steric parameters of the substituents. As a demonstration of the utility, using this small series of stack ligands, a P,N ligand was identified for the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;borylation of Michael acceptors.







Abstract
Here we report a strategy for the systematic variation of atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric P,N ligands to incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket without modifying their steric parameters. More specifically, the effects of systematic modification of the nitrogen heterocycle in atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric stack ligands have been investigated in this study. The versatility and applicability of this approach has been demonstrated in mechanistically distinct catalytic enantioselective transformations, resulting in the identification of a P,N&#8208;ligand for a highly enantioselective synthesis of organoboranes.

         <title>Crystalline Sponge Method: X&#8208;ray Structure Analysis of Small Molecules by Post&#8208;Orientation within Porous Crystals&#8212;Principle and Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Studies</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystal growth is not needed for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis when the crystalline sponge method is used. This method makes use of single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (&#8220;crystalline sponges&#8221;) that can absorb small guest molecules within the pores and make the absorbed guests observable by conventional single&#8208;crystal diffraction. This Review focuses on the principles of this approach as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies.







Abstract
This Review discusses, along with the historical background, the principles as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies of the crystalline sponge (CS) method, a new single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) method for the analysis of the structures of small molecules without sample crystallization. The method uses single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (crystalline sponges) that can absorb small guest molecules within their pores. The absorbed guest molecules are ordered in the pores through molecular recognition and become observable by conventional SCXRD analysis. The complex {[(ZnI2)3(tpt)2]&#8901;x(solvent)}n (tpt=tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine) was first proposed as a crystalline sponge and has been most generally used. Crystalline sponges developed later are also discussed here. The principle of the CS method can be described as &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; of the absorbed guest, whose ordering is templated by the pre&#8208;latticed cavities. The method has been widely applied to synthetic chemistry as well as natural product studies, for which proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples will be shown here.

         <title>Dynamic Catalytic Highly Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselectively catalyzed dynamic covalent one&#8208;pot&#8208;tandem 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to &#945;&#8242;&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones is described. Time&#8208;dependend enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis was achieved by using the same set of reagents. A reversible cycloaddition of the kinetically favored product enables the interconversion to its more stable thermodynamically favored product through a chiral complex&#8208;mediated process.







Abstract
In dynamic covalent chemistry, reactions follow a thermodynamically controlled pathway through equilibria. Reversible covalent&#8208;bond formation and breaking in a dynamic process enables the interconversion of products formed under kinetic control to thermodynamically more stable isomers. Notably, enantioselective catalysis of dynamic transformations has not been reported and applied in complex molecule synthesis. We describe the discovery of dynamic covalent enantioselective metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. We have developed a stereodivergent tandem synthesis of structurally and stereochemically complex molecules that generates eight stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity through asymmetric reversible bond formation in a dynamic process in two consecutive Ag&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylides with electron&#8208;poor olefins. Time&#8208;dependent reversible dynamic covalent&#8208;bond formation gives enantiodivergent and diastereodivergent access to structurally complex double cycloadducts with high selectivity from a common set of reagents.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Cascade of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones by Dipeptided Phosphonium Salt Catalysis: Stereospecific Construction of Dihydrofuro&#8208;Fused [2,3&#8208;b] Skeletons</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cascade reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with 2&#8208;nitroindoles, 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes was achieved through dipeptide&#8208;phoaphonium salt catalysis. Three types of structurally fused heterocycles were obtained in excellent stereoselectivities. Regioselectivities were determined by the low reaction energy resulting from the initial &#945;&#8208;addition but not &#947;&#8208;addition.







Abstract
Chiral (dihydro)furo&#8208;fused heterocycles are significant structural motifs in numerous natural products, functional materials and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing efficient methods for preparing compounds with these privileged scaffolds is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cascade reaction of readily available linear &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with aromatic alkenes, affording a wide variety of structurally fused heterocyclic molecules in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that the bifunctional phosphonium salt controlled the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of this cascade reaction, particularly proceeding through the initial ketone &#945;&#8208;addition followed by O&#8208;participated substitution; and the multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between Br&#248;nsted acid moieties of catalyst and nitro group of aromatic alkene were crucial in asymmetric induction. Given the generality, versatility, and high efficiency of this method, we anticipate that it will have broad synthetic utilities.

         <title>Intermolecular [5+2] Annulation between 1&#8208;Indanones and Internal Alkynes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;C Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] annulation between 1&#8208;indanones and alkynes is reported. It provides a rapid and straightforward entry to benzocycloheptenones. DFT calculation reveals the beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the ligand and the substrate in the turnover&#8208;limiting migration insertion step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a [5+2] cycloaddition between readily accessible 1&#8208;indanones and internal alkynes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed activation of less strained C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction is enabled by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligand and a carefully modified temporary directing group. A wide range of functional groups is tolerated, and the method provides straightforward access to diverse benzocycloheptenones that are hard to access otherwise. DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the transition states.

         <title>Temporal Control over Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;State Living Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization for Modulating the Molecular Weight Distribution Profile of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and successful demonstration of a highly versatile new strategy for manipulating the molecular weight distribution profiles of a variety of different polyolefins is reported. It involves temporal control over two&#8208; and three&#8208;state living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of olefins in a programmable way.







Abstract
A highly versatile new strategy for manipulating the molecular weight profiles, including breadth, asymmetry (skewness) and modal nature (mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and multimodal), of a variety of different polyolefins is reported. It involves temporal control over two&#8208; and three&#8208;state living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of olefins in a programmable way. By changing the identity of the R&#8242; groups of the chain transfer agent, ER&#8242;n, with time, different populations of chains within a bi&#8208; or multimodal polyolefin product can be selectively tagged with different end&#8208;groups. By changing the nature of the main&#8208;group metal of the CTA, programmed manipulation of the relative magnitudes of the dispersities of the different maxima that make up the final MWD profile can be achieved. This strategy can be implemented with existing LCCTP materials and conventional reactor methods to provide access to scalable and practical quantities of an unlimited array of new polyolefin materials.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Protoboration of CF3&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel copper&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;dienes with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry afforded the CF3&#8208;containing borated products with good selectivity and efficiency.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diene with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry could suppress the well&#8208;known defluorination and provide borated reagents with an intact CF3&#8208;group. Further studies indicated that the functional group tolerance of this chemistry is very well, and the products could be used as versatile precursors for different types of transformations. Importantly, using chiral diphosphine ligand, we have developed the first example for using such starting material to synthesis allylic boron&#8208;reagents which bearing a CF3&#8208;containing chiral center. Notably, the reaction mechanism was intensively studied by DFT calculations, which could reveal the reason that defluorination was inhibited.

         <title>Macrolactonization Reactions Driven by a Pentafluorobenzoyl Group**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old made new again: The onset of macrolactonizations can be initiated using the inexpensive pentafluorobenzoyl chloride as an activating agent to deliver a large variety of macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with high efficiency through a robust protocol. Notably, this process could be easily extended to less reactive phenol derivatives.







Abstract
Macrolactones constitute a privileged class of natural and synthetic products with a broad range of applications in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Despite all the progress made towards their synthesis, notably from seco&#8208;acids, a macrolactonization promoter system that is effective, selective, flexible, readily available, and, insofar as possible, compatible with manifold functional groups is still lacking. Herein, we describe a strategy that relies on the formation of a mixed anhydride incorporating a pentafluorophenyl group which, due to its high electronic activation enables a convenient access to macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with a broad versatility. Kinetic studies and DFT computations were performed to rationalize the reactivity of the pentafluorophenyl group in macrolactonization reactions.

         <title>Chemically Stabilized DNA Barcodes for DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded compound libraries (DELs) are a widely used screening technology. DNA reactivity limits the reaction scope for library synthesis. Substituting the purines by 7&#8208;deazaadenine yielded functional DNA barcodes with enhanced chemical stability. Controlled pore glass&#8208;coupled barcodes tolerated isocyanide multicomponent reactions, the acid&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, and YbIII&#8208; and AuI&#8208;mediated pyrazole syntheses for DEL design.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded compound libraries are a widely used small molecule screening technology. One important aim in library design is the coverage of chemical space through structurally diverse molecules. Yet, the chemical reactivity of native DNA barcodes limits the toolbox of reactions for library design. Substituting the chemically vulnerable purines by 7&#8208;deazaadenine, which exhibits tautomerization stability similar to natural adenine with respect to the formation of stable Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, yielded ligation&#8208;competent, amplifiable, and readable DNA barcodes for encoded chemistry with enhanced stability against protic acid&#8208; and metal ion&#8208;promoted depurination. The barcode stability allowed for straightforward translation of 16 exemplary reactions that included isocyanide multicomponent reactions, acid&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler and Biginelli reactions, and metal&#8208;promoted pyrazole syntheses on controlled pore glass&#8208;coupled barcodes for diverse DEL design. The Boc protective group of reaction products offered a convenient handle for encoded compound purification.

         <title>Formation and Cycloaddition Reactions of a Reactive Boraalkene Stabilized Internally by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily available cyclic boraalkene contains a neutral B=C functionality. The reactive polar main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bond undergoes an unusual series of reactions upon addition of various small molecules, such as carbon dioxide, N2O or elements, such as selenium.







Abstract
The synthesis of element&#8722;carbon double bonds is of great importance for the development and understanding of reactive &#960;&#8208;bonded systems in chemistry. The seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic system 4&#8201;b is readily made by internal C&#8722;H activation at a pendent isopropyl methyl group of the respective [(IPr)C6F5BH]+ borenium ion. Subsequent deprotonation with the IMes carbene gives the neutral cyclic boraalkene system 5&#8201;b. The B=C double bond in compound 5&#8201;b adds carbon dioxide, CS2, sulfur dioxide, phenyl isocyanate, an acetylenic ester or two NO molecules to give the corresponding four&#8208;membered ring annulated heterocycles. With sulfur or selenium 5&#8201;b gives the respective three&#8208;membered ring systems. N2O reacts with 5&#8201;b to give a mixture of the related oxaborirane 18 and a unique [B]OH containing diazoalkane product 19.

         <title>Expanding the Occurrence of Polysaccharides to the Viral World: The Case of Mimivirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The giant virus Mimivirus has an icosahedral capsid embedded in a thick layer of fibrils, resembling the glycocalyx of many bacteria. This study revealed that these fibrils are composed by a limited set of carrier proteins which bear two distinct polysaccharides. The presence of polysaccharides refutes the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses and opens new avenues in the field of glycosciences and viral biology.







Abstract
The general perception of viruses is that they are small in terms of size and genome, and that they hijack the host machinery to glycosylate their capsid. Giant viruses subvert all these concepts: their particles are not small, and their genome is more complex than that of some bacteria. Regarding glycosylation, this concept has been already challenged by the finding that Chloroviruses have an autonomous glycosylation machinery that produces oligosaccharides similar in size to those of small viruses (6&#8211;12 units), albeit different in structure compared to the viral counterparts. We report herein that Mimivirus possesses a glycocalyx made of two different polysaccharides, now challenging the concept that all viruses coat their capsids with oligosaccharides of discrete size. This discovery contradicts the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses, blurring the boundaries between giant viruses and the cellular world and opening new avenues in the field of viral glycobiology.

&lt;p&gt;The giant virus Mimivirus has an icosahedral capsid embedded in a thick layer of fibrils, resembling the glycocalyx of many bacteria. This study revealed that these fibrils are composed by a limited set of carrier proteins which bear two distinct polysaccharides. The presence of polysaccharides refutes the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses and opens new avenues in the field of glycosciences and viral biology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general perception of viruses is that they are small in terms of size and genome, and that they hijack the host machinery to glycosylate their capsid. Giant viruses subvert all these concepts: their particles are not small, and their genome is more complex than that of some bacteria. Regarding glycosylation, this concept has been already challenged by the finding that Chloroviruses have an autonomous glycosylation machinery that produces oligosaccharides similar in size to those of small viruses (6&#8211;12 units), albeit different in structure compared to the viral counterparts. We report herein that Mimivirus possesses a glycocalyx made of two different polysaccharides, now challenging the concept that all viruses coat their capsids with oligosaccharides of discrete size. This discovery contradicts the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses, blurring the boundaries between giant viruses and the cellular world and opening new avenues in the field of viral glycobiology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Mild Intermolecular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Incorporated Tricyclic Skeleton: Unusual Reactivity of Isobenzopyryliums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes embedded in a polycyclic bridged architecture are a versatile structural motif, but such complex frameworks often impose substantial synthetic challenges. Herein we introduce a new approach for the expedient access to such spring&#8208;loaded strained systems via an exceptionally mild intermolecular convergent process between the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinylboronic acids. Different from the typical conventional approaches, our protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions in order to overcome the disfavored kinetic and thermodynamic problems. Instead, the key cyclopropane ring was formed between the well&#8208;positioned nucleophile and electrophile in the adduct from the regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition. Thus, this unusual process also represents a new reactivity of the versatile isobenzopyryliums. The choice of a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst with proper acidity is crucial to the high efficiency and selectivity for this multiple bond&#8208;forming process. The strained products are precursors to other useful synthetic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it&#8217;s still a great challenge to develop heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8208;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>AgII&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Ambient CH4 Functionalization Inspired by HSAB Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18152-18161, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the HSAB theory, we explored the electrocatalytic CH4 functionalization mediated by AgII metalloradical, the last class (b) transition metal whose reactivity towards CH4 is unknown. Detailed mechanistic investigation unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH4 activation up to 2.8&#215;103&#8197;h&#8722;1 at room temperature.







Abstract
Although most class (b) transition metals have been studied in regard to CH4 activation, divalent silver (AgII), possibly owing to its reactive nature, is the only class (b) high&#8208;valent transition metal center that is not yet reported to exhibit reactivities towards CH4 activation. We now report that electrochemically generated AgII metalloradical readily functionalizes CH4 into methyl bisulfate (CH3OSO3H) at ambient conditions in 98&#8201;% H2SO4. Mechanistic investigation experimentally unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH4 activation up to 2.8&#215;103&#8197;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and a CH4 pressure of 85&#8197;psi, and two competing reaction pathways preferable towards CH4 activation over solvent oxidation. Reaction kinetic data suggest a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% beyond 180&#8197;psi CH4 at room temperature for potential chemical production from widely distributed natural gas resources with minimal infrastructure reliance.

         <title>Thermal Unequilibrium of PdSn Intermetallic Nanocatalysts: From In Situ Tailored Synthesis to Unexpected Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18309-18317, August 9, 2021. </description>

Metastable PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles are made through a rapid quenching method, inspired by in situ characterization results. PdSn shows unprecedented high hydrogenation selectivity of C=O over C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Effective control on chemoselectivity in the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O over C=C bonds is uncommon with Pd&#8208;based catalysts because of the favored adsorption of C=C bonds on Pd surface. Here we report a unique orthorhombic PdSn intermetallic phase with unprecedented chemoselectivity toward C=O hydrogenation. We observed the formation and metastability of this PdSn phase in situ. During a natural cooling process, the PdSn nanoparticles readily revert to the favored Pd3Sn2 phase. Instead, using a thermal quenching method, we prepared a pure&#8208;phase PdSn nanocatalyst. PdSn shows an &gt;96&#8201;% selectivity toward hydrogenating C=O bonds of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, highest in reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Further study suggests that efficient quenching prevents the reversion from PdSn&#8208; to Pd3Sn2&#8208;structured surface, the key to the desired catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations and analysis of reaction kinetics provide an explanation for the observed high selectivity.

         <title>Capture and Separation of SO2 Traces in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Pre&#8208;Synthetic Pore Environment Tailoring by Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17998-18005, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment tailoring strategy has been applied to improve low&#8208;pressure SO2 affinity on stable isostructural methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs by controlling methyl groups density. Enhanced low&#8208;pressure SO2 uptake and SO2 separation was achieved. This work provides a facile strategy to obtain tailor&#8208;made MOF adsorbents for challenging gas purification applications.







Abstract
Herein, we report a pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO2 binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO2 adsorption and SO2/CO2 separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni2(BDC&#8208;X)2DABCO] (BDC&#8208;X=mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO2 affinity over the parent MOF. The SO2 separation potential by methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated and experimental breakthrough curves, and DFT calculations.

Enhanced low-pressure SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation was achieved. This work provides a facile strategy to obtain tailor-made MOF adsorbents for challenging gas purification applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a pre-synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl-functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BDC-X)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DABCO] (BDC-X=mono-, di-, and tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO=1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity over the parent MOF. The SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation potential by methyl-functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated and experimental breakthrough curves, and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Binding&#8208;Initiated Activation of O&#8722;H Bonds on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Surface for the Catalytic Oxidation of Biomass Hydroxyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18103-18110, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#916;G0 value of on&#8208;surface hydrogen binding was obtained from the chemical&#8208;shift change of the involved protons and the variation of acceptor concentrations via NMR. This reflects the ability of the catalyst surface to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups. The on&#8208;surface hydrogen&#8208;binding was successfully employed to drive the initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in probing the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural with Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen binding of molecules on solid surfaces is an attractive interaction that can be used as the driving force for bond activation, material&#8208;directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of a quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surfaces seriously limits its application. We measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G0) of on&#8208;surface HBs using NMR. The HB&#8208;accepting ability of the surface was investigated by comparing &#916;G0 values employing the model biomass platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;n catalysts with adjustable electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;doped contents. Decreasing &#916;G0 improves the HB&#8208;accepting ability of the nitrogen&#8208;doped surface and promotes the selectively initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated. In addition to the excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) for this oxidation is much higher than for reported non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts.

         <title>Monitoring Solid&#8208;Phase Reactions in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

A highly reproducible, homogeneous plasmonic substrate was fabricated by electron&#8208;beam lithography to detect the Raman fingerprints of molecular self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) at all points of the substrate with high uniformity. This substrate was employed for characterizing the intermediates and the product of a solid&#8208;phase synthesis in a SAM by SERS.







Abstract
Nanopatterned surfaces enhance incident electromagnetic radiation and thereby enable the detection and characterization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), for instance in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Herein, Au nanohole arrays, developed and characterized as SERS substrates, are exemplarily used for monitoring a solid&#8208;phase deprotection and a subsequent copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; reaction, performed directly on the corresponding SAMs. The SERS substrate was found to be highly reliable in terms of signal reproducibility and chemical stability. Furthermore, the intermediates and the product of the solid&#8208;phase synthesis were identified by SERS. The spectra of the immobilized compounds showed minor differences compared to spectra of the microcrystalline solids. With its uniform SERS signals and the high chemical stability, the platform paves the way for monitoring molecular manipulations in surface functionalization applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Intrablock Cross&#8208;Linking of Linear Diblock Copolymer to Realize Janus&#8208;Shaped Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18122-18128, August 9, 2021. </description>

A one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking protocol was demonstrated to achieve a rapid and facile synthesis of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs) from the various diblock copolymers bearing one particular cross&#8208;linkable functionality across the entire polymer chain. Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP produce significantly small microphase&#8208;separated structure.







Abstract
Developing an efficient and versatile process to transform a single linear polymer chain into a shape&#8208;defined nanoobject is a major challenge in the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology to replicate sophisticated biological functions of proteins and nucleic acids in a synthetic polymer system. In this study, we performed one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking of linear block copolymers (BCPs) to realize single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs). Detailed structural characterizations of the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP composed of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(glycolic acid) revealed its compactly folded conformation and compartmentalized block localization, similar to the self&#8208;folded tertiary structures of natural proteins. Versatility of the one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking was demonstrated using several different BCP precursors. In addition, the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP produce miniscule microphase&#8208;separated structures.

An asymmetric organocatalytic methodology for obtaining diverse trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder products with up to 86&#8201;% yield &gt;20:1 d.r. &gt;99&#8201;% ee and five stereocenters, of which one is a quaternary carbon, has been developed. This was achieved using a pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to increase reactivity and selectivity. An SN2&#8208;like substitution at a tertiary center transforms the fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder intermediate into the trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product.







Abstract
An enantioselective methodology to construct trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder scaffolds by organocatalysis with excellent selectivity, high yield and up to five contiguous stereocenters is presented. The reaction concept integrates the halogen effect and a novel discovered pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to direct an endo&#8208;selective, secondary&#8208;amine catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction allowing for the subsequent formation of trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadducts featuring the norcarene scaffold. The methodology relies on the reaction between an in situ generated trienamine and an &#945;&#8208;brominated or &#945;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;halogenated enone to form a fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder intermediate. The endo&#8208;transition state&#8208;enhanced by the (pseudo&#8208;)halogen effect&#8208;sets the stereochemistry that allows for a subsequent SN2&#8208;like reaction at a tertiary center to obtain the trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder scaffold. The mechanism was investigated and supported by experimental results as well as computational studies.

Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, a unique cubic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions arranged in a diamond topology is reported. Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF is a highly crystalline, porous and deep black material featuring high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a unique cubic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions, arranged in a diamond topology. The MOF is synthesized under solvothermal conditions, yielding a highly crystalline, deep black powder, with crystallites of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm size and tetrahedral morphology. Nitrogen sorption analysis indicates a highly porous material with a surface area exceeding 1400&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF shows broadband absorption from 475 up to 1900&#8197;nm with excellent absorption capability of 98.5&#8201;% of the incoming light over the visible spectral region. Electrical conductivity measurements of pressed pellets reveal a high intrinsic electrical conductivity of up to 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Quantum mechanical calculations predict Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF to be an efficient electron conductor, exhibiting continuous charge&#8208;carrier pathways throughout the structure.

         <title>Tricomponent Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymers with Tunable Composition via Sequential Seeded Growth</title>

Synthesis of tricomponent supramolecular block copolymers with tunable microstructure is demonstrated by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide derivatives.







Abstract
Synthesis of supramolecular block co&#8208;polymers (BCP) with small monomers and predictive sequence requires elegant molecular design and synthetic strategies. Herein we report the unparalleled synthesis of tri&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs with tunable microstructure by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomers. Core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivatives with different core substitutions and appended with &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide side chains provide perfect monomer design with spectral complementarity, pathway complexity and minimal structural mismatch to synthesize and characterize the multi&#8208;component BCPs. The distinct fluorescent nature of various cNDI monomers aids the spectroscopic probing of the seeded growth process and the microscopic visualization of resultant supramolecular BCPs using Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization presented here is reminiscent of the multi&#8208;step synthesis of covalent BCPs via living chain polymerization. These findings provide a promising platform for constructing unique functional organic heterostructures for various optoelectronic and catalytic applications.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Conversion to Methanol in a Bifunctional Zeolite Catalytic Membrane Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18289-18294, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalytic membrane reactor is developed for CO2 conversion to methanol, in which CO2 conversion to methanol and the by&#8208;product water removal by hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane is realized simultaneously. Attributing to in situ and continuous removal of water from the reaction system, the equilibrium limitation of CO2 conversion to methanol is broken, leading to a significant enhancement of CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of sequestrated CO2 to methanol can reduce CO2 emission and establish a sustainable carbon circuit. However, the transformation of CO2 into methanol is challenging because of the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and the deactivation of catalysts by water. In the present work, different reactor types have been evaluated for CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to methanol. Best results have been obtained in a bifunctional catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) based on a zeolite LTA membrane and a catalytic Cu&#8208;ZnO&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;ZrO2 layer on top. Due to the in situ and rapid removal of the produced water from the catalytic layer through the hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane, it is effective to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, thus significantly increasing the CO2 conversion (36.1&#8201;%) and methanol selectivity (100&#8201;%). Further, the catalyst deactivation by the produced water can be effectively inhibited, thus maintaining a high long&#8208;term activity of the CMR.

Parallel, automated, and practical multicomponent reaction synthesis of high diversity acrylamides/ester libraries and HT protein crystallography (PX) yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. More general, integration of HT PX and HT synthesis into the &#8220;design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze&#8221; cycle will open unprecedented horizons in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Protein crystallography (PX) is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to discover medicinal chemistry starting points by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in PX could allow for a more integrated role into early drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput PX. We describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to acrylamides and &#8208;esters from diverse building blocks suitable for mmol scale synthesis on 96&#8208;well format and on a high&#8208;throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. High&#8208;throughput PX of our libraries efficiently yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of in situ HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT PX has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.

         <title>Synergistic Polarization Engineering on Bulk and Surface for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18303-18308, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic polarization engineering on bulk and on the surface of Bi4Ti3O12 is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting, which strengthen ferroelectric polarization for facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and enrich the reactive sites, largely improving the photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 into CO.







Abstract
Sluggish charge kinetics and low CO2 affinity seriously inhibit CO2 photoreduction. Herein, the synchronous promotion of charge separation and CO2 affinity of Bi4Ti3O12 is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting. Corona poling enhances ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12 by aligning the domains direction, which profoundly promotes charge transfer along opposite directions across bulk. Surface I&#8208;grafting forms a surface local electric field for further separating charge carriers and provides abundant active sites to enhance CO2 adsorption. The two modifications cooperatively further increase the ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12, which maximize the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, resulting in an enhanced CO production rate of 15.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (nearly 9 times) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. This work discloses that ferroelectric polarization and surface ion grafting can promote CO2 photoreduction in a synergistic way.

&lt;p&gt;Synergistic polarization engineering on bulk and on the surface of Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I-grafting, which strengthen ferroelectric polarization for facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and enrich the reactive sites, largely improving the photocatalytic activity for reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sluggish charge kinetics and low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity seriously inhibit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. Herein, the synchronous promotion of charge separation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity of Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I-grafting. Corona poling enhances ferroelectric polarization of Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; by aligning the domains direction, which profoundly promotes charge transfer along opposite directions across bulk. Surface I-grafting forms a surface local electric field for further separating charge carriers and provides abundant active sites to enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. The two modifications cooperatively further increase the ferroelectric polarization of Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which maximize the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, resulting in an enhanced CO production rate of 15.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (nearly 9 times) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. This work discloses that ferroelectric polarization and surface ion grafting can promote CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction in a synergistic way.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Modification of Active Matrix Metalloproteases: Activity&#8208;based Probes with no Photolabile Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18272-18279, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes have been designed that react with matrix metalloproteases active sites without any external trigger. These phosphinic pseudo peptide probes displayed a preference for human matrix metalloelastase hMMP&#8208;12 and were capable of selectively labelling human and mouse MMP&#8208;12 in complex proteomes.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes enable discrimination between the active enzyme and its inactive or inactivated counterparts. Since metalloproteases catalysis is non&#8208;covalent, activity&#8208;based probes targeting them have been systematically developed by decorating reversible inhibitors with photo&#8208;crosslinkers. By exploiting two types of ligand&#8208;guided chemistry, we identified novel activity&#8208;based probes capable of covalently modifying the active site of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) without any external trigger. The ability of these probes to label recombinant MMPs was validated in&#8197;vitro and the identity of the main labelling sites within their S3&#8242; region unambiguously assigned. We also demonstrated that our affinity probes can react with rhMMP12 at nanogram scale (that is, at 0.07&#8201;% (w/w)) in complex proteomes. Finally, this ligand&#8208;directed chemistry was successfully applied to label active MMP&#8208;12 secreted by eukaryote cells. We believe that this approach could be transferred more widely to many other metalloproteases, thus contributing to tackle their unresolved proteomic profiling in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>The Influence of a Changing Local Environment during Photoinduced CO2 Dissociation</title>

Following individual molecules and their changing environment during photoinduced dissociation reveals the importance of local changes during a reaction on its efficiency. Two counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;shaped reactivity.







Abstract
Though largely influencing the efficiency of a reaction, the molecular&#8208;scale details of the local environment of the reactants are experimentally inaccessible hindering an in&#8208;depth understanding of a catalyst's reactivity, a prerequisite to maximizing its efficiency. We introduce a method to follow individual molecules and their largely changing environment during a photochemical reaction. The method is illustrated for a rate&#8208;limiting step in a photolytic reaction, the dissociation of CO2 on two catalytically relevant surfaces, Ag(100) and Cu(111). We reveal with a single&#8208;molecule resolution how the reactant's surroundings evolve with progressing laser illumination and with it their propensity for dissociation. Counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;like reactivity. Our unprecedented local view during a photoinduced reaction opens the avenue for understanding the influence of the products on reaction yields on the nanoscale.

Viral untranslated regulatory regions (UTRs) contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic RNA structures crucial for viral replication. Combining in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8217; UTR of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 are created. Metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates are shown to bind at a bulge and junction, and in cell assays confirm that they inhibit viral infection.







Abstract
The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8242; UTR of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.

         <title>Ultrasmall Nanocapsules Obtained by Controlling Ostwald Ripening</title>

Ostwald ripening is used for reducing particle size in miniemulsions, providing a rapid and versatile method to synthesize silica nanocapsules with an ultrasmall size (ca. 6&#8197;nm) and a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology, even at low surfactant concentration. Aqueous solubility of solvents and reactivity of alkoxysilanes used in the synthesis are the key factors in controlling the formation of ultrasmall nanocapsules.







Abstract
We describe here a method to synthesize ultrasmall nanocapsules with a diameter of 6&#8197;nm, exhibiting a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology. Remarkably, the nanocapules are synthesized in a miniemulsion process without the need of large amounts of surfactant as commonly used in the microemulsion process. Ultrasmall nanocapsules with an oil core and a silica shell are formed by the concurrent processes of a sol&#8211;gel reaction and Ostwald ripening. Using solvents with different water solubilities and alkoxysilanes with different reactivities, we demonstrate that sizes of obtained nanocapsules depend on the ripening rate and alkoxysilane conversion rate. The method can be also used for encapsulating natural oils such as peppermint oil and limonene. This work shows that the Ostwald ripening phenomenon can be employed beneficially for the preparation of very small colloids.

Two modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) with same agents (small molecule scaffold module for construction and photodynamic reaction, module T for enhancing the internalization by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial arrangements are designed. T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with larger RGD binding angle performed higher specificities, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity.







Abstract
To overcome a series of challenges in tumor therapy, modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) comprised of various functional modules have been proposed. Researchers have tried to optimize the MAPs by exploiting the new modules or increasing the numbers of module, while neglecting the configuration of various modules. Here, we focus on the different spatial arrangements of existing modules. By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end&#8208;group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial arrangements (on the one side, TM&#8208;AIE, and two sides, T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with larger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity.

         <title>Access to and Reactivity of Fe0, Fe&#8722;I, FeI, and FeII PCcarbeneP Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18168-18177, August 9, 2021. </description>

We report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex. Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states.







Abstract
Despite their promising metal&#8211;ligand cooperative reactivity, PCcarbeneP pincer ligands are rarely reported for first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal centres. Using a dehydration methodology, we report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex (1) that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex (3). Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position in 1 is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI, and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states, as demonstrated with synthesis and characterization of the complexes [11&#8208;X][BArF20] (X=Br, I), 12, and K[13]. Compound K[13] is found to be highly reactive, and abstracts hydrogen from a range of aliphatic C&#8722;H sources. Computational analysis by DFT suggests that the formal FeI and Fe&#8722;I complexes contain significant carbene radical character. The ability of the PCcarbeneP ligand scaffold to partake in metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and to support a range of iron oxidation states renders it as potentially useful in many catalytic applications.

         <title>Selective Bacterial Targeting and Infection&#8208;Triggered Release of Antibiotic Colistin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17989-17997, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional peptide&#8211;colistin conjugate for the treatment of bacterial infections has been synthesized. The conjugate binds to E.&#8197;coli bacteria by an all&#8208;d sequence of the human peptide ubiquicidin29&#8211;41. Host immune cells, activated upon infection, secrete the enzyme neutrophil elastase that cleaves an optimized linker sequence to release free colistin, a potent antibiotic that kills the bacteria.







Abstract
In order to render potent, but toxic antibiotics more selective, we have explored a novel conjugation strategy that includes drug accumulation followed by infection&#8208;triggered release of the drug. Bacterial targeting was achieved using a modified fragment of the human antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin, as demonstrated by fluorophore&#8208;tagged variants. To limit the release of the effector colistin only to infection&#8208;related situations, we introduced a linker that was cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme secreted by neutrophil granulocytes at infection sites. The linker carried an optimized sequence of amino acids that was required to assure sufficient cleavage efficiency. The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1&#8208; or the 3&#8208;position of colistin. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept was achieved in co&#8208;cultures of primary human neutrophils and Escherichia coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.

         <title>Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxides with Ultra&#8208;Small Micropores for C2 Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18328-18334, August 9, 2021. </description>

Zeolitic cobalt molybdate was designed and synthesized for C2 hydrocarbon separation. The separation performance was able to be tuned by changing the composition of the material. The material showed good separation performance for C2 hydrocarbons even at high temperatures.







Abstract
Separation of C2 hydrocarbons, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2, remains significant challenges in chemical industry. However, there are only few adsorbents that can effectively isolate C2 hydrocarbons from their mixtures particularly at a high temperature. Herein, we design a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates with metal ion linkers. Single gas adsorption of the material shows the different adsorption performances for the C2 hydrocarbons and the strong interaction of the material with the C2 hydrocarbons. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates each of the binary C2 hydrocarbon mixtures and even the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixtures with high selectivity. The material keeps high separation performance even the temperature was increased to 85&#8201;&#176;C. The material is stable and is able to be reused without loss of the separation performance.

         <title>Unusual Surface Texture, Dimensions and Morphology Variations of Chiral and Single Crystals**

The egg&#8208;shaped homochiral crystals: A brain&#8208;like texture combined with single crystallinity. A series of isomorphous crystals found in a rare space group have been formed with varied morphologies. These crystals contain chiral channels and are made from achiral components.







Abstract
We demonstrate here a unique metallo&#8208;organic material where the appearance and the internal crystal structure are in contradiction. The egg&#8208;shaped (ovoid) crystals have a brain&#8208;like texture. Although these micro&#8208;sized crystals are monodispersed; like fingerprints their grainy surfaces are never exactly alike. Remarkably, our X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction studies unexpectedly revealed that these structures are single&#8208;crystals comprising a continuous coordination network of two differently shaped homochiral channels. By using the same building blocks under different reaction conditions, a rare series of crystals have been obtained that are uniquely rounded in their shape. In stark contrast to the brain&#8208;like crystals, these isostructural and monodispersed crystals have a comparatively smooth appearance. The sizes of these crystals vary by several orders of magnitude.

Although these micro-sized crystals are monodispersed; like fingerprints their grainy surfaces are never exactly alike. Remarkably, our X-ray and electron diffraction studies unexpectedly revealed that these structures are single-crystals comprising a continuous coordination network of two differently shaped homochiral channels. By using the same building blocks under different reaction conditions, a rare series of crystals have been obtained that are uniquely rounded in their shape. In stark contrast to the brain-like crystals, these isostructural and monodispersed crystals have a comparatively smooth appearance. The sizes of these crystals vary by several orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regulation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Emission Channels by Controlling the Excited&#8208;States Dynamics via J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregation</title>

         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates significantly reduce the energy gap between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and contribute to the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process; while H&#8208;aggregates will accelerate ISC and suppress radiation transition of S1 to realize phosphorescence. This provides crucial information for the deep undrstanding of the internal mechanism of the excited state dynamics controlled by different aggregates.







Abstract
Control of excited&#8208;state dynamics is key in tuning room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions but is challenging for organic luminescent materials (OLMs). We show the regulation of TADF and RTP emissions of a boron difluoride &#946;&#8208;acetylnaphthalene chelate (&#946;CBF2) by controlling the excited&#8208;state dynamics via its J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation states. Two crystalline polymorphs emitting green and red light have been controllably obtained. Although both monoclinic, the green and red crystals are dominated by J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation, respectively, owing to different molecular packing arrangements. J&#8208;aggregation significantly reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states for ultra&#8208;fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and enhances the radiative singlet decay, together leading to TADF. The H&#8208;aggregation accelerates the ISC and suppresses the radiative singlet decay, helping to stabilize the triplet exciton for RTP.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Transfer (PIET) Strategy for Selective Adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18223-18230, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using porous materials is a promising technique but a great challenge to achieve high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio. This work has developed a PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO2/C2H2 adsorption ratio for porous materials. These findings will promote the development of a new generation of CO2&#8208;selective adsorption technique in C2H2 production and inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.







Abstract
Similarities in sizes, shapes, and physical properties between carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetylene (C2H2) make it a great challenge to separate the major impurity CO2 from products in C2H2 production. The use of porous materials is an appealing path to replace current very costly and energy&#8208;consuming technologies, such as solvent extraction and cryogenic distillation; however, high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio with minor adsorption of C2H2 at standard pressure was only unexpectedly observed in scarce examples in recent years although the related research started early at 1950s, and general design strategies to realize this aim are still absent. This work has successfully developed an efficient PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO2/C2H2 adsorption ratio for porous materials in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MOF with a photochromism&#8208;active bipyridinium zwitterion. An unprecedented photocontrollable gate effect, owing to change of interannular dihedral after photoinduced generation of radical species, was also observed for the first time. These findings will inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Copper&#8211;Arylacetylide Polymerization and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18014-18021, August 9, 2021. </description>

For the first time, a copper&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibiting the characteristics of mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, and fast polymerization rate is presented. DFT calculations show that the polymerization is a thermodynamically favorable process. The resulting polymers exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties.







Abstract
Exploration of new polymerization reactions is very intriguing in fundamental and practical research, which will advance reaction theories and produce various functional materials. Herein, we report a new polymerization method based on the reaction of CuI and arylacetylide, which generates linear polymers with high molecular weight and low polydispersity index of molecular weight. The Cu&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibits different characteristics with traditional polymerizations such as mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, fast polymerization rate, and imprecise molar ratio between monomers. The bond formation path and activation energy of each step was investigated by density functional theory calculations to understand the reaction mechanism. The poly(Cu&#8208;arylacetylide)s exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties, which have been used to fabricate an electronic device for streptavidin sensing.

The first joint experimental&#8211;computational study of fluorocarbon adsorption into porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) reveals that the presence of structure defects leading to the creation of mesopores with a broad size range offers not only exceptional high&#8208;uptake adsorption of fluorocarbon R134a, but also unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms. COPs are thus proven to be excellent sorbent materials for cooling applications.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy&#8208;efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based on atomistic defect&#8208;containing models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for various defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defect&#8208;containing porous COPs are promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.

The acetonitrile&#8208;solvated [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; was prepared in order to compare and contrast its reactivity with the known [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; towards organic electrophiles. Both [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; and [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; successfully react with aryl iodonium and diazonium salts as well as alkynyl iodonium salts to give fluoroalkylated organic products. Electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)3]&#8722; suggests that, upon electro&#8208;oxidation to [(MeCN)nNiIII(C2F5)3], reductive homolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)2NiII(C2F5)2]. Catalytic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; or the related [Ni(CF3)4]2&#8722;. Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that &#8220;ligandless&#8221; nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF3 groups under catalytically relevant conditions.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Promotes In Vivo Bioorthogonal Reaction for Pretargeted Multimodality Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18082-18093, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pretargeted multimodality imaging strategy is based on a combination of the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the IEDDA reaction. A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a small&#8208;molecule probe is first activated by the target enzyme, leading to in situ self&#8208;assembly and enrichment of the TCOs. This allows subsequent labelling of radioisotopes via the IEDDA reaction, providing NIR FL, MRI and PET signals for in vivo imaging.







Abstract
Pretargeted imaging has emerged as a promising approach to advance nuclear imaging of malignant tumors. Herein, we combine the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction to develop an activatable pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging. The trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing small&#8208;molecule probe, P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, can be activated by alkaline phosphatase and in situ self&#8208;assembles into nanoaggregates (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) retained on the membranes, permitting to (1) amplify near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, and (2) enrich TCOs to promote IEDDA ligation. The Gallium&#8208;68 (68Ga) labeled tetrazine can readily conjugate the tumor&#8208;retained FMNPs&#8208;TCO to enhance radioactivity uptake in tumors. Strong NIR FL, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) signals are concomitantly achieved, allowing for pretargeted multimodality imaging of ALP activity in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

Unprecedentedly stable salts of the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate ion with different types of counterions were obtained on large scale. Deprotonation of the imidazolate ion provided access to the corresponding dianionic NHC that acts as ditopic ligand.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolate anion 1 was obtained in high yield from lithium imidazolate and B(CN)3&#8722;pyridine adduct. Anion 1 is chemically very robust and thus allowed the isolation of the corresponding H5O2+ salt. Furthermore, monoanion 1 served as starting species for the novel dianionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion 3 that acts as ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups at boron. First reactions of this new NHC 3 with methyl iodide, elemental selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] led to the methylated imidazolate ion 4, the dianionic selenium adduct 5, and the dianionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 6. These NHC derivatives provide a first insight into the electronic and steric properties of the dianionic NHC 3. Especially the combination of properties, such as double negative charge, different coordination sites, large buried volume and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability, make NHC 3 a unique and promising ligand and building block.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Methane to a Methyl Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18138-18143, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane is aerobically converted to an oxidation&#8208;resistant methyl ester in high yields with a solid cobalt&#8208;containing catalyst at a moderate temperature and pressure. Improved reaction conditions result from the dilution of the trifluoroacetic acid in an inert perfluoroalkane co&#8208;solvent. The fluorous character of the solvent enables the facile recovery of the product ester through a simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction with non&#8208;fluorous solvent.







Abstract
A promising strategy to break through the selectivity&#8208;conversion limit of direct methane conversion to achieve high yields is the protection of methanol via esterification to a more stable methyl ester. We present an aerobic methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester approach that utilizes a highly dispersed, cobalt&#8208;containing solid catalyst, along with significantly more favorable reaction conditions compared to existing homogeneously&#8208;catalyzed approaches (e.g. diluted acid, O2 oxidant, moderate temperature and pressure). The trifluoroacetic acid medium is diluted (&lt;25&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with an inert fluorous co&#8208;solvent that can be recovered after the separation of the methyl trifluoroacetate via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction at ambient conditions. Silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalysts are highly active in this system, with competitive yields and turnovers in comparison to known aerobic transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Introducing Intermolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for Water&#8208;Stable Low Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18265-18271, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskites are unstable in water due to the high water solubility of the A&#8208;site cations present in them. We introduce the intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between the A&#8208;site organic cations in 1D hybrid lead bromide perovskites. The cation&#8208;&#960; interactions make these 1D perovskites completely stable in water.







Abstract
Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociate in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long&#8208;range intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between A&#8208;site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A&#8208;site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;&#8208;TMDP)Pb2Br6], a one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions are obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is further extended to another A&#8208;site cation 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP), forming water&#8208;stable (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP)Pb2Br6 perovskite. These water&#8208;stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light&#8208;emitting diode and for light up&#8208;conversion through tunable third&#8208;harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water&#8208;resistant materials. The introduced cation&#8208;&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water&#8208;stable low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites.

     alt="Introducing Intermolecular Cation-&#960; Interactions for Water-Stable Low Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead halide perovskites are unstable in water due to the high water solubility of the A-site cations present in them. We introduce the intermolecular cation-&#960; interactions between the A-site organic cations in 1D hybrid lead bromide perovskites. The cation-&#960; interactions make these 1D perovskites completely stable in water.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociate in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long-range intermolecular cation-&#960; interactions between A-site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;-trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long-range cation-&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A-site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;-trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;-TMDP)Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], a one-dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation-&#960; interactions are obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long-range cation-&#960; interaction is further extended to another A-site cation 4,4&#8242;-ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;-EDP), forming water-stable (4,4&#8242;-EDP)Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. These water-stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light-emitting diode and for light up-conversion through tunable third-harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water-resistant materials. The introduced cation-&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water-stable low-dimensional hybrid perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;

Directed C&#8722;H functionalization has been realized to achieve borylation at a distal position of aliphatic amines. The oxidative borylation at the distal &#948;&#8208;position of aliphatic amines is achieved using various borylating agents, a palladium catalyst, and a rightly tuned ligand in the presence of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H&#8208;activated intermediate has been isolated and crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
Directed C&#8722;H functionalization has been realized as a complimentary technique to achieve borylation at a distal position of aliphatic amines. Here, we demonstrated the oxidative borylation at the distal &#948;&#8208;position of aliphatic amines using various borylating agents, a palladium catalyst, and a rightly tuned ligand in the presence of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H&#8208;activated intermediate has been isolated and crystallographically characterized to get mechanistic insight.

         <title>Precisely Engineered Supported Gold Clusters as a Stable Catalyst for Propylene Epoxidation</title>

A stable and selective Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst is synthesised for direct gas phase epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide, a key commodity chemical. The synthesis methodology is highly versatile for obtaining a stable, supported gold catalyst. The stabilising ligands play an important role in providing enhanced stability to the Au nanoparticles.







Abstract
Designing a stable and selective catalyst with high H2 utilisation is of pivotal importance for the direct gas&#8208;phase epoxidation of propylene. This work describes a facile one&#8208;pot methodology to synthesise ligand&#8208;stabilised sub&#8208;nanometre gold clusters immobilised onto a zeolitic support (TS&#8208;1) to engineer a stable Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst. A non&#8208;thermal O2 plasma technique is used for the quick removal of ligands with limited increase in particle size. Compared to untreated Au/TS&#8208;1 catalysts prepared using the deposition precipitation method, the synthesised catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance, including 10 times longer lifetime (&gt;20&#8197;days), increased PO selectivity and hydrogen efficiency in direct gas phase epoxidation. The structure&#8208;stability relationship of the catalyst is illustrated using multiple characterisation techniques, such as XPS, 31P MAS NMR, DR&#8208;UV/VIS, HRTEM and TGA. It is hypothesised that the ligands play a guardian role in stabilising the Au particle size, which is vital in this reaction. This strategy is a promising approach towards designing a more stable heterogeneous catalyst.

         <title>Fluorinated Poly&#8208;oxalate Electrolytes Stabilizing both Anode and Cathode Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li/NMC811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18335-18343, August 9, 2021. </description>

A family of F&#8208;terminated poly&#8208;oxalate structures were prepared, in which the odd&#8208;carbon&#8208;diol precursors endow higher Li+ conductivity. The terminal trifluoroacetate units not only help to generate a LiF&#8208;based passivating layer with the Li&#8208;metal anode, but also improve the antioxidative capability, with which the cycling performance of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal/NMC811 cells was significantly improved.







Abstract
The relatively narrow electrochemical steady window and low ionic conductivity are two critical challenges for Li+&#8208;conducting solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). Here, a family of poly&#8208;oxalate(POE) structures were prepared as SPE; among them, POEs composed from diols with an odd number of carbons show higher ionic conductivity than those composed from diols with an even number of carbons, and the POE composed from propanediol (C5&#8208;POE) has the highest Li+ conductivity. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) electrons of POE were found located on the terminal units. When using trifluoroacetate as the terminating unit (POE&#8208;F), not only does the HOMO become more negative, but also the HOMO electrons shift to the middle oxalate units, improving the antioxidative capability. Furthermore, the interfacial compatibility across the Li&#8208;metal/POE&#8208;F is also improved by the generation of a LiF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interlayer(SEI). With the trifluoroacetate&#8208;terminated C5&#8208;POE (C5&#8208;POE&#8208;F) as the electrolyte and Li+&#8208;conducting binder in the cathode, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2(NMC811) cells showed significantly improved stability than the counterpart with poly&#8208;ether, providing a promising candidate for the forthcoming all&#8208;solid&#8208;state high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Selective Permeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Channels on Lithium Metal for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18031-18036, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels, which were created by aminopropyl&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxanes anchored on the lithium metal surface, allow lithium ions to get through, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to their much larger volume. The selective lithium ion channels enable a prolonged cycle life and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are considered a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage. However, the strong reducibility and high reactivity of lithium lead to low Coulombic efficiency when contacting oxidants, such as lithium polysulfide caused by the serious &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein we design selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface, which allow lithium ions to pass through by electrochemical overpotential, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to the much larger steric hindrance than lithium ions. The selective permeation of lithium ions through the channels is further elucidated by the molecular simulation and visualization experiment. Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75&#8197;cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.

Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75&#8197;cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Light&#8208;Controllable Chemical Modulation of m6A RNA Methylation</title>

A route for the spatiotemporal control of intracellular RNA epigenetic modifications is presented. The agonism effect of a small compound can be concealed through appropriate photo&#8208;responsive caging groups, and the synthesized compounds exhibited a high sensitivity of external light irradiation and rapidly restored their effects in live cells.







Abstract
Bioactive small molecules with photo&#8208;removable protecting groups have provided spatial and temporal control of corresponding biological effects. We present the design, synthesis, computational and experimental evaluation of the first photo&#8208;activatable small&#8208;molecule methyltransferase agonist. By blocking the functional N&#8208;H group on MPCH with a photo&#8208;removable ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety, we have developed a promising photo&#8208;caged compound that had completely concealed its biological activity. Short UV light exposure of cells treated with that caged molecule in a few minutes resulted in a considerable hypermethylation of m6A modification in transcriptome RNAs, implicating a rapid release of the parent active compound. This study validates for the first time the photo&#8208;activatable small organic molecular concept in the field of RNA epigenetic research, which represents a novel tool in spatiotemporal and cellular modulation approaches.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of G&#8208;Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptor Polypharmacology</title>

Structure&#8208;based modelling was used to design a single compound with the ability to modulate the activity of two G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors relevant for Parkinson's disease. The most potent scaffold displayed nanomolar binding affinities for both targets and was active in a rat model of parkinsonism.







Abstract
Many diseases are polygenic and can only be treated efficiently with drugs that modulate multiple targets. However, rational design of compounds with multi&#8208;target profiles is rarely pursued because it is considered too difficult, in particular if the drug must enter the central nervous system. Here, a structure&#8208;based strategy to identify dual&#8208;target ligands of G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors is presented. We use this approach to design compounds that both antagonize the A2A adenosine receptor and activate the D2 dopamine receptor, which have excellent potential as antiparkinson drugs. Atomic resolution models of the receptors guided generation of a chemical library with compounds designed to occupy orthosteric and secondary binding pockets in both targets. Structure&#8208;based virtual screens identified ten compounds, of which three had affinity for both targets. One of these scaffolds was optimized to nanomolar dual&#8208;target activity and showed the predicted pharmacodynamic effect in a rat model of Parkinsonism.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Ion Batteries Achieved by a Low&#8208;Cost Glucose Additive</title>

A low&#8208;cost glucose additive into traditional ZnSO4 electrolyte can greatly inhibit the dendrite growth on Zn anodes in Zn ion batteries by simultaneously modulating the solvation shell in the electrolyte and electrode interface.







Abstract
Dendrite growth and by&#8208;products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their development as promising energy storage devices. We utilize a low&#8208;cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO4 electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high&#8208;performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, we show that the glucose in ZnSO4 aqueous environment can simultaneously modulate solvation structure of Zn2+ and Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering can alternate one H2O molecule from the primary Zn2+&#8208;6H2O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, a symmetric cell and Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>The Controllable Reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Electrolyte and Potential Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18178-18184, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOFs prior to CO2 electroreduction can be decoupled into two steps: 1)&#8197;electrolyte&#8208;mediated conversion of Bi&#8208;MOFs to Bi2O2CO3 by HCO3&#8722;&#8208;initiated ligand substitution, and 2)&#8197;potential&#8208;mediated reduction of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi. The first step controls the final morphology and structure, whilst the second step determines the final composition and valence states.







Abstract
Monitoring and controlling the reconstruction of materials under working conditions is crucial for the precise identification of active sites, elucidation of reaction mechanisms, and rational design of advanced catalysts. Herein, a Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) for electrochemical CO2 reduction is selected as a case study. In situ Raman spectra combined with ex situ electron microscopy reveal that the intricate reconstruction of the Bi&#8208;MOF can be controlled using two steps: 1)&#8197;electrolyte&#8208;mediated dissociation and conversion of Bi&#8208;MOF to Bi2O2CO3, and 2)&#8197;potential&#8208;mediated reduction of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi. The intentionally reconstructed Bi&#8197;catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and durability for formate production, and the unsaturated surface Bi&#8197;atoms formed during reconstruction become the active sites. This work emphasizes the significant impact of pre&#8208;catalyst reconstruction under working conditions and provides insight into the design of highly active and stable electrocatalysts through the regulation of these processes.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Microparticle Tension Sensors (&#956;TS) for Measuring Cell Mechanics in Non&#8208;planar Geometries and for High&#8208;Throughput Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18044-18050, August 9, 2021. </description>

A microparticle tension sensor is designed for measuring molecular forces in non&#8208;planar geometries and for high&#8208;throughput flow cytometry analysis of cell mechanics.







Abstract
Mechanotransduction, the interplay between physical and chemical signaling, plays vital roles in many biological processes. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques to quantify cell forces employ deformable polymer films or molecular probes tethered to glass substrates. However, the applications of these assays in fundamental and clinical research are restricted by the planar geometry and low throughput of microscopy readout. Herein, we develop a DNA&#8208;based microparticle tension sensor, which features a spherical surface and thus allows for investigation of mechanotransduction at curved interfaces. The micron&#8208;scale of &#956;TS enables flow cytometry readout, which is rapid and high throughput. We applied the method to map and measure T&#8208;cell receptor forces and platelet integrin forces at 12 and 56&#8197;pN thresholds. Furthermore, we quantified the inhibition efficiency of two anti&#8208;platelet drugs providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of &#956;TS to screen drugs that modulate cellular mechanics.

     alt="DNA-Based Microparticle Tension Sensors (&#956;TS) for Measuring Cell Mechanics in Non-planar Geometries and for High-Throughput Quantification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microparticle tension sensor is designed for measuring molecular forces in non-planar geometries and for high-throughput flow cytometry analysis of cell mechanics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanotransduction, the interplay between physical and chemical signaling, plays vital roles in many biological processes. The state-of-the-art techniques to quantify cell forces employ deformable polymer films or molecular probes tethered to glass substrates. However, the applications of these assays in fundamental and clinical research are restricted by the planar geometry and low throughput of microscopy readout. Herein, we develop a DNA-based microparticle tension sensor, which features a spherical surface and thus allows for investigation of mechanotransduction at curved interfaces. The micron-scale of &#956;TS enables flow cytometry readout, which is rapid and high throughput. We applied the method to map and measure T-cell receptor forces and platelet integrin forces at 12 and 56&#8197;pN thresholds. Furthermore, we quantified the inhibition efficiency of two anti-platelet drugs providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of &#956;TS to screen drugs that modulate cellular mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Crystalline COF Membranes from Amorphous Polymeric Membranes</title>

A disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation strategy is developed for the scalable fabrication of highly crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membrane from amorphous polymeric membrane via monomer exchange.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes hold potential for widespread applicability, but scalable fabrication is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation from amorphous polymeric membrane to crystalline COF membrane via monomer exchange. Solution processing is used to prepare amorphous membrane and the replacing monomer is selected based on the chemical and thermodynamical stability of the final framework. Reversible imine bonds allow the extraneous monomers to replace the pristine monomers within amorphous membrane, driving the transformation from disordered network to ordered framework. Incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds enables the crystalline COF to imprint the amorphous membrane morphology. The COF membranes harvest proton conductivity up to 0.53&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Our strategy bridges amorphous polymeric and crystalline COF membranes for large&#8208;scale fabrication of COF membranes and affords guidance on materials processing.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;like Supramolecular Iridium Catalysis Enabling C&#8722;H Bond Borylation of Pyridines with meta&#8208;Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18006-18013, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;based supramolecular catalyst has been designed to selectively recognize pyridine&#8208;like derivatives via secondary Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions. Owing to the distance between the substrate binding site and the active site as well as the geometrical constraints, meta&#8208;selective borylation reactions were accomplished displaying catalytic behaviors typically encountered in enzymes.







Abstract
The use of secondary interactions between substrates and catalysts is a promising strategy to discover selective transition metal catalysts for atom&#8208;economy C&#8722;H bond functionalization. The most powerful catalysts are found via trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening due to the low association constants between the substrate and the catalyst in which small stereo&#8208;electronic modifications within them can lead to very different reactivities. To circumvent these limitations and to increase the level of reactivity prediction in these important reactions, we report herein a supramolecular catalyst harnessing Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions that binds to pyridine&#8208;like substrates as tight as it can be found in some enzymes. The distance and spatial geometry between the active site and the substrate binding site is ideal to target unprecedented meta&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylations with enzymatic Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics, besides unique substrate selectivity and dormant reactivity patterns.

         <title>Influence of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemical Reactions of Redox Cofactor Solutions</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches the underlying mechanism of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven enhancement of Faradaic currents in solutions of redox cofactors, such as flavin mononucleotide, was investigated. The findings reveal that a magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect rather than radical pair mechanism is responsible for the observed current enhancement.







Abstract
Redox cofactors mediate many enzymatic processes and are increasingly employed in biomedical and energy applications. Exploring the influence of external magnetic fields on redox cofactor chemistry can enhance our understanding of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;sensitive biological processes and allow the application of magnetic fields to modulate redox reactions involving cofactors. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on electrochemical reactions in redox cofactor solutions. By employing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor as a model system, we characterize magnetically induced changes in Faradaic currents. We find that radical pair intermediates have negligible influence on current increases in FMN solution upon application of a magnetic field. The dominant mechanism underlying the observed current increases is the magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect. We extend our analyses to other diffusion&#8208;limited electrochemical reactions of redox cofactor solutions and arrive at similar conclusions, highlighting the opportunity to use this framework in redox cofactor chemistry.

         <title>A Family of Superhelicenes: Easily Tunable, Chiral Nanographenes by Merging Helicity with Planar &#960; Systems</title>

We present the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterization of a family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes that consist of HBCs fused via different five&#8208;membered rings. Despite being only a small part of the compounds, the nature of the five&#8208;membered rings has a huge impact on the properties of the whole molecule. We show the enantiomeric separation and circular dichroism properties together with X&#8208;ray analysis and charge transport calculations.







Abstract
We designed a straightforward synthetic route towards a full&#8208;fledged family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes: superhelicenes. They have two hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) in common that are connected via a central five&#8208;membered ring. By means of structurally altering this 5&#8208;membered ring, we realized a versatile library of molecular building blocks. Not only the superhelicene structure, but also their features are tuned with ease. In&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterizations served as a proof of concept thereof. The superhelicene enantiomers were separated, their circular dichroism was measured in preliminary studies and concluded with an enantiomeric assignment. Our work was rounded&#8208;off by crystal structure analyses. Mixed stacks of M&#8208; and P&#8208;isomers led to twisted molecular wires. Using such stacks, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities were calculated, giving reason to expect outstanding hole transporting properties.

         <title>Coupling Aptamer&#8208;based Protein Tagging with Metabolic Glycan Labeling for In Situ Visualization and Biological Function Study of Exosomal Protein&#8208;Specific Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18111-18115, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual labeling strategy for in situ visualization of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling (ExoAp&#8208;MGL) was used to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation is required for the interaction of exoPD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 and inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation.







Abstract
Exosomal glycoproteins play important roles in many physiological and pathological functions. Herein, we developed a dual labeling strategy based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling for visualizing glycosylation of specific proteins on exosomes. The glycosylation of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (exoPD&#8208;L1) was imaged in situ using intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent PD&#8208;L1 aptamers bound on exoPD&#8208;L1 and fluorescent tags on glycans introduced via metabolic glycan labeling. This method enables in situ visualization and biological function study of exosomal protein glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation was confirmed to be required in interaction with PD&#8208;1 and participated in inhibiting of CD8+ T cell proliferation. This is an efficient and non&#8208;destructive method to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation in situ, which provides a powerful tool for exosomal glycoproteomics research.

&lt;p&gt;A dual labeling strategy for in situ visualization of exosomal protein-specific glycosylation based on a protein-specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling (ExoAp-MGL) was used to study the presence and function of exosomal protein-specific glycosylation. Exosomal PD-L1 glycosylation is required for the interaction of exoPD-L1/PD-1 and inhibition of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell proliferation.

         <title>Improved Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Chiral Co3O4 Supraparticles under Electromagnetic Fields</title>

Chiral Co3O4 supraparticles (SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550&#8197;nm and paramagnetic performance were applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF). Compared to l&#8208;SPs, d&#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70&#8201;% in the 25&#8197;d of observation.







Abstract
One of the most common methods to treat thromboembolism is the use of thrombolytic drugs to activate fibrinolytic protease. The aim of this treatment was to initiate the lysis of fibrin; however, there are many side&#8208;effects associated with this form of treatment. Herein, we fabricated chiral Co3O4 supraparticles (SPs) with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550&#8197;nm and paramagnetic performance applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF). In vitro experiments showed that d&#8208;SPs degraded blood clot within 8&#8197;hours under MF. Compared to l&#8208;SPs, d&#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70&#8201;% in the 25&#8197;d of observation. The results of mechanism study showed that under MF, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by d&#8208;SPs were 1.5 times higher than that of l&#8208;SPs, which might be attributed to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effects.

         <title>Cycloaddition Cascades of Strained Alkynes and Oxadiazinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18201-18208, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational and experimental study on the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is reported. Mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs whereas the use of arynes leads to symmetrical PAHs, are investigated. Experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds.







Abstract
We report a computational and experimental study of the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The reaction proceeds by way of a pericyclic reaction cascade and leads to the formation of four new carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. Using M06&#8208;2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Carboxylate Ligands on Layered Double Hydroxides/Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Promote the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 18129-18137, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs demonstrate a synergistic effect. As a Lewis base the carboxylate ligands promote the sluggish OER by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of OH&#8722; ions, while also facilitating intrinsic electron redistribution and a partially distorted octahedral structure.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate ligands as co&#8208;catalysts are very efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in&#8208;situ&#8208;transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. We reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate an abundant high&#8208;valence state of nickel species with a partially distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d&#8208;band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of the intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in&#8197;situ Raman and FTIR spectra reveal that the surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH&#8722;).

Extreme gas&#8208;phase chemistry with the exotic transactinide dubnium and its lighter homologues tantalum and niobium is described by Nadine&#8197;M. Chiera, Tetsuya&#8197;K. Sato, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;17871. The sequence of volatility among Group&#8197;5 elements, as deduced from the behavior of their oxychloride compounds, is in agreement with Mendeleev's law, establishing dubnium as one of the least volatile elements of the periodic table.

Fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles have emerged as a highly attractive and promising platform for the visualisation of complex biological and pathological processes. This Minireview discusses different strategies based on polymeric nanoparticles for enhanced bioimaging applications. Solutions to overcome problems in the existing systems are also proposed.







Abstract
In recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have become increasingly popular for in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo bioimaging because of their excellent versatility and exceptional optical properties. Following a brief introduction on fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, as well as the merits of using polymeric NPs over other types of fluorescent probes, this Minireview gives a concise summary of key advances made in recent years (2017&#8211;2020) in the use of polymeric NPs for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. A particular focus is placed on various strategies used for enhanced bioimaging applications, including polymeric NPs that encapsulate near&#8208;infrared dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission fluorogens, cationic dyes doped with bulky hydrophobic counterions, and semiconducting polymers. Next, the current limitations in some of these polymeric NP systems are summarized and potential solutions offered to overcome them. Finally, some critical considerations in regard to the design of polymeric NPs are given for future bioimaging and sensing applications.

Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. This Minireview examines how recent work on capillary microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication.







Abstract
Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. The goal of this Minireview is to examine how recent work on microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication. It specifically focuses on capillary microfluidics since these devices are self&#8208;powered, easy to use, and well established for diagnostics and drug monitoring. Considering that an improvement in medication adherence can have a much larger effect than the development of new medical treatments, it is long overdue for the research communities working in chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and material sciences to consider developing technologies to enhance medication adherence. For these reasons, this Minireview is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to provide a quick starting point for researchers interested in joining this complex but intriguing and exciting field of research.

The generation of NiIII and excited NiII intermediates facilitates the reductive elimination step leading to the mild cross&#8208;couplings. This review provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches for mild C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations via homo&#8208; and heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis, electro&#8208; and nickel dual catalysis, as well as conventional zinc and nickel dual catalysis.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8208;heteroatom bonds represents an important type of bond&#8208;forming reaction in organic synthesis and often provides a fast and efficient access to privileged structures found in pharmaceuticals, agrochemical and materials. In contrast to conventional Pd&#8208; or Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings under high&#8208;temperature conditions, recent advances in homo&#8208; and heterogeneous Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom formations under mild conditions are particularly attractive from the standpoint of sustainability and practicability. The generation of NiIII and excited NiII intermediates facilitate the reductive elimination step to achieve mild cross&#8208;couplings. This review provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches for mild C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and highlights the developments in photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving SET and energy transfer processes; photoexcited nickel catalysis; electro and nickel dual catalysis; heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;CN), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs); as well as more conventional zinc and nickel dual catalyzed reactions.

Fuel cells are a powerful renewable energy technology. This review gives a comprehensive overview on oxygen reduction electrocatalysts towards practical fuel cells.







Abstract
Fuel cells are an incredibly powerful renewable energy technology, but their broad applications remains lagging because of the high cost and poor reliability of cathodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This review focuses on the recent progress of ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells. More importantly, it highlights the fundamental problems associated with the insufficient activity translation from rotating disk electrode to membrane electrode assembly in the fuel cells. Finally, for the atomic&#8208;level in&#8208;depth information on ORR catalysts in fuel cells, potential perspectives are suggested, including large&#8208;scale preparation, unified assessment criteria, advanced interpretation techniques, advanced simulation and artificial intelligence. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the fundamental science and technical engineering for efficient ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells.

         <title>A Trapezoidal Octacyanoquinoid Acceptor Forms Solution and Surface Products by Antiparallel Shape Fitting with Conformational Dipole Momentum Switch</title>

A new compound formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units is synthesized. Such species feature an in&#8208;plane to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane switch of the electric dipole momentum upon adsorption and self&#8208;assembly on Au(111).







Abstract
A new compound (1) formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units has been synthesized and studied by electrochemistry, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR, IR, EPR, and transient spectroscopy. Self&#8208;assembly of 1 on a Au(111) surface has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. Experiments have been rationalized by quantum chemical calculations. 1 exhibits a unique charge distribution in its anionic form, with a gradient of charge yielding a neat molecular in&#8208;plane electric dipole momentum, which transforms out&#8208;of&#8208;plane after surface deposition due to twisted&#8594;folded conformational change and to partial charge transfer from Au(111). Intermolecular van der Waals interactions and antiparallel trapezoidal shape fitting lead to the formation of an optimal dense on Au(111) two&#8208;dimensional assembly of 1.

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from an Octahedral TiIV Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17881-17886, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octahedral TiIV complex was used to construct the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with the edge transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 shows high crystallinity, superior stability, abundant porosity, and high photocatalytic activity for Meerwein addition reactions. This research will extend to enrich the structure and functionality of 3D frameworks.







Abstract
The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral TiIV complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86&#8197;eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.

         <title>Synthesizing Photoluminescent Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 Nanoclusters with Structural Features by Using a Combined Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17932-17936, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concurrently joint reduction&#8208;ligand induction method is introduced to synthesize a gold nanocluster Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the best PL quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably owing to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8722;Au bonds closely related to the structural features including tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two surface hexamer rings.







Abstract
We present a method for atomically precise nanocluster synthesis. As an illustration, we introduced the reducing&#8208;ligand induction combined method and synthesized a novel nanocluster, which was determined to be Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the same number of gold atoms as existing Au28(SR)20 nanoclusters but different ligands (hetero&#8208;composition&#8208;homo&#8208;size). Compared with the latter, the former has distinct properties and structures. In particular, a novel kernel evolution pattern is reported, i.e., the quasi&#8208;linear growth of Au4&#8208;tetrahedron by sharing one vertex and structural features, including a tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two Au6(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)6 hexamer chair&#8208;like rings on the kernel surface were also first reported, which endow Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the best photoluminescence quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably due to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8722;Au bonds.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H Heteroarylation via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17893-17897, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of decatungstate photocatalysis with oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover is reported. This strategy enables the C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation under mild conditions with excellent functional group tolerance. It was also adopted to enable late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable compounds. Microflow technology reduced reaction times and boosted productivity of the transformation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is a very powerful strategy for the regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we report on the unprecedented combination of decatungstate hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis with the oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover concept to access the direct net&#8208;oxidative C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation. The present methodology demonstrates a high functional group tolerance (40 examples) and is scalable when using continuous&#8208;flow reactor technology. The developed protocol is also amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant molecules such as stanozolol, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, podophyllotoxin, and dideoxyribose.

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Mitochondrial MicroRNAs via Optically Programmable Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17937-17941, August 9, 2021. </description>

An optically controlled DNA nanoreporter technology was reported for imaging of mitochondrial microRNAs in vitro and in vivo. This was accomplished by mitochondria&#8208;targeted localization and near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;initiated programmable strand displacement reactions.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) functions are tightly regulated by their sub&#8208;compartmental location in living cells, and the ability to imaging of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs) is essential for understanding of the related pathological processes. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based methods could not be used for this purpose. Here, we report the development of a DNA nanoreporter technology for imaging of mitomiRs in living cells through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNA strand displacement reactions. The sensing function of the DNA nanoreporters are silent (OFF) during the delivery process, but can be photoactivated (ON) with NIR light after targeted mitochondrial localization, enabling spatially&#8208;restricted imaging of two types of cancer&#8208;related mitomiRs with improved detection accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate imaging of mitomiRs in vivo through spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled delivery and activation. Therefore, this study illustrates a simple methodology that may be broadly applicable for investigating the mitomiRs&#8208;associated physiological events.

         <title>Electrochromic Polycationic Organoboronium Macrocycles with Multiple Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17942-17946, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycationic organoboronium macrocycles comprising four bipyridylboronium units in a cyclic conjugated framework are introduced, with the boron cations linked by fluorene and two electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or two electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that multiple redox states can be reversibly accessed with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons and switchable electrochromic properties are realized.







Abstract
Polycationic macrocycles are attractive as they display unique molecular switching capabilities arising from their redox properties. Although diverse polycationic macrocycles have been developed, those based on cationic boron systems remain very limited. We present herein the development of novel polycationic macrocycles by introducing organoboronium moieties into a conjugated organoboron macrocyclic framework. These macrocycles consist of four bipyridylboronium units that are connected by fluorene and either electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Electrochemical studies reveal that the macrocycles undergo reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons. Switchable electrochromic behavior is demonstrated via spectroelectrochemical studies and the observed color changes are rationalized by correlation with computed electronic transitions using DFT methods.

We present herein the development of novel polycationic macrocycles by introducing organoboronium moieties into a conjugated organoboron macrocyclic framework. These macrocycles consist of four bipyridylboronium units that are connected by fluorene and either electron-deficient arylborane or electron-rich arylamine moieties. Electrochemical studies reveal that the macrocycles undergo reversible multi-step redox processes with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons. Switchable electrochromic behavior is demonstrated via spectroelectrochemical studies and the observed color changes are rationalized by correlation with computed electronic transitions using DFT methods.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Photodetachment of Amino Acid Anions</title>

Electrospraying allows bringing &#8220;molecular elephants&#8221; into the gas phase, as phrased by J.&#8197;B. Fenn, where subsequent chirality analysis&#8212;in the current example via photoelectron circular dichroism resulting from photodetachment from anions&#8212;reveals the chirality of enantiomers present.







Abstract
The chirality of chemical compounds is of undisputed importance in science and technology. In particular with respect to pharmacological application most molecules of interest cannot be accessed by the powerful techniques developed in recent years for gas phase analytes. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) with the detection of photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) provides access to chirality information applicable to molecular materials with negligible vapor pressure, for example, amino acids. To this end, glutamic acid and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) have been electrosprayed into the source of a chirality spectrometer, where photodetachment is enforced and the PECD is detected. The technique can be expected to be conceptually applicable to all chemical systems with chirality based on molecular properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Azaylide&#8208;Based Amphiphiles by the Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17915-17919, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction is reported. These azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles are stable against hydrolysis even in water and form ca. 2&#8197;nm spherical aggregates through self&#8208;assembly. Furthermore, the obtained amphiphiles are capable of encapsulation of hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free reactions are powerful tools creating various functional molecules and materials. However, such chemical bonds are usually hydrolysable or require specific functional groups, which limits their use in aqueous media. Herein, we report the development of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction. Simple mixing of chlorinated aryl azide with a hydrophilic moiety and various triarylphosphines (PAr3) gave rise to azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles NPAr3, rapidly and quantitatively. The obtained NPAr3 formed ca. 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water. The hydrolysis of NPAr3 was significantly suppressed as compared with those of non&#8208;chlorinated amphiphiles nNPAr3. Computational studies revealed that the stability is mainly governed by the decrease in LUMO around the phosphorus atom owing to the o&#8208;substituted halogen groups. Furthermore, hydrophobic dyes such as Nile red and BODIPY were encapsulated by the spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water.

         <title>The Enantioselective Synthesis of Eburnamonine, Eucophylline, and 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;Leucophyllidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17957-17962, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;convergent&#8211;divergent&#8221; strategy was used to synthesize the dimeric natural product leucophyllidine. An enantioenriched lactam building block was advanced in a divergent fashion to complete syntheses of both eburnamonine and eucophylline in 10 and 16 steps, respectively. A convergent cross&#8208;coupling and hydrogenation sequence was then employed to afford 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;leucophyllidine (see scheme).







Abstract
A synthetic approach to the heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid leucophyllidine is disclosed herein. An enantioenriched lactam building block, synthesized through palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation, served as the precursor to both hemispheres. The eburnamonine&#8208;derived fragment was synthesized through a Bischler&#8211;Napieralski/hydrogenation approach, while the eucophylline&#8208;derived fragment was synthesized by Friedl&#228;nder quinoline synthesis and two sequential C&#8722;H functionalization steps. A convergent Stille coupling and phenol&#8208;directed hydrogenation united the two monomeric fragments to afford 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;leucophyllidine in 21 steps from commercial material.

         <title>Chiral Induction in Buckminsterfullerene Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17947-17951, August 9, 2021. </description>

Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is one of the most symmetrical molecules. Nanoconfinement of C60 within a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is able to perturb the inherent symmetry of C60 via the host&#8211;guest interactions. As a consequence, C60 confined in the MOF exhibited unprecedented substantial chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Chiral induction is an emerging topic of interest in various areas of chemistry because of its relationship to the elusive mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) with the shape of a highly symmetric truncated icosahedron has rarely been referred for chiral induction due to the difficult symmetry breaking. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can provide a key field for chiral induction. C60 could be incorporated into the chiral nanochannels of the MOF using an in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy. The circular dichroism spectra of the resulting nanocomposites showed an intense chiral signal in the absorption region of C60. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that this unprecedented chiral induction of C60 was attributed to hybridization of the molecular orbitals through a close association with the pore surface of the MOF. Our method can endow highly symmetric achiral compounds with chirality, paving the new way toward fabrication of novel chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulfate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17866-17870, August 9, 2021. </description>

The reaction of AgF with SOF4 in MeCN solution gives rise to solvated AgOSF5, which defines the starting point for a variety of other SF5O compounds. For example, transition metal salts are accessible by metathesis; furthermore, bipyridine&#8208;stabilised AgOSF5 has proven its general utility in the preparation of SF5O&#8208;substituted aromatics. The solid&#8208;state structure of the distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anion has been revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Herein, we report the preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulfate from commercially available AgF and OSF4. The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5 has been stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5 complexes with NiII, CuI, and CuII&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5 has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5 groups to aryne moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5&#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition&#8208;metal OSF5 compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.

     alt="A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulfate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5 Compounds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of AgF with SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in MeCN solution gives rise to solvated AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which defines the starting point for a variety of other SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O compounds. For example, transition metal salts are accessible by metathesis; furthermore, bipyridine-stabilised AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has proven its general utility in the preparation of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O-substituted aromatics. The solid-state structure of the distorted octahedral [OSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion has been revealed by X-ray crystallography.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulfate from commercially available AgF and OSF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN solution. Apart from that, AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has been stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; complexes with Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; groups to aryne moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted arenes. X-ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition-metal OSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoinduced Reversible Semicrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous State Transitions of Stereoregular Azopolyesters</title>

The rapid and reversible transition in aggregation structure of stereoregular azopolyesters between the semicrystalline and amorphous states can be easily manipulated via the reversible cis&#8211;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moieties in the side chains.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of isotactic azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) with main&#8208;chain chirality via highly enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic azobenzene&#8208;containing epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. All polyesters with trans&#8208;azobenzene moieties were found to be semicrystalline materials with melting temperatures of 153&#8211;231&#8201;&#176;C, while the corresponding isotactic cis&#8208;azopolyesters were amorphous. The azobenzene groups in the copolymers exhibited reversible trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis and cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans photoisomerization upon irradiation with light. This demonstrates that the crystallinity of isotactic azopolyesters can be manipulated via photoinduced reversible isomerization. In addition, mixing isotactic trans&#8208;polyesters with different enantiomeric configurations in a 1:1 mass ratio afforded crystalline stereocomplexes for which the crystalline behavior differed significantly from those of the component enantiomer. Also, photoinduced reversible transitions between semicrystalline and amorphous states were observed in various stereocomplexes of isotactic trans&#8208;azopolyesters, similar to the isotactic azopolyesters themselves.

         <title>Influence of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticle Sizes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries**

Particle&#8208;size reduction of iron sulfide nanoparticles improves its performance as an active material in solid&#8208;state conversion cathodes: For reduced particle dimensions, the electrochemical utilization of FeS2 is increased. The potential of FeS2 as an electrode in solid&#8208;state batteries is highlighted and the importance of the morphological design of battery materials is underscored.







Abstract
Given the inherent performance limitations of intercalation&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state conversion batteries are promising systems for future energy storage. A high specific capacity and natural abundancy make iron disulfide (FeS2) a promising cathode&#8208;active material. In this work, FeS2 nanoparticles were prepared solvothermally. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, samples with average particle diameters between 10&#8197;nm and 35&#8197;nm were synthesized. The electrochemical performance was evaluated in solid&#8208;state cells with a Li&#8208;argyrodite solid electrolyte. While the reduction of FeS2 was found to be irreversible in the initial discharge, a stable cycling of the reduced species was observed subsequently. A positive effect of smaller particle dimensions on FeS2 utilization was identified, which can be attributed to a higher interfacial contact area and shortened diffusion pathways inside the FeS2 particles. These results highlight the general importance of morphological design to exploit the promising theoretical capacity of conversion electrodes in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iodine(III) Reagents for the Lipophilization of Peptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17963-17968, August 9, 2021. </description>

Amphiphilic hypervalent iodine reagents enable the alkynylation of cysteine residues in peptides with lipophilic groups in water. The reaction proceeds in neutral standard buffers with high efficiency for a broad range of peptides and one protein. The thioalkynes can be converted into cleavable thioesters under acidic conditions.







Abstract
We report the functionalization of cysteine residues with lipophilic alkynes bearing a silyl group or an alkyl chain using amphiphilic ethynylbenziodoxolone reagents (EBXs). The reactions were carried out in buffer (pH&#8197;6 to 9), without organic co&#8208;solvent or removal of oxygen, either at 37&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature. The transformation led to a significant increase of peptide lipophilicity and worked for aromatic thiols, homocysteine, cysteine, and peptides containing 4 to 18 amino acids. His6&#8208;Cys&#8208;Ubiquitin was also alkynylated under physiological conditions. Under acidic conditions, the thioalkynes were converted into thioesters, which could be cleaved in the presence of hydroxylamine.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot and Shape&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17904-17909, August 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages is presented. They can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogues that exhibit great potential for further modification. The [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane.







Abstract
Organic cages are fascinating because of their well&#8208;defined 3D cavities, excellent stability, and accessible post&#8208;modification. However, the synthesis is normally realized by fragment coupling approach in low yields. Herein, we report one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages (box&#8208;shaped [4]cage and triangular prism&#8208;shaped [2]cage) in yields of 46&#8201;% and 52&#8201;%, involving direct condensation of triangular 1,3,5&#8208;tris(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)benzene monomer with paraformaldehyde and isobutyraldehyde, respectively. The cages can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogues. The [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane. By changing the central moiety of the triangular monomer and/or aldehyde, this synthetic method would have the potential to be a general strategy to access diverse cages with tunable shape, size, and electronic properties.

         <title>Tailoring the Microporosity of Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Advanced Gas Separation by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>

Excellent gas separation performance and suitable stability and mechanical properties are simultaneously obtained via Al2O3 atomic layer deposition on PIM&#8208;1 membranes owing to the strong molecular sieving effect induced by Al2O3 deposition that tailors the polymer microporosity.







Abstract
Tailoring the microporosity of intrinsically microporous polymers at the atomic level is one of the biggest challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes. In this study, for the first time, the Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used to modify the microporosity of a typical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1) at the atomic level. PIM&#8208;1 with six ALD cycles (PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure&#8208; and mixed&#8208;gas separation, and anti&#8208;aging properties. The O2/N2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation performances were adequate above the latest trade&#8208;off lines. PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6 showed CO2 and O2 permeabilities of 624 and 188&#8197;Barrer, combined with CO2/CH4 and O2/N2 selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively. This significantly enhanced performance was attributed to the strong size sieving effect induced by the Al2O3 deposition.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interactions in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Isoreticular Series for Molecular Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17854-17860, August 9, 2021. </description>

The search for more efficient and stable catalysts often yields hybrid host&#8211;guest systems. This work rationally engineered a series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks as hosts and selectively positioned guests, a CO2 reduction catalyst and a photosensitizer, on the surface or inside the pores for photocatalytic solar fuel production. The results help understand host&#8211;guest interactions and provide transferrable criteria for material design.







Abstract
A strategy to improve homogeneous molecular catalyst stability, efficiency, and selectivity is the immobilization on supporting surfaces or within host matrices. Herein, we examine the co&#8208;immobilization of a CO2 reduction catalyst [ReBr(CO)3(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)] and a photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(5,5&#8242;&#8208;dcbpy)]Cl2 using the isoreticular series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO&#8208;66, &#8208;67, and &#8208;68. Specific host pore size choice enables distinct catalyst and photosensitizer spatial location&#8212;either at the outer MOF particle surface or inside the MOF cavities&#8212;affecting catalyst stability, electronic communication between reaction center and photosensitizer, and consequently the apparent catalytic rates. These results allow for a rational understanding of an optimized supramolecular layout of catalyst, photosensitizer, and host matrix.

         <title>Chemical Characterization of a Volatile Dubnium Compound, DbOCl3</title>

Dubnium obeys Mendeleev's periodicity. Fifty years after the discovery of this element, its chemical behavior was experimentally revisited. From the gas chromatographic investigation of the volatile oxychloride compound, a trend of decreasing volatility along Group&#8197;5 elements was deduced, in agreement with the expectations by the laws established in the Periodic Table.







Abstract
The formation and the chemical characterization of single atoms of dubnium (Db, element 105), in the form of its volatile oxychloride, was investigated using the on&#8208;line gas phase chromatography technique, in the temperature range 350&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C. Under the exactly same chemical conditions, comparative studies with the lighter homologues of Group&#8197;5 in the Periodic Table clearly indicate the volatility sequence being NbOCl3 &gt; TaOCl3 &#8805; DbOCl3. From the obtained experimental results, thermochemical data for DbOCl3 were derived. The present study delivers reliable experimental information for theoretical calculations on chemical properties of transactinides.

         <title>Total Structure of Bimetallic Core&#8211;Shell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; Nanocluster and Its Implications</title>

A bimetallic core&#8211;shell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; nanocluster is synthesized and its structure is determined. The metal core possesses a Au42 core encaged by a shell of 40 cadmium atoms, which is protected by 52 thiolate ligands. The elucidation of this gold core/cadmium shell nanostructure expands the types of hetero&#8208;structured nanoclusters and promotes the understanding of bimetallic metal&#8208;metal bonding and interactions at the atomic level.







Abstract
Bimetallic core&#8211;shell nanostructures hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism. However, it remains a challenge to construct atomically precise core&#8211;shell with high&#8208;valence active metals on the gold surface. In this work, we report the total structure of a [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8722; core&#8211;shell nanocluster and multiple implications. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) reveals that the structure possesses a two&#8208;shelled Au6@Au36 core and a closed cadmium shell of Cd40, and the core&#8211;shell structure is then protected by 52 thiolate (&#8208;SR) ligands. The composition of the nanocluster is further confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). A catalytic test for styrene oxidation and a comparison with relevant nanoclusters reveal the surface effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of Aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones</title>

We developed a single&#8208;electron approach for the construction of aliphatic ketones from activated carboxylic acids using merged NHC/photoredox catalysis. Computational studies and mechanistic analysis revealed that reactivity is dependent on both the substrate and NHC catalyst. This methodology was showcased in the direct functionalization of amino acids and bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8722;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the light&#8208;driven synthesis of aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones using single&#8208;electron NHC operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate&#8208;dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst potential is harnessed in the visible&#8208;light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of single&#8208;electron NHC operators.

&lt;p&gt;Single-electron N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8722;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the light-driven synthesis of aliphatic and &#945;-amino ketones using single-electron NHC operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate-dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst potential is harnessed in the visible-light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late-stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of single-electron NHC operators.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hypsochromic Shift of Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence by Oxygen Atom Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 33, Page 17910-17914, August 9, 2021. </description>

A multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material that comprised oxygen, nitrogen, and boron atoms (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) was synthesized via one&#8208;shot double borylation. An OLED device employing the fabricated &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me exhibits deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Herein, we reported an ultrapure blue multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield and a large rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing. Because of restricted &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the HOMO rather than the LUMO induced by oxygen atom incorporation, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me shows a hypsochromic shift compared to the parent MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA). An organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on this material exhibits an emission at 465&#8197;nm, with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.10), and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.5&#8201;%. Moreover, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me facilitates a drastically improved efficiency roll&#8208;off and a device lifetime compared to &#957;&#8208;DABNA, which demonstrates significant potential of the oxygen atom incorporation strategy.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Unlocks a 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D Switch in MOF Breathing Response: A Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Diffraction Mapping Study</title>

Post&#8208;synthetic modification of diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;61 generates its methylamide analogue [(Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NH(CO)Me)], SHF&#8208;62, as single crystals. Resulting ligand steric demands and H&#8208;bonding capability lead to a change in dimensionality of the MOF breathing behaviour from 2D breathing (pore width) to 3D breathing (pore width and length), which has been mapped by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of the interpenetrated diamondoid metal&#8211;organic framework (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NH2)2] (BDC&#8208;NH2=aminobenzenedicarboxylate) SHF&#8208;61 proceeds quantitatively in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner to yield the acetamide derivative (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] SHF&#8208;62. Continuous breathing behaviour during activation/desolvation is retained upon PSM, but pore closing now leads to ring&#8208;flipping to avert steric clash of amide methyl groups of the modified ligands. This triggers a reduction in the amplitude of the breathing deformation in the two dimensions associated with pore diameter, but a large increase in the third dimension associated with pore length. The MOF is thereby converted from predominantly 2D breathing (in SHF&#8208;61) to a distinctly 3D breathing motion (in SHF&#8208;62) indicating a decoupling of the pore&#8208;width and pore&#8208;length breathing motions. These breathing motions have been mapped by a series of single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl halides.&#160;However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to&#160;purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi&#8208;step transformations.&#160;Here we introduce base&#8208;activated, latent sulfinate reagents;&#160;&#946;&#8208;nitrile and &#946;&#8208;ester sulfones. We show that under the cross&#8208;coupling conditions, these species eliminate to generate the sulfinate salt&#160;in situ, which then undergoes efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi&#8208;step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale&#8208;up.</dc:description>

         <title>Radically Enhanced Dual Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexation between a viologen radical cation (  V  &#8226;+  ) and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylene) diradical dication (  CBPQT  2(&#8226;+)  ) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of two  V  &#8226;+  &#160;using radical&#8208;pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (  MV  &#8226;+  ) in a size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host&#8212;namely, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalene)  2(&#8226;+)  , i.e.,  CBPQN  2(&#8226;+)  . Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cationic units&#160;in  CBPQN  2(&#8226;+)  suitable for binding two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;with relatively short (3.05&#8211;3.25 &#197;) radical&#8208;pairing distances. The radical host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association&#160;with the two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex&#8212;namely, [  (MV)  2  &#8834;  CBPQN]  4(&#8226;+  )  &#8212;in MeCN was confirmed by VT&#160;  1  H NMR, as well as by EPR, spectroscopy. The solid&#8208;state superstructure of [  (MV)  2  &#8834;  CBPQN]  4(&#8226;+  )  reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05 &#197;) between the three different  V  &#8226;+  , suggesting that localization of the radical&#8208;pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two  MV  &#8226;+  &#160;inside the radical host.&#160;Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host&#8208;guest radical&#8208;pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox&#8208;switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol&#8208; and Phenyl&#8208;Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyphenol&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has attracted interest for engineering a range of functional surface coatings. Herein, we report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412 kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional &#8226;OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives (from small molecules to biological macromolecules containing phenol groups) and different metal ions including Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), and Co(II). In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. Importantly, the properties (e.g., radical scavenging and antibacterial activity) of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for the surface engineering of diverse materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+  chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).</dc:description>

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na  2  WO  4  /SiO  2  catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of  in&#8208;situ  Raman and chemical probe (H  2  &#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na  2  WO  4  active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable dispersed surface Na&#8208;WO  x  sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (  i  ) surface Na&#8208;WO  x  sites are responsible for selectively activating CH  4  to C  2  H  x  and over&#8208;oxidizing CH  y  to CO and (  ii  ) molten Na  2  WO  4  phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH  4  to CO  2  and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C  2  H  6  to C  2  H  4  . These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na  2  WO  4  /SiO  2  catalysts.</dc:description>

A library of lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures are acquired through a stepwise epitaxial growth procedure, from which rational modulation of each domain with specific lanthanide doping species allows for definition of photonic barcodes in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) domain with remarkably enlarged encoding capacity.

         <title>Chemoselective and highly sensitive quantification of gut microbiome and human metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host&#8217;s physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging.&#160;Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at&#160;femto&#8208; and attomole quantities, and detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics&#8208;driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our Chemical Biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.</dc:description>

         <title>Hard X&#8208;ray Nanotomography for 3D Analysis of Coking in Nickel&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding catalyst deactivation by coking is crucial for knowledge&#8208;based catalyst and process design in reactions with carbonaceous species. Post&#8208;mortem analysis of catalyst coking is often performed by bulk characterization methods. Here hard X&#8208;ray ptychographic computed tomography (PXCT) was used to study Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation and CH4 dry reforming after artificial coking treatment. PXCT generated quantitative 3D maps of local electron density at ca. 80 nm resolution, allowing to visualize and evaluate the severity of coking in entire catalyst particles of ca. 40 &#181;m diameter. Coking was&#160;primarily revealed in the nanoporous solid, which was not detectable in resolved macropores. Coke formation was independently confirmed by operando Raman spectroscopy. PXCT is highlighted as an emerging characterization tool for nanoscale identification, co&#8208;localization, and potentially quantification of deactivation phenomena in 3D space within entire catalyst particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies to avoid artifacts in mass spectrometry&#8208;based epitranscriptome analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, we perform structure validation of recently reported RNA phosphorothioate (PT) modifications, a new set of epitranscriptome marks found in bacteria and eukaryotes including humans. By comparing synthetic PT&#8208;containing diribonucleotides with native species in RNA hydrolysates by high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), metabolic stable isotope labeling, and PT&#8208;specific iodine&#8208;desulfurization, we disprove the existence of PTs in RNA from  E.  &#160;  coli  ,  S. cerevisiae  , human cell lines, and mouse brain. Furthermore, we discuss how an MS artifact led to the initial misidentification of 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated diribonucleotides as RNA phosphorothioates. To aid structure validation, we present a detailed guideline for MS analysis of RNA hydrolysates, emphasizing how the chosen RNA hydrolysis protocol can be a decisive factor in discovering and quantifying RNA modifications in biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>The voltage dependent sidedness of the reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base determines the unique inward pumping of Xenorhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The new class of microbial rhodopsins, called xenorhodopsins (XeRs) (1), extends the versatility of this family by inward H  +  pumps (2&#8211;4). These pumps are an alternative optogenetic tool to the light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. ChR1,2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. In this work we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (  Ns  XeR) (1). The photodynamic behavior of  Ns  XeR was investigated on the ps to s time scale elucidating the formation of the J and K and a previously unknown long&#8208;lived intermediate. The pH dependent kinetics reveal that alkalization of the surrounding medium accelerates the photocycle and the pump turnover. In patch&#8208;clamp experiments the blue&#8208;light illumination of  Ns  XeR in the M state shows a potential&#8208;dependent vectoriality of the photocurrent transients, suggesting a variable accessibility of reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base. Insights on the kinetically independent switching mechanism could furthermore be obtained by mutational studies on the putative intracellular H  +  acceptor D220.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrosynthetic Hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carboxylation of low value commodity chemicals to&#160;provide higher value carboxylic acids is of significant interest.&#160;Recently alternative routes to the traditional hydroformylation&#160;processes that used potentially toxic carbon monoxide and a&#160;transition metal catalyst have appeared. A significant challenge has&#160;been the selectivity observed for olefin carboxylation. Photochemical&#160;methods have shown a viable route towards the hydrocarboxylation&#160;of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes but rely on the use of an excess sulfur or&#160;amine reagent. Herein we report our investigations of an&#160;electrochemical approach that is able to hydrocarboxylate a,bunsaturated&#160;alkenes with excellent regioselectivity and the ability to&#160;carboxylate hindered substrates to afford &#945;&#8208;quaternary centre&#160;carboxylic acids. The reported process requires no chromatography&#160;and the products are purified by simple crystallisation from the&#160;reaction mixture after work up.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Patterned and Multilayer Thin Films for Organic Electronics via Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant SI&#8208;PET&#8208;RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is used to create the multilayer architectures of 3rd&#8208; and 4th&#8208;generation OLEDs using photoinduced electron transfer reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization. Direct photomasking and digital projection lithography allow for complex patterning at low cost.







Abstract
An oxygen&#8208;tolerant approach is described for preparing surface&#8208;tethered polymer films of organic semiconductors directly from electrode substrates using polymer brush photolithography. A photoinduced electron transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) approach was used to prepare multiblock polymer architectures with the structures of multi&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including electron&#8208;transport, emissive, and hole&#8208;transport layers. The preparation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and thermally assisted fluorescence (TAF) trilayer OLED architectures are described. By using direct photomasking as well as a digital micromirror device, we also show that the surface&#8208;initiated (SI)&#8208;PET&#8208;RAFT approach allows for enhanced control over layer thickness, and spatial resolution in polymer brush patterning at low cost.

         <title>Continuous Flow Z&#8208;Stereoselective Olefin Metathesis: Development and Applications in the Synthesis of Pheromones and Macrocyclic Odorant Molecules**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow Z&#8208;stereoselective olefin metathesis was described with a set of Z&#8208;stereoselective Ru&#8208;catalysts. Good productivity and excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) were obtained in the formation of various internal olefins including highly desirable pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules. A telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors was also reported.







Abstract
The first continuous flow Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis process is reported. Key to realizing this process was the adequate choice of stereoselective catalysts combined with the design of an appropriate continuous reactor setup. The designed continuous process permits various self&#8208;, cross&#8208; and macro&#8208;ring&#8208;closing&#8208;metathesis reactions, delivering products in high selectivity and short residence times. This technique is exemplified by direct application to the preparation of a range of pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules and culminates in a telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/ Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors.

         <title>Hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3]: Optimizing the Optical Anisotropy with Heteroanionic Units for Deep Ultraviolet Birefringent Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
The first sodium hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a new deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], are optimally aligned to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with O&#8722;H bonds, which makes Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] have a large birefringence and band gap.







Abstract
Maximizing the optical anisotropy in birefringent materials has emerged as an efficient route for modulating the polarization&#8208;dependent light propagation. Currently, the generation of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) polarized light below 200&#8197;nm is essential but challenging due to the interdisciplinary significance and insufficiency of high&#8208;performing birefringent crystals. Herein, by introducing multiple heteroanionic units, the first sodium difluorodihydroxytriborate&#8208;boric acid Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a novel deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], optimally align to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with hydrogens, which results in an extremely large birefringence and band gap. The well&#8208;ordered OH/F anions in [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3] were identified and confirmed by various approaches, and also the origin of large birefringence was theoretically discussed. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing hydrogen involved heteroanionic units to design crystals with large birefringence, and also expand the alternative system of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals with new hydroxyfluorooxoborates.

         <title>Plasma Tuning Local Environment of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasma (N2, O2, H2, Ar) regulated h&#8208;BN with distinct local environment were obtained and employed for ODH of propane: N2 treated BN containing more three&#8208;boron center nitrogen&#8208;defects exhibited remarkable propane conversion of 26.0&#8201;% with olefin selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% at 520&#8201;&#176;C. O2 treated BN showed deactivation due to the sintering effect of &#8220;BOx&#8221;. N&#8208;H and B&#8208;H generated during H2 treatment, may be unable to facilitate the reaction activity.







Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides. However, high crystallinity of commercial h&#8208;BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency. Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h&#8208;BN. N2&#8208;treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0&#8201;% propane conversion with 89.4&#8201;% selectivity toward olefins at 520&#8201;&#176;C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that &#8220;three&#8208;boron center&#8221; N&#8208;defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. While the sintering effect of the &#8220;BOx&#8221; species in O2&#8208;treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4&#8201;% conversion at 520&#8201;&#176;C).

3D single&#8208;particle&#8208;tracking microscopy combined with a lock&#8208;in filtering algorithm for the quantitative observation of individual protein&#8211;nanoparticle (NP) interactions without surface immobilization is presented. This highly sensitive method, which can be applied in various protein&#8211;NP systems, gives insight into in&#8197;situ protein corona on a per&#8208;particle basis and provides the possibility to study transient protein&#8211;NP interactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when exposed to biological fluids, forming a dynamic protein corona that affects their fate in biological environments. A comprehensive understanding of the protein corona is lacking due to the inability of current techniques to precisely measure the full corona in&#8197;situ at the single&#8208;particle level. Herein, we introduce a 3D real&#8208;time single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy to &#8220;lock&#8208;on&#8221; to single freely diffusing polystyrene NPs and probe their individual protein coronas, primarily using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model system. The fluorescence signals and diffusive motions of the tracked NPs enable quantification of the &#8220;hard corona&#8221; using mean&#8208;squared displacement analysis. Critically, this method's particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle nature enabled a lock&#8208;in&#8208;type frequency filtering approach to extract the full protein corona, despite the typically confounding effect of high background signal from unbound proteins. From these results, the dynamic in&#8197;situ full protein corona is observed to contain twice the number of proteins compared to the ex&#8197;situ&#8208;measured &#8220;hard&#8221; protein corona.

         <title>Beyond Takai's Olefination Reagent: Persistent Dehalogenation Emerges in a Chromium(III)&#8208;&#956;3&#8208;Methylidyne Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methylidyne complex [CrIII3Cl3(&#956;&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] displays the ultimate product of the CrCl2/CHI3 redox reaction, significantly affecting carbonylic group transformation; the trimetallic compound also exhibits unusual magnetic behavior and provides ready access to half&#8208;sandwich clusters.







Abstract
Reaction of CHI3 with six equivalents of CrCl2 in THF at low temperatures affords [Cr3Cl3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] as the first isolable high&#8208;yield CrIII &#956;3&#8208;methylidyne complex. Substitution of the terminal chlorido ligands via salt metathesis with alkali&#8208;metal cyclopentadienides generates isostructural half&#8208;sandwich chromium(III)&#8208;&#956;3&#8208;methylidynes [CpR3Cr3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)] (CpR=C5H5, C5Me5, C5H4SiMe3). Side and decomposition products of the Cl/CpR exchange reactions were identified and structurally characterized for [Cr4(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)4(&#956;2&#8208;I)2(&#956;4&#8208;O)(thf)4] and [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4SiMe3)CrCl(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)2Li(thf)2]. The Cl/CpR exchange drastically changed the ambient&#8208;temperature effective magnetic moment &#956;eff from 9.30/9.11&#8197;&#956;B (solution/solid) to 3.63/4.32&#8197;&#956;B (CpR=C5Me5). Reactions of [Cr3Cl3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] with aldehydes and ketones produce intricate mixtures of species through oxy/methylidyne exchange, which were partially identified as radical recombination products through GC/MS analysis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Few&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell MFI Zeolite Synthesized using a Simple Di&#8208;quaternary Ammonium Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium cation was used as structure&#8208;directing agent to prepare few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell (ca. 10&#8197;nm) MFI type zeolite catalysts and adsorbents with a wide range of composition (pure silica, aluminosilicate and stannosilicate). The SDA design was selected based on simple heuristic arguments regarding contributions of its structural elements to early crystal growth characteristics of MFI.







Abstract
Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines butyl ammonium, in place of the one commonly used for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m. Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of TMSB molecules are found to effectively optimize SEI via EDL structure regulation. It is their preferable adsorption on the Li&#8208;metal surface and their attraction to PF6&#8722; ions result in a high&#8208;local ion concentration in the EDL region, thus forming an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and demonstrating superior performance.







Abstract
Despite high specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94&#8201;%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5&#8197;Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 90.90&#8201;% capacity retention over 50 cycles.

         <title>Enantioselective Addition of Pyrazoles to Dienes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective addition of pyrazoles to 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported. Secondary and tertiary allylic pyrazoles can be generated with excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first enantioselective addition of pyrazoles to 1,3&#8208;dienes. Secondary and tertiary allylic pyrazoles can be generated with excellent regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies support a pathway distinct from previous hydroaminations: a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT). This hydroamination tolerates a range of functional groups and advances the field of diene hydrofunctionalization.

         <title>Skeletal Editing&#8212;Nitrogen Deletion of Secondary Amines by Anomeric Amide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for structural modification by skeletal editing of secondary amines employs N&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkoxyamide as a reagent. Single&#8208;atom N&#8208;deletion is a novel approach for constructing C&#8722;C bonds under N2 extrusion and uses widely available secondary amines in late&#8208;stage skeletal modification enabling ring contraction and structure optimization of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage modification is highly desirable for the diversification and modification of biologically active compounds. Peripheral editing (e.g., C&#8722;H activation) has been the predominant methodology, whereas skeletal editing is in its infancy. The single&#8208;atom N&#8208;deletion using anomeric amide reagents constitutes a powerful tool to modify the underlying molecular skeletons of secondary amines. N&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkoxyamide is easily prepared on a large scale and promotes C&#8722;C bond formation in good yields under the extrusion of N2 for a variety of (cyclic) aliphatic amines. The exploitation of widely available amines allows the use of existing amine synthesis protocols to translate into the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds, enabling ring contraction and the potential for structure optimization of biologically active compounds.

         <dc:description>Given the limitation inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attentions have focused on the potential successor of Li&#8208;ion batteries such as Lithium Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and Lithium oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic Lithium as anode is essential. Nevertheless, the growth of Li dendrites accompanied with severe safety hazards hinder the practical application of Li metal anode. Another obstacle that hinders the practical application of Li metal anode is the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles, which causes inevitable active Li loss. Hence, a large amount of inventory metallic Li is needed to prolong the cycle life of Li metal batteries. However, largely excessive Li in the anode is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li metal batteries. For Li metal batteries under practical conditions, low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) accompanied with high&#8208;voltage cathode is perquisite. In this reviews, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolyte for practical Li metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolyte for practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic FePt@PtBi Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. One effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Here, we demonstrate a general surface&#8208;engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating chemically ordered intermetallic phases with alloy&#160;PtBi shells. FePt@PtBi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles&#160;showed the best ORR performance with a mass activity of 0.96 A mg  Pt  &#8211;1  and a specific activity of 2.06 mA cm  &#8211;2  , respectively 7 times and 11 times those of the corresponding values for benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows much better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than conventional Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The observed comprehensive enhancement in ORR performance of FePt@PtBi can be attributed to the increased compressive strain of the Pt surface due to in&#8208;plane shearing resulting from the presence of the large Bi atoms in the surface&#8208;structured PtBi overlayers, as well as charge displacement via Pt&#8722;Bi bonding which mitigates crossover issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Co Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we reported a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance shows better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015 e s  &#8211;1  site  &#8211;1  ). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Enantiopure Pyrrolidines by C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8211;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8211;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) from a&#160;  N  &#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free&#160;  NH&#8208;  derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Here, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovers the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral distorted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes bearing a nonagon&#8208;embedded carbohelicene.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 4.2 &#215; 10&#8211;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and characterization of spike N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamers for rapid SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&lt; 80 nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo&#8208;EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N&#8208;terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 at concentrations as low as 10  6  copies/mL. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing ammonia quantification minefield in photo/electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis&#8212;a low&#8208;carbon and sustainable process has developed fast over the past decade while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH  3  brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH  3  synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. By regulating the parameters of detection methods, the experimental detection limitation can be expanded from 0.2 ppm to 0.1 ppm, even lower. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ion Binding Mediates the Reversible Interconversion of Cis and Trans Peroxido Dicopper Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium&#8208;ion binding mediates the reversible interconversion of the prototypical trans&#8208;peroxido Cu2O2 core (TP) to the rare and biologically relevant cis&#8208;peroxido Cu2O2 core (CP). This provides new opportunities to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O2 activation in biomimetic systems.







Abstract
Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu2O2) featured in type III copper proteins (hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O2 transport and substrate oxidation in many organisms. &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis peroxido dicopper cores (CP) have been proposed as key structures in the early stages of O2 binding in these proteins; their reversible isomerization to other Cu2O2 cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic CP cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of CP Cu2O2 species remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report the reversible interconversion of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans peroxido (TP) and CP dicopper cores. CaII mediates this process by reversible binding at the Cu2O2 core, highlighting the unique capability for metal&#8208;ion binding events to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O2 activation in biomimetic systems.

         <title>Supramolecular Bioimaging through Signal Amplification by Combining Indicator Displacement Assay with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel supramolecular strategy for fluorescence imaging via incorporation of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into indicator displacement assay.







Abstract
Fluorescent chemosensors are powerful imaging tools in the fields of life sciences and engineering. Based on the principle of supramolecular chemistry, indicator displacement assay (IDA) provides an alternative approach for constructing and optimizing chemosensors, which has the advantages of simplicity, tunability, and modularity. However, the application of IDA in bioimaging continues to face a series of challenges, including interfering signals, background noise, and inconsistent spatial location. Accordingly, we herein report a supramolecular bioimaging strategy of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;assisted IDA by employing macrocyclic amphiphiles as the operating platform. By merging FRET with IDA, the limitations of IDA in bioimaging were addressed. As a proof of concept, the study achieved mitochondria&#8208;targeted imaging of adenosine triphosphate in live cells with signal amplification. This study opens a non&#8208;covalent avenue for bioimaging with advancements in tunability, generality, and simplicity, apart from the covalent approach.

         <title>&#8220;Repaired and Activated&#8221; DNAzyme Enables the Monitoring of DNA Alkylation Repair in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report &#8220;repaired and activated&#8221; DNAzymes (RADzymes) as a simple and versatile platform for the measurement of multiple DNA alkylation repair in living cells. The catalytic activity of RADzymes was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair, thus providing a useful strategy for the study of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.







Abstract
Direct measurement of DNA repair is critical for the annotation of their clinical relevance and the discovery of drugs for cancer therapy. Here we reported a &#8220;repaired and activated&#8221; DNAzyme (RADzyme) by incorporating a single methyl lesion (O6MeG, 3MeC, or 1MeA) at designated positions through systematic screening. We found that the catalytic activity of the RADzyme was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair. Benefit from these findings, a fluorogenic RADzyme sensor was developed for the monitoring of MGMT&#8208;mediated repair of O6MeG lesion. Importantly, the sensor allowed the evaluation of MGMT repair activity in different cells and under drugs treatment. Furthermore, another RADzyme sensor was engineered for the monitoring of ALKBH2&#8208;mediated repair of 3MeC lesion. This strategy provides a simple and versatile tool for the study of the basic biology of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure CO electroreduction at silver produces ethanol and propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing CO  2  to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO  2  , copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products &#8211; making the CO  2  electrochemistry of silver very similar to copper at sufficiently high coverage.</dc:description>

The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp  3  )&#8210;C(sp  2  ) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8208;48 hours to only 5&#8208;15 minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide&#8208;Modifying Radical SAM Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report biochemical study of a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP). This rSAM enzyme exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity, which produces cyclophane in vivo but formylglycine and aminomalonate (Ama) in vitro. Unlike most enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis, this enzyme does not require leader peptide for activity.







Abstract
Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three&#8208;residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3&#8208;CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatic study revealed that 3&#8208;CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence. Our work discloses the first ribosomal path towards Ama formation, providing a possible hint for the rich occurrence of Ama in Nature.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Synthetic Growth Factor Surrogates with Fine&#8208;Tuned Agonism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists that elicit a desired signal activity is reported. Synthetic growth factor surrogates showing fine&#8208;tuned agonism were developed by exploiting the programmability of DNA aptamer. These DNA&#8208;based agonists can be used to regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting moderate receptor signaling.







Abstract
Designing synthetic surrogates of functional proteins is an important, albeit challenging, task in the field of chemistry. A strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists for growth factor or cytokine receptors that elicit a desired signal activity has been in high demand, as such ligands hold great promise as safer and more effective therapeutics. In the present study, we used a DNA aptamer as a building block and described the strategy&#8208;guided design of a synthetic receptor agonist with fine&#8208;tuned agonism. The developed synthetic partial agonist can regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting fine&#8208;tuned receptor signaling.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich High&#8208;Entropy Oxide Nanosheets for Efficient 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) nanosheets with high surface area are synthesized through a plasma strategy under low&#8208;temperature. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the HEOs nanosheets with superior electrocatalytic activity for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 nanosheets deliver improved activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method. Our method opens new opportunities for synthesizing nanostructured HEOs with great potential applications.

         <title>Rapid Luminescent Enhancement Triggered by One&#8208;shot Needlestick&#8208;stimulus Using a Liquescent Gold(I) Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence from a bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt of gold(I) complex with an N&#8208;heterocycliccarbene&#8208;based ligand increased rapidly upon application of a needlestick&#8208;stimulus. Upon stimulation under UV&#8208;light irradiation, the weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state rapidly transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds.







Abstract
Luminescence from a gold(I) complex with an N&#8208;heterocycliccarbene&#8208;based ligand, 1+&#8901;NTf2&#8722;, increased rapidly upon the application of one&#8208;shot needlestick&#8208;stimulus. The weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid&#8208;state of 1+&#8901;NTf2&#8722; was prepared by cooling its melted liquid to 90&#8201;&#176;C. Upon applying a weak pinpoint stimulus with a needle, this weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds. The emission after applying the stimulus could be visualized upon UV excitation even under ambient room light. This sequential phase transition from a stable solid to a liquid and then to a metastable solid could occur repeatedly without any measurable degradation of the complex. Various shapes could be prepared by casting the liquid&#8208;state complex into molds of different designs. This rapid response is thought to be triggered by the flexible intermolecular interactions in the kinetically generated aggregates formed upon cooling the liquid state, and by the strong Au&#8211;Au interactions in the thermodynamically stable crystals after applying the needlestick&#8208;stimulus.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Cesium Manganese Bromides Nanocrystals with Color&#8208;Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides nanocrystals, which achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity.







Abstract
For display applications, it is highly desirable to obtain tunable red/green/blue emission. However, lead&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) generally exhibit broadband emission with poor color purity. Herein, we developed a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides NCs and we can achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity in these NCs. Such phase transition can be triggered by isopropanol: from one dimensional (1D) CsMnBr3 NCs (red&#8208;color emission) to zero dimensional (0D) Cs3MnBr5 NCs (green&#8208;color emission). Furthermore, in a humid environment both 1D CsMnBr3 NCs and 0D Cs3MnBr5 NCs can be transformed into 0D Cs2MnBr4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O NCs (blue&#8208;color emission). Cs2MnBr4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O NCs could inversely transform into the mixture of CsMnBr3 and Cs3MnBr5 phase during the thermal annealing dehydration step. Our work highlights the tunable optical properties in single component NCs via phase engineering and provides a new avenue for future endeavors in light&#8208;emitting devices.

Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;2&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O NCs could inversely transform into the mixture of CsMnBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;MnBr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; phase during the thermal annealing dehydration step. Our work highlights the tunable optical properties in single component NCs via phase engineering and provides a new avenue for future endeavors in light-emitting devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Indolizy Carbene Ligand. Evaluation of Electronic Properties and Applications in Asymmetric Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuI complexes coordinated to the Indolizy ligand, a new carbene ligand that results from the gold&#8208;promoted cyclization of a pyridyl&#8208;allene were investigated. The electronic properties of the Indolizy ligand were analysed. The introduction of a stereogenic center in &#945;&#8208;position to the carbene center coupled to the introduction of a pending phosphine oxide group affords highly efficient and enantioselective AuI catalysts.







Abstract
We report herein a new family of carbene ligands based on an indolizine&#8208;ylidene (Indolizy) moiety. The corresponding gold(I) complexes are easily obtained from the gold(I)&#8208;promoted cyclization of allenylpyridine precursors. Evaluation of the electronic properties by experimental methods and also by DFT calculations confirms strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands. Cationization of the gold(I) complexes generates catalytic species that trigger diverse reactions of (poly)unsaturated precursors. When armed with a methylene phosphine oxide moiety on the stereogenic center adjacent to the nitrogen atom, the corresponding bifunctional carbene ligands give rise to highly enantioselective heterocyclizations. DFT calculations brought some rationalization and highlighted the critical roles played by the phosphine oxide group and the tosylate anion in the asymmetric cyclization of &#947;&#8208;allenols.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Conjugated Polymers under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From fibers to flakes&#8212;Modifying the morphology of supramolecular organization through vibrational strong coupling.







Abstract
Strong coupling plays a significant role in influencing chemical reactions and tuning material properties by modifying the energy landscapes of the systems. Here we study the effect of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on supramolecular organization. For this purpose, a rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymer known to form gels was strongly coupled together with its solvent in a microfluidic IR Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity. Absorption and fluorescence studies indicate a large modification of the self&#8208;assembly under such cooperative VSC. Electron microscopy confirms that in this case, the supramolecular morphology is totally different from that observed in the absence of strong coupling. In addition, the self&#8208;assembly kinetics are altered and depend on the solvent vibration under VSC. The results are compared to kinetic isotope effects on the self&#8208;assembly to help clarify the role of different parameters under strong coupling. These findings indicate that VSC is a valuable new tool for controlling supramolecular assemblies with broad implications for the molecular and material sciences.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Phosphite&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenation of &#945;&#8208;Diketones Enables Wolff Rearrangement and Staudinger Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic C=O bond activation is enabled by exploring the unprecedented photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes formed from &#945;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, which provides a novel diazo&#8208;free access to the Wolff rearrangement. The strategy was successfully applied to the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and valuable &#946;&#8208;lactams.







Abstract
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic activation of C=O bonds by exploiting the photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes, readily accessible from &#945;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, is reported. This mild and environmentally friendly strategy provides an unprecedented and efficient access to the Wolff rearrangement reaction which traditionally entails &#945;&#8208;diazoketones as precursors. The resulting ketenes could be precisely trapped by alcohols/thiols to give &#945;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and by imines to afford the valuable &#946;&#8208;lactams in up to 99&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Glycine from Oxalic acid and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In manufacturing C&#8208;N bond&#8208;containing compounds, it is important challenge to alternate the conventional methodologies that utilize reactive substrates, toxic reagents and organic solvents. In this study, we developed an electrochemical method to synthesize a C&#8208;N bond&#8208;containing molecule avoiding the use of cyanides and amines by harnessing nitrate (NO  3  &#8208;  ) as a nitrogen source in an aqueous electrolyte. In addition, we utilized oxalic acid as a carbon source which can be obtained from electrochemical conversion of CO  2  , so that our approach can provide a route for the utilization of anthropogenic CO  2  and nitrate wastes which cause serious environmental problems including global warming and eutrophication. Interestingly, the coreduction of oxalic acid and nitrate generated reactive intermediates, which led to C&#8208;N bond formation followed by further reduction to an amino acid, namely, glycine. By carefully controlling this multireduction process with a fabricated Cu&#8208;Hg electrode, we demonstrated the efficient production of glycine with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of up to 43.1% at &#8208;1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density = ~90 mA cm  &#8208;2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis by Br&#248;nsted Acid/Carbodicarbene Mimicking Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Like Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present of co&#8208;modulator alcohol, the putative strong &#963; donor, CDC is reshaped into frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;like reactivity. The unique synergistic FLP behavior of CDC; unachievable by its counterpart NHCs, show to have beneficial and complementary effects on isocyanate cyclotrimerization, LA polymerization, MMA polymerization and dehydrosilylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Carbodicarbene (CDC), unique carbenic entities bearing two lone pairs of electrons are well&#8208;known for their strong Lewis basicity. We demonstrate herein, upon introducing a weak Br&#248;nsted acid benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as a co&#8208;modulator, CDC is remolded into a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;like reactivity. DFT calculation and experimental evidence show BnOH loosely interacting with the binding pocket of CDC via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Four distinct reactions in nature were deployed to demonstrate the viability of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as synergistic FLP/Modulator (CDC/BnOH), demonstrating enhanced catalytic reactivity in cyclotrimerization of isocyanate, polymerization process for L&#8208;lactide (LA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and dehydrosilylation of alcohols. Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity. This finding also provides a new spin in diversifying FLP reactivity with co&#8208;modulator or co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>A Chemistry and Microstructure Perspective on Ion&#8208;Conducting Membranes for Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The membrane in redox flow batteries (RFBs) plays a critical role in their practical application. Promising RFB membranes require the deliberate design of their materials chemistry and microstructure. This Review highlights the design rationales of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level with in&#8208;depth discussion of the structure&#8211;property relationships, and subsequently discusses future prospect in the field.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are among the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability, and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion&#8208;conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly. Specific systems must meet additional requirements, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this Review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with an emphasis on new chemistry, novel microstructures, and innovative fabrication strategies. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.

         <title>Enabling Cysteine&#8208;Free Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with a Ligation Auxiliary Capable of Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MPyE group is the first sulfur based auxiliary enabling peptide ligation at proline and &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids. The pyridine nitrogen probably acts as a base that catalyzes the S&#8594;N acyl transfer during native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a MnII complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.

         <title>Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Ligands Enable Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Protoboration and Protosilylation of Terminal Alkynes: A Versatile Portal to Functionalized Alkenes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper catalysts bearing cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands exhibit remarkably high Markovikov selectivity in the protoboration and &#8208;silylation of terminal alkynes. This work demonstrates the ability of this strongly &#963;&#8208;donating family of ligands to perturb regioselectivity in the addition of copper&#8722;boryl species to C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
Regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes represents a straightforward route to access alkenyl boronate and silane building blocks. In previously reported catalytic systems, high selectivity is achieved with a limited scope of substrates and/or reagents, with general solutions lacking. Herein, we describe a selective copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes that is facilitated by strongly donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands. Using this method, both alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted alkynes are coupled with a variety of boryl and silyl reagents with high &#945;&#8208;selectivity. The reaction is scalable, and the products are versatile intermediates that can participate in various downstream transformations. Preliminary mechanistic experiments shed light on the role of CAAC ligands in this process.

         <title>Molecular Brush Surfactants: Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of cooperative assembly between hydrophilic molecular brushes and hydrophobic oligomeric ligands, the molecular brush surfactant (MBS) is formed. With MBSs at the oil&#8211;water interface, stable emulsions can be easily prepared in a one&#8208;step process. When jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in highly nonequilibrium shapes, e.g., liquid letters.







Abstract
Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time&#8208;consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water&#8208;soluble molecular brushes and oil&#8208;soluble oligomeric ligands, the in situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all&#8208;liquid biomimetic system.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with free COOH groups and suitable pore confinement demonstrates excellent performance for the important and challenging C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) mixture is desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Realizing efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging owing to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a functionalized HOF (HOF&#8208;16) with free &#8208;COOH sites for the efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. Under ambient conditions, HOF&#8208;16 shows a significant C3H6/C3H8 uptake difference (by 76&#8201;%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8208;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of HOF&#8208;16 was validated by breakthrough experiments. HOF&#8208;16 is stable towards strong acidity and water.

         <title>Mechanically Triggered Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction was developed for the detection and amplification of cell mechanics. It enables the quantification of cellular receptor forces with improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on a microscope and in a more rapid manner with a conventional plate reader.







Abstract
Cells transmit piconewton forces to receptors to mediate processes such as migration and immune recognition. A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano&#8208;HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano&#8208;HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano&#8208;IC50 for aspirin, Y&#8208;27632, and eptifibatide. Given that cell mechanical phenotypes are of clinical importance, mechano&#8208;HCR may offer a convenient route for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Enantiospecific Detection of D&#8208;Amino Acid through Synergistic Upconversion Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoprobe for D&#8208;amino acid enantiospecific detection was proposed based on synergistic upconversion energy transfer, featuring a wide detection range, low detection limit, and in vivo noninvasive detection with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
D&#8208;amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases. However, current DAA detection strategies mainly rely on bulky instrumentation or electrochemical probes, limiting their cellular and animal applications. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;coupled nanoprobe that can detect enantiospecific DAAs through synergistic energy transfer. This nanoprobe offers near&#8208;infrared upconversion capability, a wide dynamic detection range, and a detection limit of 2.2&#8197;&#956;M, providing a versatile platform for in vivo noninvasive detection of DAAs with high enantioselectivity. These results potentially allow real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecular handedness in living animals, as well as developing antipsychotic treatment strategies.

         <title>NIR&#8208;triggered intracellular H+ transients for lamellipodia&#8208;collapsed antimetastasis and enhanced chemodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solid tumours, tumour invasion and metastasis account for 90% of cancer&#8208;related deaths. Cell migration is steered by the lamellipodia formed at the leading edge. These lamellipodia can drive the cell body forward via its mechanical deformation regulated by cofilin. Inhibiting cofilin activity can cause significant defects in directional lamellipodia formation and the locomotory capacity of cell invasion, thus contributing to antimetastatic treatment. Here, a near infrared light (NIR)&#8208;controlled nanoscale proton supplier was designed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with a core coated in MIL&#8208;88B for interior photoacids loading; this photoacids loading can boost H+  transients in cells, which converts the cofilin to an inactive form. Strikingly, inactive cofilin loses the ability to mediate lamellipodia deformation for cell migration. Additionally, the iron, which serves as a catalytic active centre in MIL&#8208;88B, initiates an enhanced Fenton reaction due to the increased H+  in the tumour, ultimately achieving intensive chemodynamic therapy (CDT). This work provides new insight into H+  transients in cells, which not only regulates cofilin protonation for antimetastatic treatment but also improves chemodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>MnO2 Electrocatalysts Coordinating Alcohol Oxidation for Ultra&#8208;durable Hydrogen and Chemical Productions in Acidic Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic hydrogen production under acidic conditions is of great importance for industrialization in comparison to that in alkaline media, which, unfortunately, still remains great challenges due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant, cost&#8208;effective and highly active anodic electrocatalysts that can be used durably under strongly acidic conditions. Here we report an unexpected finding that manganese oxide, a kind of common non&#8208;noble catalysts easily soluble in acidic solutions, can be applied as a highly efficient and extremely durable anodic electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from an acidic aqueous solution of alcohols. Particularly in a glycerol solution, a potential of as low as 1.36 V (vs. RHE) is needed at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , which is 270 mV lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to oxidize glycerol into value&#8208;added chemicals such as formic acid, without oxygen production. To our surprise, the manganese oxide exhibits extremely high stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen production in coupling with glycerol oxidation for longer than 865 hours compared to shorter than 10 h for OER. Moreover, the effect of the addition of glycerol on the electrochemical durability has been probed via  in situ  Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. This work opens an unprecedented window that acidity&#8208;unstable metal oxide electrocatalysts can be used robustly in acidic media under the presence of certain substances for electrochemical purposes, such as hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;mediator&#8208;effector cascade systems for amplified protein kinase activity imaging and phosphorylation&#8208;induced drug release in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases constitute a rich pool of biomarkers and therapeutic targets of tremendous diseases including cancer. However, sensing kinase activity  in vivo  while implementing treatments according to kinase hyperactivation remains challenging. Herein, we present a nano&#8208;mediator&#8208;effector cascade system that can  in situ  magnify the subtle events of kinase&#8208;catalyzed phosphorylation  via  DNA amplification machinery to achieve kinase activity imaging and kinase&#8208;responsive drug release  in vivo  . In this cascade, the phosphorylation&#8208;mediated disassembly of DNA/peptide complex on the nanomediators initiated the detachment of fluorescent hairpin DNAs from the nanoeffectors  via  hybridization chain reaction (HCR), leading to fluorescence recovery and therapeutic cargo release. We demonstrated that this nanosystem simultaneously enabled trace protein kinase A (PKA) activity imaging and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for inhibition of tumor cell growth both  in vitro  and  in vivo  , affording a kinase&#8208;specific sense&#8208;and&#8208;treat paradigm for cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Multidimensional Photocatalysts for Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  In this work, ultrathin porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks MOFs (2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets, TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate photoinduced electron/energy transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were successfully achieved using ZnTCPP nanosheets as a photocatalyst. The synthesized polymers exhibited narrow molecular weight distributions (MWDs) and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, the 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were successfully applied as photocatalysts for implementation in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects. In addition to providing an efficient catalytic system, ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials. Finally, the presence of ZnTCPP embedded in the materials conferred effective antimicrobial activity under visible light via the production of singlet oxygen, affording 98.05 &#177; 1.08% and 93.80 &#177; 1.98% anti&#8208;bacterial efficiency against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds via Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Escape from flatland: Increased saturation (fraction of sp3) is more likely to be successful when moving compounds through the drug development pipeline. Bridged nitrogen heterocycles have a huge potential in drug discovery, although long synthetic sequences are typically required. New step&#8208;economic and selective organic synthesis is therefore highly sought after. Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106716) the synthesis of the normorphan skeleton through challenging tandem catalysis. Cover design by Joris Snaet.

         <title>Nanoscale Advancement Continues&#8212;From Catalysts and Reagents to Restructuring of Reaction Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the highlighted article, the effect of alkane and water additives on the structure of several ionic liquids was used to increase the acidity of liquid reaction media and to accelerate the acid&#8208;catalyzed transformations. A possible connection between the appearance of a pronounced microstructure of the obtained systems and their performance in catalytic processes was proposed on the basis of microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.







Abstract
Comprehensive studies dedicated to the search for specific properties of matter at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales have greatly enriched the fields of chemistry and materials science. From the point of view of synthetic chemistry, discoveries in the field of nanoscale catalysis, in which the size effects of active centers are used to accelerate the reactions, are of particular importance. However, another approach for the promotion of chemical transformations based on the micro&#8208; or nanoconfinement of reacting molecules or even on the structuring of the reaction media as a whole is gaining interest as a highly valuable tool. Herein, we highlight the example of an increase in the efficiency of phenol alkylation and tert&#8208;butylation of benzyl alcohol in reaction media based on ionic liquids by the creation of acidic microdomains in the presence of small molecule additives.

         <title>Probing the Paradigm of Promiscuity for N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes and their Protein Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir complexes showed distinctive reactivity to hen egg white lysozyme by forming adducts at different binding sites and/or underwent different ligand exchange reactions. Protein crystallography, mass spectrometry and computational studies demonstrated the role of the metal centers and the protein microenvironment in determining their selectivity for a specific site.







Abstract
Metal complexes can be considered a &#8220;paradigm of promiscuity&#8221; when it comes to their interactions with proteins. They often form adducts with a variety of donor atoms in an unselective manner. We have characterized the adducts formed between a series of isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir centers and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Distinctive behavior for the metal compounds was observed with the more labile Ru and Rh complexes targeting mainly a surface l&#8208;histidine moiety through cleavage of p&#8208;cymene or NHC co&#8208;ligands, respectively. In contrast, the more inert Os and Ir derivatives were detected abundantly in an electronegative binding pocket after undergoing ligand exchange of a chlorido ligand for an amino acid side chain. Computational studies supported the binding profiles and hinted at the role of the protein microenvironment for metal complexes eliciting selectivity for specific binding sites on the protein.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Phosphors: Highly Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution and Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the highest quantum yield ambient solution state (ca. 41.8&#8201;%) and hydrogel (ca. 34&#8201;%) room temperature phosphorescence, by employing an organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy is reported. These soft&#8208;hybrids are further employed as an efficient light&#8208;harvesting scaffold by co&#8208;anchoring acceptor dyes to yield triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer mediated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Solution phase room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic phosphors is seldom realized. Herein we report one of the highest quantum yield solution state RTP (ca. 41.8&#8201;%) in water, from a structurally simple phthalimide phosphor, by employing an organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy. We further use these supramolecular hybrid phosphors as a light&#8208;harvesting scaffold to achieve delayed fluorescence from orthogonally anchored Sulforhodamine acceptor dyes via an efficient triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET), which is rarely achieved in solution. Electrostatic cross&#8208;linking of the inorganic scaffold at higher concentrations further facilitates the formation of self&#8208;standing hydrogels with efficient RTP and energy&#8208;transfer mediated long&#8208;lived fluorescence.

         <title>Chemoresponsive Supramolecular Polypseudorotaxanes with Infinite Switching Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel polypseudorotaxane [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. It depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 upon addition of H and AgSF6, while it reforms with successive addition of G. The transformations between [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n and H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 can be switched for infinite cycles.







Abstract
Chemoresponsive supramolecular systems with infinite switching capability are important for applications in recycled materials and intelligent devices. To attain this objective, here a chemoresponsive polypseudorotaxane is reported on the basis of a bis(p&#8208;phenylene)&#8208;34&#8208;crown&#8208;10 macrocycle (H) and a cyano&#8208;substituted viologen guest (G). H and G form a [2]pseudorotaxane (H&#8835;G) both in solution and in the solid state. Upon addition of AgSF6, a polypseudorotaxane (denoted as [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n) forms as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane (denoted as H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2) upon addition of H and AgSF6, while it reforms with successive addition of G. The transformations between [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n and H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 can be switched for infinite cycles, superior to the conventional chemoresponsive supramolecular polymeric systems with limited switching capability.

         <title>Superatom&#8208;in&#8208;Superatom [RhH@Ag24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom concept was demonstrated for the first time. A rhodium hydride (RhH) superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom [RhH@Ag24(SR)18]2&#8722; nanocluster. The Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 framework by forming the RhH superatom resembling the closed d&#8208;shell Pd atom ([Kr]4d10).







Abstract
Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24 framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24 framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.

The Rh atom with open d-shells ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) could be incorporated into the Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; framework by forming the RhH superatom resembling the closed d-shell Pd atom ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d-shells, the doping of open d-shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SPhMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d-shells ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is incorporated into the Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d-shells ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; framework was co-doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SPhMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SPhMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanocluster with the superatomic 8-electron configuration (1S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1P&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom-in-superatom nanocluster.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning the Circular Dichroism and Circular Polarized Luminescence Intensities of Chiral 2D Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites through Halogenation of the Organic Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By incorporating various halogen (F, Cl, Br, and I)&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the effects of chiral molecules on chiroptical properties of hybrid organic inorganic perovskite (HOIP) are investigated. Among them, the HOIP having Cl&#8208;substituted chiral cation exhibits the highest circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) intensities, indicating the existence of the largest rotatory strength, whereas the F&#8208;substituted one shows the weakest intensities. The observed modulation can be correlated to the varied magnetic transition dipole of HOIPs, which is sensitive to the d&#8208;spacing between inorganic layers and the halogen&#8208;halogen interaction between organic cations and the inorganic sheets. Although a larger angular momentum of organic cation is expected as the atomic number of the  para&#8208;  substituent increases, the simultaneous increase in atom size enlarges the d&#8208;spacing of the HOIPs, thereby lowering the magnetic transition dipole. However, the strong halogen&#8208;halogen interaction existing in Cl&#8208;substituted system leads to a significantly increased rotational strength. These offsetting effects meet the optimal CD and CPL intensity with chlorine substitution, rendering the rotatory strength of HOIPs arranged in the order of (ClMBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(BrMBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(IMBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(MBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(FMBA)  2  PbI  4  . The modulation of the magnetic transition dipoles of HOIP paves the new avenue for designing hybrid perovskite&#8208;based spintronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Hydrogen Production and Transfer Hydrogenation with Selenite Promoted Electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;Nitrotoluenes to E&#8208;Nitroethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an electrochemical carbon&#8208;added reaction with accelerated kinetics to replace the low&#8208;value and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is markedly significant to pure hydrogen production. Regulating the critical steps to precisely design electrode materials to selectively synthesize targeted compounds is highly desirable. Here, inspired by the surfaced adsorbed SeO  x  2&#8208;  promoting OER, NiSe is demonstrated to be an efficient anode enabling &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene electrooxidation to E&#8208;nitroethene with up to 99% selectivity, 89% Faradic efficiency, and the reaction rate of 0.25 mmol cm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  via inhibiting side reactions for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen generation. The high performance can be associated with its in situ formed NiOOH surface layer and absorbed SeO  x  2&#8208;  via Se leaching&#8208;oxidation during electrooxidation, and the preferential adsorption of two &#8211;NO  2  groups of intermediate on NiOOH. A self&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;carbon radicals and subsequent elimination of a nitrite molecule pathway is proposed. Wide substrate scope, scale&#8208;up synthesis of E&#8208;nitroethene, and paired productions of E&#8208;nitroethene and hydrogen or N&#8208;protected aminoarenes over a bifunctional NiSe electrode highlight the promising potential. Gold also displays a similar promoting effect for &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene transformation like SeO  x  2&#8208;  , rationalizing the strategy of designing materials to suppress side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Oxidative&#8208;Cyanation of Aldehydes to Nitriles over Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative&#8208;cyanation of aldehydes provides a promising strategy for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of organic nitriles. Design of robust and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is the key for this route. Herein, we designed a series of Se,S,N&#8208;  tri  &#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with a hierarchical porous structure (denoted as Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;  x  ,  x  represents the pyrolysis temperature). It was found that the obtained Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;  1000  was very selective and efficient for oxidative&#8208;cyanation of various aldehydes including those containing other oxidizable groups into the corresponding nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource below 100  o  C. Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent performance of Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;  1000  originated mainly from the graphitic&#8208;N species with lower electron density and synergistic effect between the Se, S, N, and C in the catalyst. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure could also promote the reaction. Notably, the unique feature of this metal&#8208;free catalyst is that it tolerated other oxidizable groups, and showed no activity on further reaction of the products, thereby resulting in high selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first work for the synthesis of nitriles  via  oxidative&#8208;cyanation of aldehydes over heterogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A reinvestigation of the linalool synthase from  Chryseobacterium polytrichastri  uncovered its diterpene synthase activity, yielding polytrichastrene A and polytrichastrol A with new skeletons, besides known wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene and thunbergol. The enzyme mechanism was investigated by isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations to explain an unusual ethyl group formation. Rationally designed exchanges of active site residues showed major functional switches, resulting for I66F in the production of five more new compounds, including polytrichastrene B and polytrichastrol B, while A87T, A192V and the double exchange A87T,A192V gave a product shift towards wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

Both cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) (  2  ) and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) (  4  ), in addition to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi) (  6  ), demonstrate the capability to cleave the sulfur&#8208;sulfur bonds in  1  , giving carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L  0  ) zwitterions (  3  and  5  ) and a spirocyclic silicon&#8208;dithiolene compound (  7  ), respectively. The bonding nature of  3  ,  5  , and  7  are probed by both experimental and theoretical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>{BiW8O30} Exerts Antitumor Effect by Triggering Pyroptosis and Upregulating Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. At 24 h post&#8208;incubation, the IC50 values of {BiW8} against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3 &#956;M, respectively. The IC50 value of {BiW8} on the MG63 cells was more than 2&#8208;fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by {BiW8}. {BiW8} increased 2&#8208;fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24 h post&#8208;incubation. Compared with 0 h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59%, 65%, 75%, 94%, and 97% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post&#8208;incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of {BiW8} were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a continuous need for novel microbial natural products to fill the drying&#8208;up drug development pipeline. Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules that consist of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a linear fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The experiments of genome sequencing, gene insertion mutation, isotope labelling, and precursor feeding demonstrated that the fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the origin of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole was related to the vitamin B12 metabolism. The convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways through a &#65279;C&#8208;N coupling led to the unique chemical framework of myxadazoles, which is an unprecedented hybridization mode in the paradigm of natural products. Myxadazoles exhibited potent vasculogenesis promotion effect and moderate antithrombotic activity, underscoring their potential usage for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Designable Assembly of Aluminum Molecular Rings for Sequential Confinement of Iodine Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although numerous adsorbent materials have been reported for radioactive iodine capture, demands for the development of new absorbents that are economically viable and featured with reliable synthetic protocols still exist. Herein, in this paper, a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy towards adsorbents for sequential confinement of iodine molecules is reported. It should be noticed that these adsorbents are versatile heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions and conjugated carboxylate ligands. Additionally, these materials can quickly remove iodine from cyclohexane solutions with a high removal rate (98.8%) and considerable loading capacity (555.06 mg/g). Heterometallic frameworks provided distinct pore sizes and binding sites toward iodine molecules and realize crystallographic visualization concerning sequential confinement of iodine molecules. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8208;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Potential Driven High&#8208;Throughput Molecular Electronic and Spintronic devices: From Molecules to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by assembling either single or ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis which is often termed &#8216;molecular electronics&#8217;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules offering an additional scope to create ultra&#8208;fast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular&#8208;thin films on a suitable electrode, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique emerges as highly efficient in various aspects. The key focus of this review is to describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven growth of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. Although there have been several bottlenecks with the scaling&#8208;up, fabrication and operational mechanism, still we foresee that the molecular devices can hold the potentials to compete against physical and economic barriers for commercial success soon.</dc:description>

         <title>Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field boosts universal reduction of NOx&#8208; in water to ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NOx&#8208; reduction acts a pivotal part in sustaining globally balanced nitrogen cycle and restoring ecological environment, ammonia (NH3) is an excellent energy carrier and the most valuable product among all the products of NOx&#8208; reduction reaction, the selectivity of which is far from satisfaction due to the intrinsic complexity of multiple&#8208;electron NOx&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. Here, we utilize the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field, by the construction of high density of electron&#8208;deficient Ni nanoparticles inside nitrogen&#8208;rich carbons, to facilitate the enrichment and fixation of all NO  x  &#8208;  anions on the electrode surface, including NO  3  &#8208;  and NO  2  &#8208;  , and thus ensure the final selectivity to NH  3  . Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that NO  x  &#8208;  anions were continuously captured by the electrode with largely enhanced surface electric field, providing excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99 % from both electrocatalytic NO  3  &#8208;  &#160;and NO  2  &#8208;  reduction. Remarkably, the NH  3  yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1 mg h  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;2  in electrocatalytic&#160;NO  2  &#8208;  &#160;reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NO  x  &#8208;  pollutants, including seawater or waste water, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Enamide&#8208;Imine Tautomerism in the Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient protocol for kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols has been developed through an unprecedented asymmetric enamide&#8208;imine tautomerism process enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A broad range of racemic 2&#8208;arylsulfonamido tertiary allyl alcohols could be kinetically resolved with excellent kinetic resolution performances (with  s  &#8208;factor up to &gt;200). This method is particularly effective for a series of 1,1&#8208;dialkyl substituted allyl alcohols, which produced chiral tertiary alcohols that would be difficult to access via other asymmetric methods. Facile and versatile transformations of the chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imine and enamide products, especially the efficient stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino tertiary alcohols using one enantiomer of the catalyst, demonstrated the value of this kinetic resolution method.</dc:description>
