         <title>Expanding the Landscape of Phosphorous&#8208;Based Open Shell Species: Stable Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Trianionic Radicals Based on a Contorted Triphosphaalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequential single&#8208;electron reduction of a truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene afforded mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triradical anionic species. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly contorted truxene core in the solid&#8208;state structures of mono&#8208; and dianions. The significant structural contortion is further associated with the emergence of open&#8208;shell electronic configurations in the di&#8208; and trianionic species.







Abstract
The stepwise reduction of the highly contorted truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene 1 using KC8 led to the isolation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;anionic species. The solid&#8208;state molecular structures of mono&#8208; and diradical anionic species were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, revealing elongated P&#8722;C bonds and a pronounced &#8220;indene&#8221; aromatization compared to the parent system. All three radical species displayed distinct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, providing compelling evidence for the open&#8208;shell electronic configuration of both the diradical and triradical species&#8212;an observation unprecedented in any previously reported phosphorous&#8208;based anionic polyradicals. Mulliken spin density calculations revealed a dominant localization of radical spin on a single phosphorous atom in the monoanion. In the dianion, spin localization is observed on two phosphorous atoms (~34&#8201;% each), with a minor contribution from the third phosphorous (0.13&#8201;%), while the trianion demonstrates a uniform distribution of spin density (~30&#8201;%) across each phosphorous atom.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Oxetanes Catalyzed by an Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective protein engineering of halohydrin dehalogenases was conducted to access both R and S enantiomers starting from racemic oxetanes or &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols. The variants display high stereoselectivity and activity for both the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols and ring opening of oxetanes through kinetic resolution, yielding a broad range of functional chiral oxetanes and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols.







Abstract
Although biocatalysis has garnered widespread attention in both industrial and academic realms, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral oxetanes remains an underdeveloped field. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are industrially relevant enzymes that have been engineered to accomplish the reversible transformation of epoxides. In this study, a biocatalytic platform was constructed for the stereoselective kinetic resolution of chiral oxetanes and formation of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols. HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 was engineered to identify key variants capable of catalyzing the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols (via HheC M1&#8208;M3) and ring opening of oxetanes (via HheC M4&#8208;M5) to access both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configured products with high stereoselectivity and remarkable catalytic activity, yielding up to 49&#8201;% with enantioselectivities exceeding 99&#8201;% ee and E&gt;200. The current strategy is broadly applicable as demonstrated by expansion of the substrate scope to include up to 18 examples for dehalogenation and 16 examples for ring opening. Additionally, the functionalized products are versatile building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms for the relevant variants, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed. The current strategy expands the scope of HHDH&#8208;catalyzed chiral oxetane ring construction, offering efficient access to both enantiomers of chiral oxetanes and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols.

         <title>Glycosylated AIE&#8208;active Red Light&#8208;triggered Photocage with Precisely Tumor Targeting Capability for Synergistic Type I Photodynamic Therapy and CPT Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a lactosylated photocage prodrug that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles BT&#8208;LRCs for type I photodynamic therapy and camptothecin (CPT) chemotherapy. Under the regulation of lactose units, BT&#8208;LRCs exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior and remarkable superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation efficiency, and CPT was subsequently released upon light irradiation. This strategy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic effect in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Photocaging is an emerging protocol for precisely manipulating spatial and temporal behaviors over biological activity. However, the red/near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered photolysis process of current photocage is largely singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;dependent and lack of compatibility with other reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated techniques, which has proven to be the major bottleneck in achieving efficient and precise treatment. Herein, we reported a lactosylated photocage BT&#8208;LRC by covalently incorporating camptothecin (CPT) into hybrid BODIPY&#8208;TPE fluorophore via the superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;)&#8208;cleavable thioketal bond for type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anticancer drug release. Amphiphilic BT&#8208;LRC could be self&#8208;assembled into aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanoparticles (BT&#8208;LRCs) owing to the regulation of carbohydrate&#8208;carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) among neighboring lactose units in the nanoaggregates. BT&#8208;LRCs could simultaneously generate abundant O2&#8722;&#8901; through the aggregation modulated by lactose interactions, and DNA&#8208;damaging agent CPT was subsequently and effectively released. Notably, the type I PDT and CPT chemotherapy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic efficacy in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Furthermore, the inherent AIE property of BT&#8208;LRCs endowed the photocaged prodrug with superior bioimaging capability, which provided a powerful tool for real&#8208;time tracking and finely tuning the PDT and photoactivated drug release behavior in tumor therapy.

         <title>Binary Iron&#8208;Manganese Cocatalyst for Simultaneous Activation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O Bonds to Maximally Utilize Lignin for Syngas Generation over InGaN</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;powered lignin reforming offers a carbon&#8208;neutral route for syngas production. This study explores a dual non&#8208;precious iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst to simultaneously activate both C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bonds for maximizing the utilization of various substituents of native lignin to yield syngas. By assembling with InGaN nanowires on a Si wafer, the as&#8208;designed dual FeMn cocatalyst affords a measurable syngas evolution rate of 42.4 mol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 from native lignin in distilled water with a high selectivity of 93% and tunable H2/CO ratios under concentrated light, leading to a considerable light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency of 11.8%. The high FeMn atom efficiency arising from the 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructure of InGaN enables the achievement of a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 220896 mol syngas per mol FeMn per hour. By correlating exploration&#160;experiments,&#160;the critical role of the dual FeMn cocatalyst in the evolving mechanism of lignin and water toward syngas is disclosed at the atomic level. It is discovered that the synergetic iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst supported by InGaN nanowires enables simultaneous activation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bonds with comparable minimized dissociation energies.&#160;This work demonstrates a new and earth&#8208;abundant bifunctional cocatalyst for utilizing various substituents of lignin to produce syngas powered by sunlight beyond fossil fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Interweavable Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Fibers for Indirect Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of indirect electrocatalysis toward potential industrial processes are drastically limited by the utilization or processing forms of electrocatalysts. The remaining challenges of electrocatalysts like the recycling in homogeneous systems or pulverization in heterogeneous systems call for advanced processing forms to meet the desired requirements. Here, we report a series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers (M&#8208;PF, M = Ni, Cu and Zn) through a rigid&#8208;flexible polymerization strategy based on rigid metalloporphyrin and flexible thiourea units that can be applied as heterogenous redox&#8208;mediators in indirect electrocatalysis. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be processed into different fiber&#8208;forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or even interweaved networks. Interestingly, they can be readily applied in S&#8208;S bond cleaving/cyclization reaction or extended oxidative self&#8208;coupling reaction of thiols with high efficiency. Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (1.25 g in a batch&#8208;experiment) under laboratory conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction on Cup&#8208;Stacked Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes feature one&#8208;dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge&#8208;plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs&#8208;C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near&#8208;unity NIR light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Core Polarity in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the charge density at the active site to balance the adsorption ability and reactivity of oxygen is extremely significant for driving a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we have highlighted the influence of intermolecular polarity in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical H2O2 production. Different C3 symmetric building blocks have been utilized to regulate the charge density at the active sites. The benzene&#8208;cored COF, which exhibits reduced polarity than the triazine&#8208;cored COF, displayed enhanced performance in H2O2 production, achieving 93.1% selectivity for H&#8322;O&#8322; at 0.4 V with almost two&#8208;electron transfer and a faradaic efficiency of 90.5%. In&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were employed to confirm H&#8322;O&#8322; generation and analyze spatial reactivity patterns. These techniques provided detailed insights into localized catalytic behavior, emphasizing the influence of core polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;substitution in Sr2[MgAl5N7]:Eu2+ for Spectroscopic Applications including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;high Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Sr2[Mg1&#8208;xLixAl5&#8208;xSixN7]:0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8208;Al]5+ by [Li&#8208;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated. With the entry of [Li&#8208;Si]5+ into theSr2[MgAl5N7]:0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ shifts the emission peak from 657 nm to 647 nm and reduces the excitation in green region. When the amount of [Li&#8208;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency is elevated by 49.6%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22W/mm2, which is a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650 nm to 702 nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07 nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Norbornadiene&#8208;Derived Infrared Transparent Polymers by Inverse Vulcanization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared (IR) transparent polymer materials prepared by inverse vulcanization, as a promising candidate to replace inorganic materials, are new materials for constructing key devices in IR optics. However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between infrared optical and thermal properties in polymers due to the intrinsic infrared absorption of organic materials. Herein, our strategy is to construct a high boiling point symmetrical molecular norbornadiene derivative cross&#8208;linking agent (DMMD) which can be inverse vulcanized with molten sulfur, and obtain Poly(S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) with different sulfur content by controlling the feed ratio of sulfur. With the rigid core and low IR activity in DMMD, the prepared polymers exhibit tunable thermal properties (Tg: 98.3&#8208;119.8 &#176;C) and high IR transmittance (medium&#8208;wave infrared region (MWIR): 42.9&#8208;52.6 %; long&#8208;wave infrared region (LWIR): 1.5&#8208;5.29 %). In addition, Poly(S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) can be used to prepare large&#8208;size free&#8208;standing Fresnel lenses for IR imaging by simple hot&#8208;pressing, which provides flexibility in the design and production of IR fine lenses. This study provides a novel strategy for balancing the thermal and optical properties of IR transparent polymer materials, while providing relevant references for balancing the IR optical and thermal properties of polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8208;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8208;N3 moieties anchored on N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8208;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8208;N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8208;Ni&#8943;Sn2&#8208;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8208;NSC based Li&#8208;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 C), as well as outstanding cycling&#8208;stability for 2400 cycles at 2 C and 3 C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 0.05 C and a retention capacity of 4.7 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C for Ni&#8208;NSC based Li&#8208;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88 mg cm&#8208;2. This work provides profound insight for rational optimizing microscopic electronic density of active site to promoting SROR in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient and durable single-atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li-S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni-N3 moieties anchored on N,S-codoped porous carbon (Ni-NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry-breaking charge transfer in Ni single-atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni-N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N-Ni&#8943;Sn2-, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni-NSC based Li-S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025 mAh g-1 at 1 C), as well as outstanding cycling-stability for 2400 cycles at 2 C and 3 C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8 mAh cm-2 at 0.05 C and a retention capacity of 4.7 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C for Ni-NSC based Li-S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88 mg cm-2.

         <title>Atomic Infusion Induced Reconstruction Enhancing Multifunctional Thermally Conductive Films with Robust Low&#8208;Frequency Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deterministic fabrication of highly thermally conductive composite film with satisfying low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic (EM) absorption performance exhibits great potential in advancing the application of 5G smart electric devices but persists challenge. Herein, a multifunctional flexible film combined with hetero&#8208;structured Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C (FWC&#8208;O@C) as the absorber and aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as the matrix was prepared. Driven by an atomic gradient infusion reduction strategy, the carbon atoms of absorbers can be precisely relocated from carbon shell to core oxometallate lattice and trigger in&#8208;situ carbothermic reduction for customizing unique oxometallate&#8208;carbide heterojunctions and deforming the surface geometrical structure. Such an atoms reconstruction process effectively regulates interface electronic structure and magnetic configuration, resulting in enhanced polarization loss from abundant heterointerfaces and crystal defects and magnetic loss from hierarchical structure endowed magnetic coupling interaction, which jointly contributes to the efficient low&#8208;frequency EM absorption performance. Eventually, optimized FWC&#8208;O@C microplate exhibits a broad absorption bandwidth surpassed the entire C band, and the assembled Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C/ANF composite film also performs a high thermal conductivity over 2500% higher than that of the pure ANF. These findings provide a new insight into the atomic reconstruction affected EM properties and a generalized methodological guidance for preparing multifunctional thermally conductive composite films.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6 steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS&#8217;s mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients.&#160; ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS&#8208;induced IBD colitis and Trex1&#8208;/&#8208; autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Electric Double Layer via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Stable Solid/Electrolyte Interphase on Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the cationic solvation structure with high donor&#8208;number (DN) additive is an effective strategy to construct a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Mg anode, which necessitates meticulous consideration of electrolyte chemistry and substantial quantities of additives. Notably, the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to anode is pivotal role in SEI formation yet remains understudied. In this study, we propose a novel self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy by utilizing (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFTMS, only 2 vol%, 1.4 mol%, 0.135 mol L&#8208;1), a low DN but strong Mg metal absorbability through electron&#8208;withdrawing groups(&#8722;CF3), to modulate the complex structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane. Through dipole&#8722;dipole interaction between the electronegative fluorine (&#8722;CF3 of TFTMS) and electropositive hydrogen (&#8722;CH3/&#8722;CH2 of solvents), TFTMS weakens solvent&#8722;Mg2+ coordination and thus enhances anion&#8722;Mg2+ interaction, inducing a stable and dense SEI with superior electronic insulation to realize horizontal Mg plating/stripping. Consequently, the designed electrolytes enable the symmetric cells to cycle stable for up to 1000 hours and reversible Mg plating/stripping under 5 mA cm&#8208;2, they show favorable compatibility with various cathodes. More importantly, the SAM strategy has good generality in other electrolyte systems, demonstrating a simple and effective route to promote the practical application of rechargeable magnesium battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8211;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8211;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8211;N=N&#8211;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8211;Br metalating agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23 mol% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pt Loaded on MOF&#8208;Derived Porous TiO2 with Maxim&#8208;ized Pt Atom Utilization for Selective Hydrogenation of Halonitro&#8208;benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800 &#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600 &#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single-atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single-atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti-MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;amp;TiO2@C-800) at 800 &#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal-driven atomization of PtNPs at 600 &#176;C in air produce single-atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2-600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2-600 exhibits superior p-chloroaniline (p-CAN) selectivity (99%) to PtNPs/TiO2-400 (45%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2-600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2-600 achieves 100% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p-CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p-CNB and p-CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activities and stability of oxide&#8208;supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8722;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI. Pt/rutile with oxygen vacancies achieves a 301 molCO&#215;gM&#8208;1&#215;h&#8208;1 space time yield and considerably catalytic stability (decreased by 8%) at 800 &#176;C over 100 h time&#8208;on&#8208;stream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption capacity of Pt NP on the rutile overlayer can be reduced by increasing electron density. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile is reduced by the oxygen vacancy defects on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species during CO2 hydrogenation, thereby preventing the formation of SMSI.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Ag/Cu2O interface for efficient neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbons (C2+) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO2 and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8211;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt; 300 mA cm&#8722;2). Here, we reported an optimized Ag&#8208;Cu2O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6% at 650 mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FEC2H4 of 66.0% with a partial current density of 429.1 mA cm&#8722;2, making it stand out among the reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu2O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu+/Cu0 active sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated the enhanced CO formation and C&#8211;C coupling at the Ag/Cu2O interface. This work reported an unprecedented neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 performance and provided an in&#8208;depth comprehension of the role of the bimetallic interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable bandgaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6 nGyair s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Structural Heterogeneity in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key to fully realizing the potential of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) lies in balancing their inherent local chemical disordering with the long&#8208;range ordering required for electrochemical applications. Herein, we synthesized a distinctive L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) exhibiting nanoscale long&#8208;range order and atomic scale short&#8208;range disorder via a lattice compensation strategy to mitigate the entropy reduction tendency. The (PtIr)(FeMoBi) catalyst exhibited remarkable activity and selectivity of glycollic acid (GA) production via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). With a mass activity of 5.2 A mgPt&#8211;1 and a Faradic efficiency (FE) for GA of 95 %, it outperformed most previously reported electrocatalysts for selective GA production. The lattice&#8208;compensation effect promotes the homogeneity of Pt and Fe actives sites, facilitating co&#8208;adsorption of EG and OH and reducing the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and OH&#8208;combination processes. This approach effectively avoids the formation of low&#8208;active sites commonly encountered in HEA solid solutions, offering a promising avenue for exploring the complex interplay between catalytic activity and HEI structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Strength in Numbers: A Giant NIR&#8208;II AIEgen with One&#8208;for&#8208;All Phototheranostic Features for Exceptional Orthotopic Bladder Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics that allows the simultaneous implementations of multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities by utilizing a single component, is growing into a sparkling frontier in cancer treatment. Of particular interest is phototheranostic agent with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. Nevertheless, the practical uses of those conventional NIR&#8208;II agents are severely impeded by their unsatisfactory features including insufficient stability, low synthetic yield, to be extended absorption/ emission wavelengths, and inefficient phototheranostic outcomes. Developing exceptional phototheranostic agents is thus highly desirable yet remains formidably challenging. Herein, we synthesized two novel N&#8208;heteroacenes&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II luminogens, namely 2TT&#8208;PPT and 4TT&#8208;PBPT, by respectively employing pyrene&#8208;fused phenaziothiadiazoles and pyrene&#8208;fused bisphenaziothiadiazoles as acceptor skeletons. There is strength in numbers by increasing the fusing rings in N&#8208;heteroacenes moieties and numbers of appended donors. Compared to less ring&#8208;fused 2TT&#8208;PPT, the giant molecule 4TT&#8208;PBPT shows improved photophysical characteristics, such as enhanced light absorbance, red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, higher brightness, favorable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and elevated photothermal conversion efficiency, which render 4TT&#8208;PBPT nanoparticles excellent fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy for orthotopic bladder cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Silver&#8208;Based Hybrid Pyroelectric Enabling Wide Spectral Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity for Birefringence Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric that enables wide spectral light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity, serving as a new pathway to modulate birefringence with the highest level of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the future advance of smart optical and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystal, which has the capacity to manipulate polarization light, holds an indispensable position in optics and optoelectronics, while it remains challenging to fulfill the modulation of birefringence. Here, we present wide spectral photo&#8208;pyroelectric effect in a silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 (N&#8208;CHM=N&#8208;cyclohexylmethylamine), serving as a feasible strategy to regulate birefringence through light stimuli. As the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 exhibits strong room&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;pyroelectricity with a large polarization of ~3.23&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 and high voltage responsivity of ~0.96&#8197;m2/C across the UV&#8211;NIR spectral region. Strikingly, the photomodulation of its in&#8208;plane birefringence is established through pyroelectric effect, giving a saturation value of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2 that is among the highest level achieved to date. This study on the birefringence photomodulation of lead&#8208;free hybrid pyroelectric is anticipated to boost future development of new smart optical and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Hydrophosphinylations of Conjugated Enynes, Allenes and Dienes via Synergistic Pd/Co Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, allenes and conjugated dienes with modified masked phosphinylating reagent is established via synergistic Pd/Co catalysis. The stereodivergent protocol is also described to achieve all four stereoisomers of corresponding motifs.







Abstract
Different from the reported work focusing on the construction of single P&#8208; or C&#8208;stereocenter via hydrophosphinylation of unsaturated carbon bonds, the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of allenes, conjugated enynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes is achieved via a designed Pd/Co dual catalysis and newly modified masked phosphinylating reagent. A series of allyl motifs bearing both a tertiary C&#8208; and P&#8208;stereocenter are prepared in generally good yields, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;rr and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. The unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes is established to generate skeletons containing both a P&#8208;stereocenter and a nonadjacent chiral axis. The first stereodivergent hydrophosphinylation reaction is also developed to achieve all four P&#8208;containing stereoisomers. The present protocol features the use of only 3&#8208;minutes reaction time and 0.1&#8201;% catalyst, and with the observation of up to 730 TON. A set of mechanistic studies reveal the necessity and roles of two metal catalysts and corroborate the designed synergistic process.

         <title>Magnetically Induced Amination of Alcohols Using MNi@Cu (M=Fe, Co) Nanoparticles as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co4Ni6@Cu and Fe3Ni7@Cu nanoparticles containing a magnetic core and a catalytic shell have been synthesized and found to be highly active catalysts for amination of primary and secondary alcohols with secondary amines when an alternating magnetic field (AMF) is applied. Several tertiary amines have hence been prepared under argon without hydrogen feed. This process allows to limit degradation reactions of the reagents and of the products and can therefore be used for the synthesis of other thermally sensitive molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis of tertiary amines from alcohols (i.e. heptanol, dodecanol, cyclohexanol, benzylalcohol) and secondary amines (Me2NH (DMA), nPr2NH, nBu2NH) has been achieved in one step using trimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a magnetic core (Co4Ni6 and Fe3Ni7) and a Cu shell as both catalysts and heating agent in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. This methodology limits the redistribution reactions occurring on amines at high temperature leading to both much higher conversion and selectivity in the absence of solvent than usually observed using conventional heating. Moreover, Co4Ni6@Cu NPs were found moisture resistant, thereby allowing for performing the reaction with commercial DMA in water (40&#8201;%&#8201;wt) with again high conversion and selectivity.

         <title>Selective Hydroboration of C&#8722;C Single Bonds without Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds without transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Our strategy surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate scopes, or yields. Mechanistic studies, DFT, and IBO calculations revealed a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and a hydride shift reaction pathway. The key role of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atom of the amide was disclosed.







Abstract
Selective hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds presents a fundamental challenge in the chemical industry. Previously, only catalytic systems utilizing precious metals Ir and Rh, in conjunction with N&#8208; and P&#8208; ligands, could achieve this, ensuring bond cleavage and selectivity. In sharp contrast, we discovered an unprecedented and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds. This methodology is transition&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;free and surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate versatility, or yields. In addition, our system tolerates various functional groups such as Ar&#8722;X (X=halides), heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, amides, nitro, nitriles, and C=C double bonds, which are typically susceptible to hydroboration in the presence of transition metals. As a result, a diverse range of &#947;&#8208;boronated amines with varied structures and functions has been readily obtained. Experimental mechanistic studies, density functional theory (DFT), and intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) calculations unveiled a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and hydride&#8208;shift reaction pathway. The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.

This study examines the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;O&#8208;fused porphyrinoids via an oxidative O&#8208;annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. By synthesizing on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, challenges like overoxidation and instability were addressed.

Abstract
This study investigates the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;O&#8208;fused porphyrinoids employing an oxidative O&#8208;annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. Despite encountering challenges such as overoxidation and instability in conventional solution protocols, successful synthesis was achieved on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy elucidated the preferential formation of pyran moieties via C&#8722;O bond formation and subsequent self&#8208;assembly driven by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Furthermore, the O&#8208;annulation process was found to reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by lifting the HOMO energy level, with the effect rising upon increasing the number of embedded O&#8208;atoms.

&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the synthesis of tetra- and octa-O-fused porphyrinoids employing an oxidative O-annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. Despite encountering challenges such as overoxidation and instability in conventional solution protocols, successful synthesis was achieved on Au(111) surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and non-contact atomic force microscopy elucidated the preferential formation of pyran moieties via C&#8722;O bond formation and subsequent self-assembly driven by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Furthermore, the O-annulation process was found to reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by lifting the HOMO energy level, with the effect rising upon increasing the number of embedded O-atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Wettability of C1N1 (Sub)Nanopores: Implications for Porous Carbonaceous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores of size below a few nanometers. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we unravel that only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1 despite their hydrophilic character. In contrast, water enters similar pores of hydrophobic pure carbon material.







Abstract
Understanding how water interacts with nanopores of carbonaceous electrodes is crucial for energy storage and conversion applications. A high surface area of carbonaceous materials does not necessarily need to translate to a high electrolyte&#8208;solid interface area. Herein, we study the interaction of water with nanoporous C1N1 materials to explain their very low specific capacitance in aqueous electrolytes despite their high surface area. Water was used to probe chemical environments, provided by pores of different sizes, in 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR experiments. We observe that regardless of their high hydrophilicity, only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1, in contrast to a reference pure carbon material with a similar pore structure. The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores below a few nanometers. Calorimetric and sorption experiments demonstrated strong water adsorption on the C1N1 surface, which restricts water mobility across the interface and impedes its penetration into the nanopores.

         <title>Four&#8208;State Electrochromism in Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208; terephthalaldehyde&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While several electrochromic COFs (denoted as ecCOFs) have been reported to date, a closer survey suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three&#8208;state electrochromism [Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606&#8211;1261]. Herein, we report four&#8208;state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism in tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208;terephthalaldehyde&#8208;based COF constructed through the metal&#8208;catalyst free Schiff base approach.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of massive interest due to their potential application spanning diverse fields such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, drug delivery systems, sensing, and organic electronics. In view of their application&#8208;oriented quest, the field of electrochromism marked a significant stride with the reporting of the first electrochromic COF in 2019 [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 19831&#8211;19838]. Since then, new and novel COF structures with electrochromic features (denoted as ecCOFs) have been searched continuously. Yet, only a handful of ecCOFs have been constructed to date. A closer look at these reports suggests that multielectrochromism (showing at least three redox color states) in a COF assembly has only been achieved once, manifested through three&#8208;state electrochromism [Angew. Chem. 2021, 133, 12606&#8211;1261]. Herein, we report four&#8208;state electrochromism in tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine&#8208;terephthalaldehyde (TAPA&#8208;PDA)&#8208;based COF constructed through the metal&#8208;catalyst free Schiff base approach. The four&#8208;state (orange, pear, green, and cyan) electrochromism demonstrated by the TAPA&#8208;PDA ecCOF opens several futuristic avenues for ecCOF&#8242;s end use in flip&#8208;flop logic gates, intelligent windows, decorative displays, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

         <title>Peptide Degrader&#8208;Based Targeting of METTL3/14 Improves Immunotherapy Response in Cutaneous Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study unveils METTL3&#8217;s oncogenic role in melanoma. RM3, a designed peptide inhibitor disrupting METTL3/14 complex, induces proteasomal degradation via STUB1. RM3 reduces melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, RM3 elicits significantly enhanced tumor response in vivo, with a favorable safety profile.







Abstract
METTL3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, although its oncogenic functions in melanoma development and potential for therapeutic targeting drug have not been fully explored. In this study, we define the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma development and progression. Building on this insight, we examine our recently designed peptide inhibitor RM3, which targets the binding interface of METTL3/14 complex for disruption and subsequent ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase STUB1. RM3 treatment reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno&#8208;related genes following RM3&#8208;mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of RM3 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase RM3, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.

         <title>Enhanced UV Light Responsivity in &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskites Realized by Pressure&#8208;induced Ultrafast Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential in photovoltaic, light&#8208;emitting, and photodetection applications. Nevertheless, their enlarged interlayer spacing restricts longitudinal carrier transport, thereby limiting its potential applications. While &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites provide a prospective solution with their compact interlayer spacing, their inherent structure, characterized by octahedra tilting, indirectly hinders carrier transport due to the generation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) caused by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Here, we adeptly regulate the photoluminescence (PL) from STEs to free excitons (FEs) emission within the 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented (API)PbBr4 single crystal through structure optimization under pressure treatment. Besides, we observed anisotropic FE transport with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. The exciton mobility reaches a peak of 93.6 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 2.7 GPa, a value comparable to those of their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts, which is attributed to a reduction in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Additionally, this ultrafast exciton transport significantly enhances UV light responsivity, exhibiting an increase of approximately 5000 times at 2.7 GPa in comparison to ambient conditions. These findings highlight the prospective application of 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices through intrinsic structural modulation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The chirality of metal&#8208;organic cages holds enormous potential for novel applications in diverse fields, while it is relatively rare to employ such asymmetric units for the construction of noncentrosymmetric materials.

         <title>Carbonylation Reactions at Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with an Adjacent Heteroatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the most recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving heteroatom adjacent carbon radicals, specifically including the heteroatoms oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The reaction mechanisms are also described in detail.







Abstract
Heteroatoms are essential to living organisms and present in almost all molecules with medicinal usage. The catalytic functionalization at the carbon&#8208;centered radical with an adjacent heteroatom provides an effective way to value added moiety while retaining the unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of heteroatoms, which can promote the development of pharmaceutical and fine chemical production. Carbonylative transformation was discovered nearly a century ago which is an efficient method for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules with potent applications in both industry and academia. Despite numerous advances in new reaction development, carbonylative transformation involving adjacent heteroatom carbon radical remain a subject that deserves to be discussed. In this minireview, we systematically summarized and discussed the recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving carbon&#8208;centered radicals with an adjacent heteroatom, including oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The related reaction mechanism was also discussed.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Induces Halogen/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (XAT/HAT) for Allylic C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective allylic C&#8722;H amination has been established via lead halide perovskite nanocrystals as the photocatalyst. The CsPbBr3 catalyst exhibits remarkable halogen vacancies that exploit halogenated solvents as mild oxidants for C&#8722;H amination. A cooperative halogen/hydrogen atom transfer reaction mechanism has been interrogated and concludes the observed high selectivity and broad scope of such allylic C&#8722;H functionalization products, ranging from natural products to drug derivatives.







Abstract
Allylic C&#8722;H amination has emerged as a powerful tool to construct allylamines, common motifs in molecular therapeutics. Such reaction implies an oxidative path for C&#8722;H activation but furnishes reductive amines, inferring mild oxidants&#8217; inactivity for C&#8722;H oxidation but strong oxidants&#8217; detriment to products. Herein we report a heterogeneous catalytic approach that manipulates halogen&#8208;vacancies of perovskite photocatalyst and exploits halogenated&#8208;solvents (i.e. CH2Cl2, CH2Br2) as mild oxidants for selective C&#8722;H allyl amination with 19,376&#8197;turnovers. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals induce cooperative hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT, C&#8722;H oxidation, and halogen&#8208;vacancy CsPbBr3&#8722;x formation) and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (XAT, CsPbBr3&#8722;x&#8208;induced solvent reduction) under a radical chain mechanism. Terminal/internal olefins are amenable to forge aromatic/aliphatic, cyclic/acyclic, secondary/tertiary allylamines (70&#8197;examples), including drugs or their derivatives.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Doping in Robust Open&#8208;Shell Ladder&#8208;Type Oligoaniline Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;doping mechanism is introduced in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. This mechanism, facilitated by resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer, enables efficient self&#8208;doping of the organic electronic compound, resulting in a durable conductive material without the need for an external dopant. The findings open new possibilities for creating organic conductors that are both high&#8208;performing and long&#8208;lasting.







Abstract
A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer and electronic doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material&#8216;s electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Optical Control of AMPA Glutamate Receptors with a Photoswitchable Tethered Antagonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMPA receptors are central to excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain but difficult to control with sufficient precision. We developed MP&#8208;GluAblock, a cell specific light&#8208;controllable AMPAR blocker that consists of a photo&#8208;switchable compound (P) that is targeted to specific cells via an expressed membrane&#8208;anchor protein (M). Our approach could be used to dissect AMPAR signaling with unprecedented cellular and spatiotemporal specificity.







Abstract
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the main drivers of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain, central to synaptic plasticity, and are key drug targets. However, AMPARs are expressed in virtually every neuron in the central nervous system and are activated with complex temporal dynamics, making it difficult to determine their functional roles with sufficient precision. Here we describe a cell specific, light&#8208;controllable competitive antagonist for the AMPA receptor called MP&#8208;GluAblock that combines the temporal precision of a photo&#8208;switchable ligand with the spatial and cellular specificity of a genetically&#8208;encoded membrane&#8208;anchor protein. This tool could pave the way for controlling endogenous AMPARs in neural circuits with cellular, spatial, and temporal specificity.

         <title>K+&#8208;Mediated vs Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;Didehydrotribenzo[8]annulene (TribenzoCOTyne): Stereodivergent Access to (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208; and (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;Fragments of Cubic Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkable properties have been predicted for cubic graphite, a hypothetical 3D carbon allotrope composed of carbon cages (C48). A sixty carbons fragment of cubic graphite, benzofused (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208;tris(tribenzo[8]annulene) (TTBA), was now assembled by K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization of tribenzoCOTyne, that contains 36&#8197;carbon atoms properly arranged in a well&#8208;defined cubic graphite cage (C48).







Abstract
A remarkable stereodivergent cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;didehydrotribenzo[8]annulene (tribenzoCOTyne) to the corresponding (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208; and (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;benzofused derivatives has been developed by controlling the reaction conditions.

         <title>Lantern&#8208;Shaped Structure Induced by Racemic Ligands in Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Metal Halide with Near 100&#8201;% Quantum Yield and Multiple&#8208;Stimulus Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing the synergistic effect of racemic ligands, a novel red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide with lantern&#8208;shaped hybrid structures was developed, exhibiting nearly 100&#8201;% quantum yield and unique stimulus&#8208;responsive color switching under the dual stimulation of heat and mechanical force.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their excellent luminescent properties and tunable emission wavelengths. However, the development of efficient red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting OIMHs remains a significant challenge. This work reports three Mn&#8208;based OIMHs derived from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrobromide: racemic one (Rac&#8208;TBM) and chiral ones (R&#8208;TBM and S&#8208;TBM). As a result of the synergism of chiral organic ligands inducing a unique lantern&#8208;shaped hybrid structure containing both tetrahedra and octahedra, Rac&#8208;TBM exhibits red&#8208;light emission with near&#8208;unity luminescence quantum yield. In comparison, the chiral counterparts R/S&#8208;TBM display strong green emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum value up to &#177;2.5&#215;10&#8722;2. Interestingly, a mixture of R&#8208; and S&#8208;TBM can transform into Rac&#8208;TBM, successfully achieving a sensitive and reversible switch between red light of octahedra and green light of tetrahedra under external stimuli. The outstanding luminescent properties allow Rac&#8208;TBM to be utilized not only for X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a detection limit down to 46.29&#8197;nGys&#8722;1, but also for advanced information encryption systems to achieve leak&#8208;proof decryption.

         <title>Generation of Triplet States by Host&#8208;Stabilized Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for the Construction of Efficient Supramolecular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation efficiency and lifetime of triplet state can be clearly promoted by the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation, contributing to the fabrication of highly efficient photocatalytic system. The supramolecular photocatalyst exhibits excellent performance in catalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. It shows high catalytic performance in the photodegradation of lignin owing to the ultra&#8208;stable host&#8211;guest complexation.







Abstract
Promoting the generation of triplet states is essential for developing efficient photocatalytic systems. This research presents a novel approach of host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation via the combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent methods. The designed building block, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4(1,4)&#8208;dibenzene cyclohexaphane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;phenylpyridinium) chloride, features inherently stable through&#8208;space conjugation. When this block forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex with cucurbit[8]uril, the through&#8208;space conjugation is further stabilized within the confined cavity. Both the generation and lifetime of triplet state are significantly increased, resulting from the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation. Additionally, the ultrahigh binding constant of 6.58&#215;1014&#8197;M&#8722;1 ensures the persistence of host&#8208;stabilization effect. As a result, the host&#8211;guest complex acts as a highly efficient catalyst in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. In the photodegradation of lignin, a complex natural product, the host&#8211;guest complex also exhibits high efficiency, demonstrating its robustness. This line of research is anticipated to enrich the toolbox of supramolecular photochemistry and provide a strategy for fabricating efficient supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Glycine from Methanol and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a novel photocatalytic system for the synthesis of glycine directly from methanol and nitrate. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles show a high glycine photosynthesis rate under mild conditions. The success of this work provides a sustainable pathway for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste.







Abstract
Photocatalytic utilization of methanol and nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources for the direct synthesis of amino acids could provide a sustainable way for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste. In this study, we develop an efficient photochemical method to synthesize glycine directly from methanol and nitrate, which cascades the C&#8722;C coupling to form glycol, nitrate reduction to NH3, and finally C&#8722;N coupling to generate glycine. Interestingly, the involved photocatalytic tandem reactions show a synergistic effect, in which the presence of nitrate is the dominant factor to enable the overall reaction and reach high synthetic efficiency. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles are confirmed as a feasible and efficient catalyst system for the photosynthesis of glycine with a remarkable glycine photosynthesis rate of 870&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under optimal conditions. This work establishes a novel catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from methanol and nitrate under mild conditions. These results also allow us to further suppose the formation pathways of amino acids on the primitive earth, as an extension to proposals based on the Miller&#8208;Urey experiments.

         <title>Construction of Liposome&#8208;Based Extracellular Artificial Organelles on Individual Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Individual cells are coated with multilayered functional liposomes, serving as extracellular artificial organelles, or exorganelles, and conferring extrinsic capacity on the cells. The method is highly cytocompatible, interfacing with living cells, and chemically flexible in the lipid composition and cargo of the exorganelles. Cells are empowered with various functions, beyond their innate ones, such as multienzymatic catalysis, magnetizability, stimuli&#8208;responsive chemical release, and cell modification.







Abstract
Integration of living cells with extrinsic functional entities gives rise to bioaugmented nanobiohybrids, which hold tremendous potential across diverse fields such as cell therapy, biocatalysis, and cell robotics. This study presents a biocompatible method for incorporating multilayered functional liposomes onto the cell surface, creating extracellular artificial organelles or exorganelles. The introduction of various extrinsic functionalities to cells is achieved without comprising their viabilities. The integration of extrinsic enzymatic reactions is exemplified through the cascade reaction involving glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, our protocol offers the design flexibility to customize liposome compositions, thereby providing effective cell modification. The versatility of the liposome&#8208;based exorganelle approach establishes an advanced chemical tool, empowering cells with novel functionalities that surpass or are complementary to their innate capabilities.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Highly Specific Bioorthogonal Catalysis Inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a copper center and specific substrate binding domain, could perform highly&#8208;specific abiotic transformation inside cells, particularly in a gain&#8208;of&#8208;functions. Importantly, Cu&#8208;MIEs exclusively catalyze target substrates and retain its superb performance even in the presence of copper&#8208;poisoning molecules like glutathione (GSH).







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu&#8208;MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)&#8208;rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu&#8208;MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates. This system was applied to a thyroid hormone (T3)&#8208;responsive gene switch model, inducing firefly luciferase expression by T3 in cells. This approach verifies that MIEs effectively rescue DmProc&#8208;bearing T3 prodrugs and seamlessly integrating themself into cellular biocatalytic networks.

         <title>Suspension Bead Loading (SBL): An Economical Protein Delivery Platform to Study URM1&#8217;s Behavior in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a &#8220;Suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL) approach that serves as a general and economical delivery method to address fundamental biological questions. We applied SBL to investigate the cellular behavior of synthetic Ubiquitin related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1) under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Uniquely modified synthetic proteins are difficult to produce in large quantities, which could limit their use in various in vitro settings and in cellular studies. In this study, we developed a method named &#8220;suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL), to deliver protein molecules into suspended living cells using glass beads, which significantly reduces the amount of protein required for effective delivery. We investigated the delivery efficiency of functionally different proteins and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of our method and the chemical and functional integrity of the delivered protein. We utilized SBL to address questions related to ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1). Employing minimal protein quantities, SBL has enabled us to study its behavior within live cells under different redox conditions, including subcellular localization and conjugation patterns. We demonstrate that oxidative stress alters both the localization and conjugation pattern of URM1 in cells, highlighting its possible role in cellular response to such extreme conditions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Potassium Decahydrido&#8208;Monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;Decaborate Imidazole Complex Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A newly synthesized complex, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, with the dihydrogen bond structural features, exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude greater than that of KCB9H10 and the highest ionic conductivity reported to date for hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors. This work offers a promising strategy for synthesizing solid K&#8208;ion conductors with enhanced conductivity.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries have caught increasing interest owing to their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high energy/power density. However, their development is generally constrained by the lack of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a new complex KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, synthesized by grinding and heating the mixture of potassium decahydrido&#8208;monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;decaborate (KCB9H10) and imidazole (C3H4N2) under mild conditions, to achieve the K&#8208;ion superionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The crystal structure was revealed as an orthorhombic lattice with the space group of Pna21 by FOX software. The diffusion properties for K+ in the crystal structure were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI&#8208;NEB) method. KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude higher than that of KCB9H10. This ionic conductivity is also the highest value of hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors reported. Moreover, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 demonstrated a K+ transference number of 0.96, an electrochemical stability window of 1.2 to 3.2&#8197;V vs. K/K+, and good stability against the K metal coated by a layer of potassium imidazolate (KIm). These great performances make KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 a promising K&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte.

         <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Heteroatom&#8208;Decorated Carbon Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F, N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is selected as the model system to explore the activity origin of carbon towards the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Enriched electrons on O* intermediate can promote the transition from O* to OOH* during OER, fundamentally addressing the rate&#8208;limiting step issue of OOH* generation in carbon materials.







Abstract
Chemical modification via functional dopants in carbon materials holds great promise for elevating catalytic activity and stability. To gain comprehensive insights into the pivotal mechanisms and establish structure&#8208;performance relationships, especially concerning the roles of dopants, remains a pressing need. Herein, we employ computational simulations to unravel the catalytic function of heteroatoms in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), focusing on a physical model of high&#8208;electronegative F and N co&#8208;doped carbon matrix. Theoretical and experimental findings elucidate that the enhanced activity originates from the F and pyridinic&#8208;N (Py&#8722;N) species that achieve carbon activation. This activated carbon significantly lowers the conversion energy barrier from O* to OOH*, shifts the potential&#8208;limiting step from OOH* formation to O* generation, and ultimately optimizes the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;limiting step. This wok elucidates that the critical role of heteroatoms in catalyzing the reaction and unlocks the potential of carbon materials for acidic OER.

Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all&#8208;perovskite tandems.

Mixed tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells can reach band gaps as low as 1.2&#8197;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface, have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81&#8201;% and efficiencies of up to 23.8&#8201;%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8197;h of shelf storage.

&lt;p&gt;Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long-term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all-perovskite tandems.

         <title>Construction of Highly Porous and Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Capacity Clean Energy Gas Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein proposed and demonstrated a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target a highly porous and robust HOF material (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a), exhibiting one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas for extraordinary high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage capacities.







Abstract
Development of highly porous and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage remains a grand challenge due to the fragile nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target highly porous and robust HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a) for extraordinary CH4 and H2 storage. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a features a minimized twofold interpenetration with double&#8208;walled structure, in which multiple supramolecular interactions are existed between the interpenetrated walls. This structural configuration can notably enhance the framework robustness while maintaining its high porosity, affording one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas of 3102&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1976&#8197;m2&#8201;cm&#8722;3 among the reported HOFs so far. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a thus exhibits an extremely high volumetric H2 uptake of 43.6&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar and working capacity of 41.3&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 under combined swing conditions (77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar&#8594;160&#8197;K/5&#8197;bar), and also impressive methane storage performance with a 5&#8211;100&#8197;bar working capacity of 187 (or 159) cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 270&#8197;K (or 296&#8197;K), outperforming most of the reported porous organic materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on CH4&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a reveal that abundant supramolecular binding sites combined with ultrahigh porosities account for its high CH4 storage capacities. Combined with high stability, super&#8208;hydrophobicity, and easy recovery, ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a is placed among the most promising materials for H2 and CH4 storage applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Luminophore Molecular Engineering for Rapidly Phototunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering strategy for rapidly photoregulatable solid&#8208;state luminescence was developed. The key factors of the strategy emphasize the enhanced conformational freedom by the isolated arrangement of ionic persulfurated arenes assisted by weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, as well as the facilitated photoexcitation&#8208;induced conformational change of persulfurated arenes.







Abstract
Smart materials enabling emission intensity or wavelength tuning by light stimulus have attracted attention in cutting&#8208;edge fields. However, due to the general limitation of the dense molecular stacking (in solid states, especially in crystals) on photoresponsivity, constructing rapidly phototunable solid&#8208;state luminescent systems remains challenging. Herein, we present a new luminophore that serves as both a photoresponsive and a luminous group with enhanced conformational freedom to attain this goal, namely, relying on photoexcitation&#8208;induced molecular conformational change of an ionized persulfurated arene based on weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Together with the phosphorescence characteristic of the molecule itself, rapidly enhanced phosphorescence upon irradiation can be observed in a series of phase states, like solution state, crystal, and amorphous state, especially with a high photoresponsive rate of 0.033&#8197;s&#8722;1 in crystal state that is superior to the relevant reported cases. Moreover, a rapidly phototunable afterglow effect is achieved by extending this molecule into some polymer&#8208;based doping systems, endowing the system with unique dynamic imaging and fast photopatterning capabilities. This single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering and underlying mechanism have implications for building other condensed functional materials, principally for those with stimuli responses in solid states.

         <title>A Supramolecular&#8208;Nanocage&#8208;Based Framework Stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Interactions with Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework was firstly reported, which can serve as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The H2 evolution rate reaches as high as 524012&#8197;&#956;mol/gPt/h.







Abstract
&#960; frameworks, defined as a type of porous supramolecular materials weaved from conjugated molecular units by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, provide a new direction in photocatalysis. However, such examples are rarely reported. Herein, we report a supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework constructed from a photoactive Cu(I) complex unit. Structurally, 24 Cu(I) complex units stack together through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, forming a truncated octahedral nanocage with sodalite topology. The inner diameter of the nanocage is 2.8&#8197;nm. By sharing four open faces, each nanocage connects with four equivalent ones, forming a 3D porous &#960; framework (&#960;&#8208;2). &#960;&#8208;2 shows good thermal and chemical stability, which can adsorb CO2, iodine, and methyl orange molecules. More importantly, &#960;&#8208;2 can serve as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. With ultrafine Pt subnanometer particles (0.9&#177;0.1&#8197;nm) incorporated into the nanocages as a co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches a record&#8208;high value of 524012&#8197;&#956;mol/gPt/h in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the ultrafine size of the Pt particles, as well as the fast electron transfer from &#960;&#8208;2 to the highly active Pt upon illumination. &#960;&#8208;2 represents the unique stable supramolecular&#8208;cage&#8208;based &#960; framework with excellent photocatalytic activity.

         <title>In situ Cyclization of Aromatic Thioethers in Emissive Materials to Generate Phosphorescent Dibenzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced cyclization of thioethers was investigated in detail. The obtained phosphorescent dibenzothiophenes exhibit remarkable luminescence in frozen matrices with ultralong lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity. Furthermore, inducing the reaction in situ in polymer films and within 3D&#8208;printed objects allows for information storage in easily processable materials via ultralong room temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
In this contribution, we explored the photocyclization of thioethers to highly substituted dibenzothiophenes (DBT) using solely UV&#8208;light without any need for additives. This cost&#8208;effective, robust and environmentally friendly approach yielded phosphorescent compounds, which were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photophysical methods. The resulting DBTs feature ultralong photoluminescence lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity in frozen glassy matrices. The reaction mechanism was elucidated in detail through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental results, providing evidence that triplet states are involved in the cyclization process. Additionally, the photoreaction can also be induced within materials. For this purpose, the precursors were integrated into polymer films or polymer resins suitable for 3D printing. Irradiation of these polymeric objects allows motifs with ultralong phosphorescence to be irreversibly inscribed through the proceeding photocyclization. The in situ photogeneration of DBTs from aromatic thioethers overcomes the observed incompatibilities regarding solubility in polymer resins for 3D printing.

     alt="In situ Cyclization of Aromatic Thioethers in Emissive Materials to Generate Phosphorescent Dibenzothiophenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photoinduced cyclization of thioethers was investigated in detail. The obtained phosphorescent dibenzothiophenes exhibit remarkable luminescence in frozen matrices with ultralong lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity. Furthermore, inducing the reaction &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; in polymer films and within 3D-printed objects allows for information storage in easily processable materials &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; ultralong room temperature phosphorescence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this contribution, we explored the photocyclization of thioethers to highly substituted dibenzothiophenes (DBT) using solely UV-light without any need for additives. This cost-effective, robust and environmentally friendly approach yielded phosphorescent compounds, which were characterized by X-ray crystallography and state-of-the-art photophysical methods. The resulting DBTs feature ultralong photoluminescence lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity in frozen glassy matrices. The reaction mechanism was elucidated in detail through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental results, providing evidence that triplet states are involved in the cyclization process. Additionally, the photoreaction can also be induced within materials. For this purpose, the precursors were integrated into polymer films or polymer resins suitable for 3D printing. Irradiation of these polymeric objects allows motifs with ultralong phosphorescence to be irreversibly inscribed through the proceeding photocyclization. The &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; photogeneration of DBTs from aromatic thioethers overcomes the observed incompatibilities regarding solubility in polymer resins for 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration and Stabilizing Crystal&#8208;Phase in Halide Perovskite via Directly Incorporated Fluoride Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity was directly inserted in lead halide perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand, which strongly suppressed ion migration and stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, leading to an advantageous device performance and operational stability.







Abstract
Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity has been under intensive investigation in perovskite solar cells due to its remarkable defect suppression and great improvement of device performance. Nevertheless, these researches only focus on the surface, grain boundaries, or interface modification, the direct insertion of F&#8722; into the crystal lattice of regular lead halide perovskite films is still unrevealed. Herein, F&#8722; was successfully incorporated into the perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand. The strong electronegativity of F&#8722; can strongly increase the binding energy of all the ions in CsPbI2Br and inhibit their defect formations. A trace amount of F&#8722; incorporation not only enhanced the optoelectronic properties but also effectively mitigated the ion migration and phase separation simultaneously. The photovoltaic performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells were significantly improved with a champion efficiency of 17.78&#8201;% (38.01&#8201;%) under AM 1.5G (1000 lux indoor light). Moreover, F&#8722; can also be directly inserted into the hybrid perovskite lattice and greatly stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, enabling efficient fully MA&#8208;free FAPbI3 devices with 25.10&#8201;% efficiency. Our strategy sheds light on F&#8208;containing perovskites and provides a promising way to tackle ion migration and stabilize the crystal phase in halide perovskites.

         <title>Isomeric Dimer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells with over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomer dimer acceptors were designed and synthesized, D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced planarity, elevated LUMO energy, more ordered stacking, and desirable phase separation. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh achieved a higher efficiency of 19.05&#8201;% and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
The strategy of isomerization is known for its simple yet effective role in optimizing molecular configuration and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the impact of isomerization on the design of dimer acceptors has been rarely investigated, and the relationship between the chemical structure and optoelectronic property remains unclear. In this study, we designed and synthesized two dimer acceptor isomers named D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. Compared to D&#8208;TN, D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced backbone planarity, elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, and more ordered molecular stacking. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh achieved a PCE of 19.05&#8201;%, higher than that (PCE=18.42&#8201;%) of the device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TN. Large&#8208;area PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh devices (1&#8197;cm2) yielded a PCE of 18.00&#8201;%. More importantly, the extrapolated T80 lifetime of the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh device is over 2800&#8197;h with MPP tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. These results suggest that isomerization strategy is an effective way to optimize the molecular configuration of dimer acceptors for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight has long been the primary energy source for our planet. This minireview highlights its importance and investigates the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. It examines fundamental processes, including the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, the review assesses various carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based complexes photocatalysts and their roles in driving chemical reactions. It further provides insights into possible evolutionary pathways for Earth, emphasizing the pivotal influence of carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based photocatalysts in the development of Earth.







Abstract
Sunlight has long served as primary energy source on our planet, shaping the behavior of living organisms. Extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the evolutionary pathways involved. When the formation of Earth atmosphere, it primarily consisted of small gas molecules, which are considered crucial for the emergence of life. Recent demonstrations have shown that these molecules can also be transformed into semiconductors, with the potential to harness solar energy and catalyze chemical reactions as photocatalysts. Building upon this research, this minireview focuses on the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. Initially, it examines key reactions, such as the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, various C&#8722;N complexes in photocatalysts are explored, showcasing their roles in catalyzing chemical reactions. The conclusion and outlook provide a potential pathway for the evolution of Earth, shedding light on the significance of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in development of Earth.

         <title>Abiotic Foldamer Quaternary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hydrogen bond donors at precise locations at the periphery of a stable aromatic foldamer helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix tertiary fold led to its aggregation in chloroform to produce genuine discrete abiotic quaternary structures in which the tertiary folds are preserved. The quaternary structures were assigned to C3&#8208;symmetrical trimer corresponding to the initial design, and to an unexpected hydrated C2&#8208;symmetrical dimer.







Abstract
Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.

         <title>Multiple Structural and Phase Transformations of MOF and Selective Hydrocarbon Gas Separation in its Amorphous, Glass Phase States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiple structure transformation and phase evolution within MOF provide a vivid example showing the diverse MOF dynamic chemistry under both room and high temperature. The generated disordered hierarchical pores in amorphous and glassy MOFs different to the crystalline precursor, contributes to efficient separation of either C2H2/C2H4 or C3H6/C3H8 gases mixture for the first time in breakthrough experiments.

The first wide&#8208;view image of multiple structural and phase transformations for MOFs, ranging from crystal state transformations to the extreme limit approaching liquid/glass phase, was presented. The process involves i) an initial crystalline transformation from square&#8208;layer framework [Co2(pybz)2(CH3COO)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (Co2) to a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated and ordered vacancies contained framework [Co(pybz)2(CH3OH)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH (CoM) due to in situ disassemble&#8208;reassemble, ii) thermal induced departure of a pair of cis&#8208;form coordinated methanol in CoM leads to amorphous framework a&#8208;dCoM, iii) glass transition to super&#8208;cooled liquid scl&#8208;dCoM, iv) obtaining MOF glass g&#8208;dCoM upon quenching the super&#8208;cooled liquid, and v) re&#8208;crystallization of super&#8208;cooled liquid generates 6&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia&#8208;net framework [Co(pybz)2]6n (rec&#8208;dCoM) under further heating. The access to glass from CoM, provides a new self&#8208;perturbation strategy to create MOF glasses without melting. The wider pore size distribution in amorphous/glassy MOFs than crystalline precursor achieved the first time selective hydrocarbon gas separation by breakthrough experiments, which bring efficient separation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;99&#8197;C2H2/C2H4 by either a&#8208;dCoM or g&#8208;dCoM and produce polymer grade C2H4 with purity&#8805;99.5&#8201;% after a single adsorption process. Furthermore, the mixture of 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;C3H6/C3H8 can be separated by a&#8208;dCoM.

         <title>Rigid Ligand Confined Synthesis of Carbon Supported Dimeric Fe Sites with High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared by a rigid ligand confinement strategy, and shows excellent performance for oxygen reduction reaction. The active site of Fe dimers, which favors the adsorption of OOH* with Yeager&#8208;type binding, is advantageous over single&#8208;atom site in promoting reaction process. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery achieves small charge/discharge voltage gaps during charge/discharge test.







Abstract
Dimeric metal sites (DiMSs) in carbon&#8208;based single atom catalysts (SACs) offer distinct advantages in optimizing the adsorption energies of the catalytic intermediates and reaction pathways over single atom sites, which inspires the investigations on the rational design of DiMSs&#8208;based SACs and the accurate discernment of catalytic mechanisms. Here, dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared using the precursor of metal&#8208;organic complex with a controlled structure, and the rigid ligand confinement secures the preservation of dimeric Fe sites during the thermal treatment. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.917&#8197;V, and excellent durability with negligible activity decay. Theoretical studies reveal that the dimeric Fe sites have an optimal adsorption of OOH* with the Yeager&#8208;type binding, illustrating the advantages of DiMSs over SAs in catalyzing ORR. The rechargeable aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled using DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based air cathodes achieve small voltage gaps after long term charge/discharge test, showing great promises for practical applications. This synthetic strategy serves a novel platform to produce a scope of catalysts incorporating multimeric metal sites, and studies on the catalytic mechanism lay the foundation for establishing cooperative effect for multidentate adsorption reactions.

         <title>Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;Small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique gapped and rotated grain boundary is discovered in Au78(TBBT)40, as the first hybrid boundary model in the gold nanoclusters. Au78(TBBT)40 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO compared to a series of face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured nanoparticles with larger or smaller sizes, demonstrating the effectiveness of manipulating GBs to fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance of nanoclusters.







Abstract
Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenylthiolate) with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5&#8197;nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibited higher catalytic activity in the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity was explained through density functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, which highlight the impact of GBs and point defects on the surface properties of metal nanoclusters in balancing intermediate adsorption and product desorption.

         <title>Reviving Multivalent&#8208;Metal Anodes in Simple Salt Electrolytes via Component Modifier Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically impervious passivating film on multivalent&#8208;metal anodes seriously impairs their cycling efficiencies and lifespan. To address this issue, this work proposes the structure design principle of component modifiers via balancing the corrosion and passivation reactions toward metal&#8208;anodes, achieving exceptional metal electro&#8208;plating/stripping cycling stability.







Abstract
Using combinatory electrolyte blends represents an imperative avenue to achieve good magnesium (Mg)&#8208;metal anode compatibility and commercial feasibility in fields of promising rechargeable Mg batteries. However, fundamental challenges of how to manipulate component modifier reactivity on molecule level still remain to be solved. Here, molecular structure design concepts towards seeking bromophenyl complex&#8208;based component modifiers has been proposed according to implications of electron&#8208;donating and/or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on Br&#8722;C bond dissociation reactivity. Exceptional Mg electro&#8208;plating/stripping properties (a stable cycle life of 250&#8197;days in Mg//Cu asymmetric cells) have been firstly achieved in a simple salt electrolyte with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylmethanamine (BPDMA) as optimal component modifier. Comprehensive analyses disclose the unique electrochemically&#8208;active Br&#8208;containing ion&#8208;pairs formation, such as [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)Br&#8722;]2+ and [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)(Br&#8722;)(G2)2]2+, which results in the much thinner Br&#8722; containing and organic&#8211;inorganic mixed interphases on Mg&#8208;metal anodes. Furthermore, conventional MgSO4&#8208;based electrolytes and even calcium (Ca)&#8208;ion electrolytes can also be revived by similar strategy, demonstrating its generality and superiority.

         <title>Doping In Vivo Alkylation in E. coli by Introducing the Direct Sulfurylation Pathway of S. cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are emerging enzymes for selective biocatalytic alkylation. Introduction of the direct sulfurylation pathway from S. cerevisiae improved methylation up to 17&#8208;fold, allowing straight&#8208;forward isolation of the methylated products. It also enabled in vivo alkylation of non&#8208;physiological substrates in E. coli by boosting the methionine (analogue) availability using off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf thiols as alkyl donor.







Abstract
Methylation and alkylation are important techniques used for the synthesis and derivatisation of small molecules and natural products. Application of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) in biotechnological hosts such as Escherichia coli lowers the environmental impact of alkylation compared to chemical synthesis and facilitates regio&#8208; and chemoselective alkyl chain transfer. Here, we address the limiting factor for SAM synthesis, methionine supply, to accelerate in vivo methylation activity. Introduction of the direct sulfurylation pathway, consisting of O&#8208;acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase (ScOAHS) and O&#8208;acetyltransferase (ScMET2), from S. cerevisiae into E. coli and supplementation with methanethiol or the corresponding disulfide improves atom&#8208;economic methylation activity in three different MT reactions. Up to 17&#8208;fold increase of conversion compared to the sole expression of the MT and incorporation of up to 79&#8201;% of the thiol compound added were achieved. Promiscuity of ScOAHS allowed in vivo production of methionine analogues from organic thiols. Further co&#8208;overproduction of a methionine adenosyltransferase yielded SAM analogues which were further transferred by MTs onto different substrates. For methylation of non&#8208;physiological substrates, conversion rates up to 73&#8201;% were achieved, with an isolated yield of 41&#8201;% for N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;aminonitrophenol. The here described technique enables E. coli to become a biotechnological host for improved methylation and selective alkylation reactions.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Enhanced by a Non&#8208;Emissive Dual Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722; complex enhances the ECL detection system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) by up to an order of magnitude without interference from the inherent ECL of previously reported Ir(III) enhancers. In addition to its electrocatalysis of TPrA oxidation and efficient chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminophore, the complex increases the thickness of the ECL layer by extending diffusion of the intermediates from the electrode.







Abstract
A sulfonated tris(1&#8208;phenylpyrazolato)iridium(III) complex ([Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722;) serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept non&#8208;emissive enhancer of the widely used ECL detection system of tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) co&#8208;reactant, acting through electrocatalysis of TPrA oxidation and efficient chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminophore. Using self&#8208;interference ECL spectroscopy, we show that the enhancer extends diffusion of the required electrogenerated precursors from the electrode surface. Previously reported enhancement through these pathways has been confounded by the inherent ECL of the enhancer, but the increase in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ ECL intensity using [Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722; was obtained without its concomitant emission. The most prominent enhancement (11&#8208;fold) occurred at low potentials associated with the &#8216;indirect&#8217; co&#8208;reactant ECL pathway, which translated to between 2&#8208; and 6&#8208;fold enhancement when the luminophore was immobilised on microbeads as a general model for enhanced ECL assays.

         <title>C60 Fullerene&#8208;Induced Reduction of Metal Ions: Synthesis of C60&#8208;Metal Cluster Heterostructures with High Electrocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, fullerene C60 induces spontaneous reduction of metal ions and deposition of metal clusters, achieving the synthesis of fullerene&#8208;supported metal cluster catalysts through a pretreatment&#8208;free and reductant&#8208;free process. The strong multiple anchoring points on the surface of C60 promote the stabilization and small size distribution of metal clusters.







Abstract
Metal clusters, due to their small dimensions, contain a high proportion of surface atoms, thus possessing a significantly improved catalytic activity compared with their bulk counterparts and nanoparticles. Defective and modified carbon supports are effective in stabilizing metal clusters, however, the synthesis of isolated metal clusters still requires multiple steps and harsh conditions. Herein, we develop a C60 fullerene&#8208;driven spontaneous metal deposition process, where C60 serves as both a reductant and an anchor, to achieve uniform metal (Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, Au and Ru) clusters without the need for any defects or functional groups on C60. Density functional theory calculations reveal that C60 possesses multiple strong metal adsorption sites, which favors stable and uniform deposition of metal atoms. In addition, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of C60, the electronic structures of metal clusters are effectively regulated, not only optimizing the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates but also accelerating the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Ru/C60&#8208;300 exhibits remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution in an alkaline condition. This study demonstrates a facile and efficient method for synthesizing effective fullerene&#8208;supported metal cluster catalysts without any pretreatment and additional reducing agent.

         <title>D&#8208;Band&#8208;Center&#8208;Engineered Platinum&#8208;Based Nanozyme for Personalized Pharmacovigilance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between d&#8208;band centers and hydrogen peroxide activation barriers was used to screen platinum&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped nanozymes, which effectively enabled sensitive analysis of trace CO&#8208;releasing molecules in the blood, suggesting that catalysts designed on the basis of d&#8208;band centers are of great significance in drug monitoring and metabolic management.







Abstract
A high&#8208;efficiency PtZnCd nanozyme was screened with density functional theory (DFT) and unique d&#8208;orbital coupling features for sensitive enrichment and real&#8208;time analysis of CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;3 (CORM&#8208;3). Multicatalytic sites in the nanozyme showed a high reactivity of up to 72.89&#8197;min&#8722;1 for peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like reaction, which was 2.2, 4.07, and 14.67 times higher than that of PtZn (32.67&#8197;min&#8722;1), PtCd (17.89&#8197;min&#8722;1), and Pt (4.97&#8197;min&#8722;1), respectively. Normalization of the catalytic sites showed that the catalytic capacity of the active site in PtZnCd was 2.962&#8197;U &#956;mol&#8722;1, which was four times higher than that of a pure Pt site (0.733&#8197;U &#956;mol&#8722;1). DFT calculations showed that improved d&#8208;orbital coupling between different metals reduces the position of the center of the shifted whole d&#8208;band relative to the Fermi energy level, thereby increasing the contribution of the sites to the electron transfer from the active center, accompanied by enhanced substrate adsorption and intermediate conversion in the catalytic process. The potential adsorption principle and color development mechanism of CORM&#8208;3 on PtZnCd were determined, and its practical application in drug metabolism was validated in vitro and in zebrafish and mice models, demonstrating that transition&#8208;metal doping effectively engineers high&#8208;performance nanozymes and optimizes artificial enzymes.

Na2WO4/SiO2, a formulation known to be active for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), catalyzes selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in H2&#8208;hydrocarbon&#8208;O2 mixtures at 873&#8211;983&#8197;K, with H2 combustion kinetics dependent only on the hydrogen partial pressure. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrate that the Na2WO4 phase is disordered under reaction conditions, even at temperatures below the bulk Na2WO4 melting point.







Abstract
Na2WO4/SiO2, a material known to catalyze alkane selective oxidation including the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), is demonstrated to catalyze selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) with &gt;97&#8201;% selectivity in mixtures with several hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, C6H6) in the presence of gas&#8208;phase dioxygen at 883&#8211;983&#8197;K. Hydrogen combustion rates exhibit a near&#8208;first&#8208;order dependence on H2 partial pressure and are zero&#8208;order in H2O and O2 partial pressures. Mechanistic studies at 923&#8197;K using isotopically&#8208;labeled reagents demonstrate the kinetic relevance of H&#8722;H dissociation and absence of O&#8208;atom recombination. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and W LIII&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies demonstrate, respectively, a loss of Na2WO4 crystallinity and lack of second&#8208;shell coordination with respect to W6+ cations below 923&#8197;K; benchmark experiments show that alkali cations must be present for the material to be selective for hydrogen combustion, but that materials containing Na alone have much lower combustion rates (per gram Na) than those containing Na and W. These data suggest a synergy between Na and W in a disordered phase at temperatures below the bulk melting point of Na2WO4 (971&#8197;K) during SHC catalysis. The Na2WO4/SiO2 SHC catalyst maintains stable combustion rates at temperatures ca. 100&#8197;K higher than redox&#8208;active SHC catalysts and could potentially enable enhanced olefin yields in tandem operation of reactors combining alkane dehydrogenation with SHC processes.

         <title>Chemoselective Construction of Polycyclic Heterocycles Containing a [6&#8208;6&#8208;5] or [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] Tricyclic Core Skeleton from a 2&#8208;Isocyanophenyl Propargylic Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New functionalized isocyanides featuring both isocyano and propargylic ester moieties were readily synthesized. The cascade reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic esters and 2&#8208;aminoaromatic aldimines enabled the construction of pentacyclic skeletons. Another structurally unique chromeno [3,2&#8208;f] azepine with a quarternary carbon center and [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] core structure was also observed when a 2&#8208;hydroxyaromatic aldimine was utilized.







Abstract
Functionalized isocyanide chemistry represents an important research area in organic synthesis. A structurally unique 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester has been designed to incorporate the reactivity of isocyanide and propargylic ester functionalities. Thus, the reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester and 2&#8208;aminoaromatic aldimine facilitates the synthesis of a wide range of polycyclic benzo[b] indolo [3,2&#8208;h][1,6] naphthyridine derivatives. Furthermore, reaction with 2&#8208;hydroxyaromatic aldimine enables the divergent synthesis of both the aforementioned scaffolds and structurally distinct diazabenzo [f] naphtho[2,3,4&#8208;ij] azulenes featuring a [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] core skeleton. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that these transformations likely proceed by the in situ generation of a strained cyclopropenimine species followed by [3+2] cycloaddition. Next, switchable nucleophilic attack/ring expansion/aromatization and nucleophilic addition/ring expansion/elimination account for the observed selectivity.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis through Microbial Ecosystem Engineering on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial ecosystem engineering enables efficient solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis over a biohybrid photocatalyst. The syntrophic coculture of Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri) with the electron transport specialist Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400) over carbon nitride produced a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst for the sunlight&#8208;driven methane synthesis from carbon dioxide.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in solar chemistry to drive sustainable chemical reactions.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;induced Chiral Self&#8208;assembly for the In situ Construction, Modulation, Amplification and Applications of Asymmetric Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly offers a powerful method to in situ construct, modulate, amplify the asymmetric suprastructures. Further design of novel helical polymers requires exploring new PICSA systems, exploiting the multiple effects of asymmetric amplification discussed in Section&#8197;3, and designing appropriate building blocks to obtain stable binding strengths.







Abstract
In the polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) process, chiral functional monomers undergo spontaneous supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and asymmetric stacking during living polymerization, leading to the in situ generation of chiroptical polymer assemblies characterized by diverse morphologies. The PICSA strategy facilitates precise control and manipulation of both non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helices and covalent macromolecular helices within aggregated cores, thereby driving significant advancements in fields such as chiral recognition materials, asymmetric catalysts, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals (LC). This minireview summarizes recent developments in the in situ chiroptical construction and modulation associated with the PICSA methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to elucidate emerging PICSA systems founded on various living polymerization mechanisms, exploring hierarchical chirality transfer processes and the pathway complexities in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. This minireview also presents several illustrative examples that demonstrate the practical applications of chiral polymer materials synthesized through the PICSA approach, thereby illuminating future opportunities in this innovative field.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Cold&#8208;Pressed Garnet Composite Electrolytes with Enhanced Li+ Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing Li+ conduction in cold&#8208;pressed Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (Ta&#8722;LZ) is achieved through the incorporation of Li6PS5Cl (LPSC). The formation of a Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure effectively integrates Ta&#8722;LZ with LPSC, facilitating interparticle Li+ transport. Moreover, Li dendrites and self&#8208;discharge are suppressed owing to the low electronic conductivity of Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC.







Abstract
Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) hold promise for realizing next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries with high energy density. However, the high stiffness of high&#8208;temperature sintered LLZO makes it brittle and susceptible to strain during the fabrication of solid&#8208;state batteries. Cold&#8208;pressed LLZO exhibits improved ductility but suffers from insufficient Li+ conductivity. Here, we report cold&#8208;pressed Ta&#8208;doped LLZO (Ta&#8722;LZ) particles integrated with ductile Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) via a Li+ conductive Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure. This configuration creates a continuous Li+ conduction network by enhancing the Li+ exchange at the Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC interface. The resulting Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE exhibits Li+ conductivity of 4.42&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.31&#8197;eV. Li symmetric cells with Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE demonstrate excellent Li dendrite suppression ability, with an improved critical current density of 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a prolonged cycle life exceeding 600&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

The formation of a Li-containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure effectively integrates Ta&#8722;LZ with LPSC, facilitating interparticle Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Moreover, Li dendrites and self-discharge are suppressed owing to the low electronic conductivity of Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC.

However, the high stiffness of high-temperature sintered LLZO makes it brittle and susceptible to strain during the fabrication of solid-state batteries. Cold-pressed LLZO exhibits improved ductility but suffers from insufficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. Here, we report cold-pressed Ta-doped LLZO (Ta&#8722;LZ) particles integrated with ductile Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (LPSC) via a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductive Li-containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure. This configuration creates a continuous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction network by enhancing the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange at the Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC interface. The resulting Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE exhibits Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 4.42&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low activation energy of 0.31&#8197;eV.

         <title>Reversible Structural Phase Transitions in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;Based Metal Halides for Dynamically Tunable Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zero&#8208;dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides exhibit reversible phase transitions accompanied by a fluorescence shift from cyan to yellow&#8208;orange. Their luminescence and phase transition mechanisms are elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. By harnessing their reversible phase transitions, a dynamic tunable multicolor emission anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with high security and unforgeability is demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring structural phase transitions and luminescence mechanisms in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides poses significant challenges, that are crucial for unlocking the full potential of tunable optical properties and diversifying their functional capabilities. Herein, we have designed two inter&#8208;transformable 0D Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides, namely (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6, through distinct synthesis conditions utilizing identical reactants. Their optical properties and luminescence mechanisms were systematically elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. The bright cyan&#8208;fluorescent (C19H18P)2CuI3 with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 77&#8201;% is attributed to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Differently, the broad yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence of (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 displays a remarkable PLQY of 83&#8201;%. Its luminescence mechanism is mainly attributed to the combined effects of metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer and cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer, which effects stem from the strong Cu&#8722;Cu bonding interactions in the (Cu4I6)2&#8722; clusters. Moreover, (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 exhibit reversible structural phase transitions. The elucidation of the phase transitions mechanism has paved the way for an unforgeable anti&#8208;counterfeiting system. This system dynamically shifts between cyan and yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence, triggered by the phase transitions, bolstering security and authenticity. This work enriches the luminescence theory of 0D metal halides, offering novel strategies for optical property modulation and fostering optical applications.

         <title>Dibenzoquinone Cyclopentadithiophene Diradicaloids Show Optical Transitions of Different Spin States and Anomalous Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bis(semiquinone) linearly &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds with dithiophene bridges of different lengths were prepared that ranged from closed&#8208;shell (the smallest) to full diradical (the longest) accompanied with narrow singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (magnetic response).

Abstract
We have prepared a series of bis(semiquinone) compounds with dithiophene bridges of different length that evolve from closed&#8208;shell (smaller compound) to full diradical (longer compound) for which the narrow singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap allows the triplet population at 298&#8197;K. The medium size system has a variety of photonic properties with absorptions and emission in the optical near&#8208;infrared region mediated by a unique case of anti&#8208;Kasha emission. A whole set of optical absorption/emission and vibrational steady state spectroscopies as well as picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, all complemented with spectroelectrochemistry and theoretical calculations, is presented.

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalysis&#8208;Integrated Bioorthogonal (Poly)Catalyst&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Living Cell Membrane Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunoassay methods, notably enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs),&#160;renowned for their signal amplification capabilities, are extensively employed in scientific research and clinical diagnostics. However, the instability of enzymes and their sensitivity to cellular environments present significant challenges for the broad application of ELISA in living cells. In this work, we present a bioorthogonal (poly)catalysis&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA) designed for the detection of cell membrane antigens, which&#160;involves&#160;coupling bioorthogonal catalysts based on small molecules or polymers to antibodies. After screening, we opted for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as the core reaction system. The polymer&#8208;based catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity at the same molecular concentration due to their multiple catalytic sites. Polytriazoles formed during the CuAAC reaction have the ability to chelate Cu(I),&#160;therebypromoting faster catalysis. By harnessing this autocatalytic feature, we successfully increased the signal amplification potential of BCLISA. Ultimately, this autocatalysis&#8208;integrated BCLISA technique was employed for antigen detection and imaging on both&#160;in vitro&#160;and living cell membranes. This approach&#160;offers&#160;a new method for the detection and imaging of low&#8208;abundance antigens on living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Ionic Conductivity in Polymer Electrolytes for Flexible, All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Operating at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity for room&#8208;temperature operation is essential for advancing flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state energy storage devices. Innovative strategies are urgently required to develop SPEs that are safe, stable, and high&#8208;performing. In this work,&#160;we introduce photoexcitation&#8208;modulated heterojunctions as catalytically active fillers within SPEs, guided by photocatalytic design principles, and employ natural bacterial cellulose to enhance the mechanical properties of the inorganic&#8208;filled SPEs. In&#8208;situ photothermal experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong photogenerated electric field produced by trace heterojunctions within poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes under photoexcitation significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation, increasing the concentration of mobile Li+. This results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.135 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, with a Li+ transference number as high as 0.46. The flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal pouch cells exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 178.8 mAh g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending and folding, and demonstrate exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 86.7% of their initial capacity after 250 cycles at 1 C (25 &#176;C). This research offers a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyzing PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerizations Using Inherently Photoactive Zinc Myoglobin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalyzed reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizations are achieved using photoactive zinc myoglobin without the need for any additional reducing agents or co&#8208;catalysts. Zinc myoglobin shows improved catalytic activity over the free zinc porphyrin cofactor (zinc mesoporphyrin IX) and leads to controlled polymerizations with predictable molecular weights, low dispersities, and retention of chain&#8208;end functional groups.







Abstract
Protein photocatalysts provide a modular platform to access new reaction pathways and affect product outcomes, but their use in polymer synthesis is limited because co&#8208;catalysts and/or co&#8208;reductants are required to complete catalytic cycles. Herein, we report using zinc myoglobin (ZnMb), an inherently photoactive protein, to mediate photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizations. Using ZnMb as the sole reagent for catalysis, photomediated polymerizations of N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide in PBS were achieved with predictable molecular weights, dispersity values approaching 1.1, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. We found that initial apparent rate constants of polymerization increased from 4.6&#215;10&#8211;5&#8197;s&#8722;1 for zinc mesoporpyhrin IX (ZnMIX) to 6.5&#215;10&#8211;5&#8197;s&#8722;1 when ZnMIX was incorporated into myoglobin to yield ZnMb, indicating that the protein binding site enhanced catalytic activity. Chain extension reactions comparing ZnMb&#8208;mediated RAFT polymerizations to thermally&#8208;initiated RAFT polymerizations showed minimal differences in block copolymer molecular weights and dispersities. This work enables studies to elucidate how protein modifications (e.g., secondary structure folding, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, directed evolution) can be used to modulate polymerization outcomes (e.g., selective monomer additions towards sequence control, tacticity control, molar mass distributions).

         <title>The Swiss Army Knife of Electrodes: Pillar[6]arene&#8208;Modified Electrodes for Molecular Electrocatalysis Over a Wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[6]arene&#8208;functionalised indium tin oxide electrodes can be modified with electrocatalytically active ruthenium complexes through host&#8211;guest interactions. These versatile electrodes exhibit activity for reactions across a broad pH range (2.4&#8211;10.8) and can be reused after reabsorption of the desorbed catalyst. Different electrocatalytic transformations can be conducted under varying conditions utilising the same electrode.







Abstract
Molecularly&#8208;modified electrode materials that maintain stability over a broad pH range are rare. Typically, each electrochemical transformation necessitates a specifically tuned system to achieve strong binding and high activity of the catalyst. Here, we report the functionalisation of mesoporous indium tin oxide (mITO) electrodes with the macrocyclic host molecule pillar[6]arene (PA[6]). These electrodes are stable within the pH range of 2.4&#8211;10.8 and can be equipped with electrochemically active ruthenium complexes through host&#8211;guest interactions to perform various oxidation reactions. Benzyl alcohol oxidation serves as a model reaction in acidic media, while ammonia oxidation is conducted to assess the systems performance under basic conditions. PA[6]&#8208;modified electrodes demonstrate catalytic activity for both reactions when complexed to different guest molecules and can be reused by reabsorption of the catalyst after its degradation. Furthermore, the system can be employed to perform subsequent reactions in electrolyte with varying pH, enabling the same electrode to be utilised in multiple different electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Stereogenic and Axially Chiral BODIPYs via Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H (Hetero)Arylation with Diazonaphthoquinones and Diazoindenines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular engineering of boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) has garnered widespread attention due to their structural diversity enabling tailored physicochemical properties for optimal applications. However, catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse boron&#8208;stereogenic BODIPYs through intermolecular desymmetrization and BODIPYs with atroposelectivity remains elusive. Here, we showcase rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific C&#8208;H (hetero)arylations of prochiral BODIPYs and polysubstituted BODIPYs with diazonaphthoquinonesand diazoindenines, providing efficient pathways for the rapid assembly of versatile (hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs through long&#8208;range desymmetrization and axial rotational restriction modes. The synthetic application of the procedures has been emphasized by the efficient synthesis of BODIPY derivatives with various functions. Photophysical properties, bioimaging, and lipid droplet&#8208;specific targeting capability of tailored BODIPYs are also demonstrated, indicating their promising applications in biomedical research, medicinal chemistry, and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal Tin Halide Perovskite Films with High Structural Integrity for Near&#8208;infrared Imaging Array enabling Hidden Object Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) image sensors based on solution&#8208;processed thin film are gaining prominence in various applications, including security detection, remote sensing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring, owing to superior penetration capabilities of NIR light. However, the reported perovskite image sensors suffer from limited resolution and performance due to poor structural integrity, bioincompatibility, and constrained response wavelength range from lead&#8208;based perovskite materials employed. In this study, we present non&#8208;toxic quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films, prepared via a simple spin&#8208;coating technique, that demonstrate high structural integrity and effective NIR response. Through a series of in situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables a more oriented crystal growth with reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8208;890 nm). Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high&#8208;resolution 64 &#215; 64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non&#8208;uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63 nW cm&#8208;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;resolution NIR imaging arrays.</dc:description>

Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high-resolution 64 &#215; 64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non-uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin-film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63 nW cm-2) real-time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead-free perovskite for high-resolution NIR imaging arrays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Despite extensive efforts to develop &#947;&#8208;lactamization reactions for pyrrolidinone synthesis using either cyclometallation, C&#8722;H insertion, or radical C&#8722;H abstraction strategies, &#947;&#8208;lactamization reactions of aliphatic amides using practical catalysts and common protecting groups remain extremely rare.

         <title>Copper Atom Pairs Stabilize *OCCO Dipole Toward Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (Cu2) catalyst featuring dual&#8208;Cu atomic pairs, which delivers a high FE of 51&#8201;% toward C2H4 and a current density of 450&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, markedly surpassing the performance of Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts and Cu nanoparticles. The results reveal that the unique Cu atom pairs in Cu2 regulate the adsorption energy of *CO to facilitate C&#8722;C dimerization and stabilize the *OCCO intermediate dipole to promote the C2H4 pathway.







Abstract
Deeply electrolytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high&#8208;value ethylene (C2H4) is very attractive. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling seriously results in the low selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to C2H4. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;based polyhedron (Cu2) that features uniformly distributed and atomically precise bi&#8208;Cu units, which can stabilize *OCCO dipole to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling for high selective C2H4 production. The C2H4 faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 51&#8201;% with a current density of 469.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, much superior to the Cu single site catalyst (Cu SAC) (~0&#8201;%). Moreover, the Cu2 catalyst has a higher turnover frequency (TOF, ~520&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to Cu nanoparticles (~9.42&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Cu SAC (~0.87&#8197;h&#8722;1). In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique Cu2 structural configuration could optimize the dipole moments and stabilize the *OCCO adsorbate to promote the generation of C2H4.

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction for the efficient synthesis angularly fused M/5/N tricyclic skeletons (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) has been explored. In this novel transformation, the priority of ring expansion could be predicted by the rational design of the ring size and substituents. Employing the reaction as a key step, we finished total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.







Abstract
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33&#8197;examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95&#8201;%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.

         <title>Anion Chemistry towards On&#8208;Site Construction of Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Metallic Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of lacking effective SEI on Zn anode in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte, a cathodic route was developed to achieve a uniform OTf&#8722;&#8208;involved artificial SEI on Zn anode, which brings the merits of promoting interfacial kinetics, depressing side reactions, and prolonging ZMB lifespan.







Abstract
Reversibility of metallic Zn anode serves as the corner stone for the development of aqueous Zn metal battery, which motivates scrutinizing the electrolyte&#8208;Zn interface. As the representative organic zinc salt, zinc trifluorosulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) facilitates a broad class of aqueous electrolytes, however, the stability issue of Zn anode remains crucial. The great challenge lies in the lack of Zn anode protection by the pristinely formed surface structure in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes. Accordingly, an electrochemical route was developed to grow a uniform zinc trifluorosulfonate hydroxide (ZTH) layer on Zn anode as an artificial SEI, via regulation on metal dissolution and strong coordination ability of zinc ions. Co&#8208;precipitation was proposed to be the formation mechanism for the artificial SEI, where the reduction stability of OTf&#8722; anion and the low&#8208;symmetry layer structure of ZTH was unmasked. This artificial SEI favors interfacial kinetics, depresses side reactions, and well maintains its integrity during cycling, leading to a prolonged lifespan of Zn stripping/plating with a high DOD of ~85&#8201;%, and an improved cycling stability of ~92&#8201;% retention rate for V2O5/Zn cell at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The unveiled role of anion on Zn anode drives the contemplation on the surface chemistry for the blooming aqueous rechargeable battery.

         <title>Electrochemical Homo&#8208; and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6&#8208;Diarylpyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular Homo&#8208;couplings, but especially Cross&#8208;couplings are challenging! We reported an electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles using triarylamine as a redox mediator to form substituted pyridines. Our process demonstrates unprecedented control of chemoselectivity, allowing both homo&#8208; and heterocouplings of alkynes and nitriles. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, supported by CV, EPR, NMR, and computational studies.







Abstract
We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low&#8208;cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale&#8208;up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.

     alt="Electrochemical Homo- and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio- and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6-Diarylpyridines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intermolecular Homo-couplings, but especially Cross-couplings are challenging&lt;/b&gt;! We reported an electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles using triarylamine as a redox mediator to form substituted pyridines. Our process demonstrates unprecedented control of chemoselectivity, allowing both homo- and heterocouplings of alkynes and nitriles. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, supported by CV, EPR, NMR, and computational studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low-cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale-up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;-extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Coordination Solvation Structure for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries via Electric Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric dipole&#8208;dipole interaction enables the interfacial richness of high&#8208;dipole FPy with low coordination towards Li+, extruding the coordinated solvent in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance. The low&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordination structure strengthens Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; coordination, facilitating TFSI&#8722; decomposition to generate a LiF&#8208;rich SEI film.







Abstract
Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li+ ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation&#8208;desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion&#8208;transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, a key component for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole&#8208;dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2&#8208;fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO2||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO2 batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal&#8208;ion/metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereospecific alternating copolymerization of different chiral cyclic esters is one feasible approach to enrich the structural diversity of copolyesters and tailor their properties. However, dramatically different reactivities of different cyclic esters let a perfectly stereospecific alternating polymerization of these cyclic esters be a challenge, thus the catalyst is required to balance their reactivities. Herein, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was discovered and successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide (S, S&#8208;LA) and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide (R, R&#8208;EG)/R, R&#8208;propylglycolide (R, R&#8208;PG) during their heterospecific alternating copolymerization. The enantiomorphic site of R, R&#8208;SalenAl complex can increase the relative reactivity of R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG and suppress that of S, S&#8208;LA, then a perfectly alternating sequence of the copolymer of S, S&#8208;LA and R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG can be achieved (Palt = 0.96/0.91); inversely, using S, S&#8208;SalenAl complex, the significant enantiomorphic site effect enlarges the reactivity difference of two monomers, the alternating level was just 0.70/0.68 even to 0.61. Poly(S, S&#8208;LA&#8208;alt&#8208;R, R&#8208;EG) with a high alternating regularity exhibits lower glass transition temperatures and a dramatically higher elongation at break (&#949;B = 449 &#177; 51% (Palt = 0.96) vs &#949;B = 6 &#177; 1% (Palt = 0.70)).</dc:description>

         <title>Growth Kinetics of Graphene on Cu(111) Foils from Methane, Ethyne, Ethylene, and Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We obtained the activation enthalpies of graphene island growth on Cu(111) foils using H2 and: CH4, and C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, respectively. The rate determining step (RDS) for CH4 is its gas phase decomposition to H and CH3. The RDS for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 is dehydrogenation on the Cu(111) surface yielding adsorbed C2H1, C2H3, and C2H5, respectively.







Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition of carbon precursors on Cu&#8208;based substrates at temperatures exceeding 1000&#8201;&#176;C is currently a typical route for the scalable synthesis of large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) films. Using molecules with higher activities than CH4 may afford lower growth temperatures that might yield fold&#8208; and wrinkle&#8208;free graphene. The kinetics of growth of graphene using hydrocarbons other than CH4 are of interest to the scientific and industrial communities. We measured the growth rates of graphene islands on Cu(111) foils by using C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4, respectively (each mixed with H2). From such kinetics data we obtain the activation enthalpy (&#916;H&#8800;) of graphene growth as shown in parentheses (C2H2 (0.93&#177;0.09&#8197;eV); C2H4 (2.05&#177;0.19&#8197;eV); C2H6 (2.50&#177;0.11&#8197;eV); CH4 (4.59&#177;0.26&#8197;eV)); C2Hy (y=2, 4, 6) show similar growth behavior but CH4 is different. Computational fluid dynamics and density functional theory simulations suggest that C2Hy differs from CH4 due to different values of adsorption energy and the lifetime of relevant carbon precursors on the Cu(111) surface. Combining experimental and simulation results, we find that the rate determining step (RDS) is the dissociation of the first C&#8722;H bond of CH4 molecules in the gas phase, while the RDS using C2Hy is the first dehydrogenation of adsorbed C2Hy that happens with assistance of H atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. By using C2H2 as the carbon precursor, high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal adlayer&#8208;free SLG films are achieved on Cu(111) foils at 900&#8201;&#176;C.

The RDS for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is dehydrogenation on the Cu(111) surface yielding adsorbed C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical vapor deposition of carbon precursors on Cu-based substrates at temperatures exceeding 1000&#8201;&#176;C is currently a typical route for the scalable synthesis of large-area high-quality single-layer graphene (SLG) films. Using molecules with higher activities than CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may afford lower growth temperatures that might yield fold- and wrinkle-free graphene. The kinetics of growth of graphene using hydrocarbons other than CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are of interest to the scientific and industrial communities. We measured the growth rates of graphene islands on Cu(111) foils by using C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively (each mixed with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). From such kinetics data we obtain the activation enthalpy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;) of graphene growth as shown in parentheses (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0.93&#177;0.09&#8197;eV); C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (2.05&#177;0.19&#8197;eV); C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (2.50&#177;0.11&#8197;eV); CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (4.59&#177;0.26&#8197;eV)); C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (y=2, 4, 6) show similar growth behavior but CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is different. Computational fluid dynamics and density functional theory simulations suggest that C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; differs from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; due to different values of adsorption energy and the lifetime of relevant carbon precursors on the Cu(111) surface. Combining experimental and simulation results, we find that the rate determining step (RDS) is the dissociation of the first C&#8722;H bond of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in the gas phase, while the RDS using C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; is the first dehydrogenation of adsorbed C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; that happens with assistance of H atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. By using C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the carbon precursor, high-quality single-crystal adlayer-free SLG films are achieved on Cu(111) foils at 900&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Monoborylation of Methane by a Mono Bipyridyl&#8208;Nickel(II)&#160;Hydride Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of an earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst for methane C&#8210;H borylation. The post&#8208;synthetic metalation of bipyridine&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) with NiBr2, followed by treatment of NaEt3BH affords MOF&#8208;supported monomeric bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species via active site isolation. The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200 &#186;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH3Bpin in 61% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH2&#8208;species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8208;Ni catalyst,&#160; its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl&#8208;nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover&#8208;limiting &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF&#8208;based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Exciton Effects in Functionalized Conjugated Polymers by B&#8208;N Lewis Pairs for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong excitonic effects are common in organic conjugated polymer semiconductors, severely hindering the generation of free charge carriers for conducting photocatalysis. Therefore, exploring new channels to modulate exciton dissociation in polymers is far&#8208;reaching in facilitating photocatalysis. A series of B&#8208;N Lewis pair functionalized conjugated polymers have been developed to minimize exciton effects by modulating charge transfer pathways. Theoretical studies have shown that introducing B&#8208;N Lewis pairs can dramatically increase the distance of charge transfer (D index) and the amount of electron transfer and reduce the Coulomb attraction energy (EC), which contributes to breaking the equilibrium of the coexistence of excitons and charge carriers. Further experimental results show that the singlet excitons are efficiently dissociated into more free&#8208;charge carriers under photoexcitation to participate in surface reactions. The optimized polymer PyPBM shows an exponential increase in photocatalytic hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production performance by visible light illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Assisted Hydrogen Bonding: A Game&#8208;Changer in Lead Passivation and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies comparable to silicon&#8208;based solar cells, yet their instability under environmental stressors, such as humidity, heat, and light, remains a significant barrier to commercialization. A primary cause of this instability is the uncoordinated lead ions (Pb2+), which accelerates the degradation of PSCs and pose environmental concerns due to potential lead leakage. Recently, the introduction of ligands into PSCs has shown promise in mitigating lead toxicity through effective passivation, primarily by forming hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) between functional groups of the ligands and the perovskite structure. In this minireview, we explore the critical role of H&#8208;bonds in stabilizing PSCs by enhancing the structural integrity of the perovskite layer and reducing lead leakage. Furthermore, we discuss the contribution of these ligands in defect passivation, hydrophobicity, self&#8208;encapsulation, cross&#8208;linking, and self&#8208;healing mechanisms. These insights will highlight the multi&#8208;functional capabilities of ligands in improving the long&#8208;term stability and durability of PSCs, offering pathways to address current challenges in their commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Synergistic Interplay between Atomic&#8208;Scale Vacancies and Ligand Effect to Optimize the Oxygen Reduction Activity and Tolerance Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG) have been engineered. The atomic&#8208;scale vacancies and Ni dopant induce long&#8208;range lattice distortions and ligand effects, respectively. Due to their synergistic interplay, Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG exhibit enhanced catalytic activity, sufficient tolerance capabilities, and exceptional durability for the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Defect engineering is an effective strategy for regulating the electrocatalysis of nanomaterials, yet it is seldom considered for modulating Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we designed Ni&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG) with a low Pt loading of 3.5&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% and a Ni/Pt ratio of 0.038&#8201;:&#8201;1. Physical characterizations confirmed the presence of abundant atomic&#8208;scale vacancies in the Pt NPs induces long&#8208;range lattice distortions, and the Ni dopant generates a ligand effect resulting in electronic transfer from Ni to Pt. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicated that atomic&#8208;scale vacancies mainly contributed the tolerance performances towards CO and CH3OH, the ligand effect derived from a tiny of Ni dopant accelerated the transformation from *O to *OH species, thereby improved the ORR activity without compromising the tolerance capabilities. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay between atomic&#8208;scale vacancies and ligand effect, as&#8208;prepared Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG exhibited improved ORR activity, sufficient tolerance capabilities, and excellent durability. This study offers a new avenue for modulating the electrocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes in a 1,2&#8208;addition fashion, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity as well as deuterated stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes through regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8208;cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3&#8208;dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er. Application of this method to construction of axial stereogenicity and deuterated stereogenic center provided a wide range of multifunctional chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Regio-, Diastereo- and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of 1,3-Dienes and Aldehydes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach for highly regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt-based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes in a 1,2-addition fashion, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity as well as deuterated stereogenic centers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes through regio- and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio- and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine-cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3-dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre-formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er. Application of this method to construction of axial stereogenicity and deuterated stereogenic center provided a wide range of multifunctional chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access. DFT calculations revealed the origin of regio- and stereoselectivity as well as a unique oxidative cyclization mechanism for cobalt catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Micro/Meso&#8208;Porous Double&#8208;Shell Hollow Carbon Spheres through Spatially Confined Pyrolysis for Supercapacitors and Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique confined pyrolysis method has been used for the creation of a hollow structure with a dual shell structure consisting of both microporous and mesoporous features. Basing on the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor is established.







Abstract
Energy storage in supercapacitors and hybrid zinc ion capacitors (ZIC) using porous carbon materials offers a promising alternative method for clean energy solutions. The unique combination of hierarchical porous structure and nitrogen doping in these materials has demonstrated significant capacity for energy storage. Nevertheless, the full potential of these materials, particularly the relationship between pore structure configuration and performance, remains underexplored. Herein, a confined pyrolysis strategy based on the polymerization characteristics of polydopamine (PDA) was developed to construction of hollow carbon spheres with microporous/mesoporous dual shell structure. The depth of micropores and cavity can be controlled by adjusting the duration of heat treatment and hydrothermal treatment, in accordance with the decomposition and polymerization characteristics of PDA. Due to the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and ZIC is established. Through optimizing the ion transport capacity of carbon spheres and considering the influence of its internal cavity structure on energy storage, the resulting carbon spheres exhibit high specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in supercapacitor and specific capacitance of 260&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability with 99.3&#8201;% retention after 30000&#8197;chare/discharge cycles in ZIC.

         <title>Development of the esterase PestE for amide bond synthesis under aqueous conditions: Enzyme cascades for converting waste PET into tamibarotene.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A growing number of hydrolase enzymes show promiscuous acyltransferase activity, even under aqueous conditions. Here we report, for the first time, the ability of Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 esterase (PestE) to catalyse the formation of a wide range of amides in buffer, where the acyl donor forms a significant structural component in the amide product. The reactions occur under mild conditions and can achieve conversions up to 97% in 6 h for formation of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide as the model reaction. We demonstrate PestE&#8217;s potential in enzyme cascades to make amides from waste PET plastic and the conversion of the terephthalic acid product to tamibarotene, a drug with activity against acute leukemia. Rational mutagenesis led to identification of PestE variants F33L_F289A and F33L. F33L_F289A increased conversion of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide by 1.2&#8208;fold, and F33L gave a 4&#8208;fold increase in conversion to tamibarotene.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Single Ni Sites on 3D Cage&#8208;like Cucurbit[n]uril Ligands for Efficient and Selective CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 selective reduction with high conversion is a challenging task yet holds immense promise for both CO2 neutralization and green fuel production. Enhancing CO2 adsorption at the catalytic centre can trigger a highly efficient CO2 capture&#8208;to&#8208;conversion process. Herein, we introduce cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a new family of molecular ligands, as a key component in the creation of a 3D cage&#8208;like metal (nickel, Ni)&#8208;complex molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) for photocatalysis. It exhibits an unprecedented CO yield rate of 72.1 &#181;mol&#183; h&#8208;1 with a high selectivity of 97.9% under visible light irradiation. To verify the origin of the carbon source in the products, a straightforward isotopic tracing method is designed based on tandem reactions. The catalytic process commences with photoelectron transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Ni2+ site, resulting in the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+. The locally enriched CO2 molecules in the cage ligand CB[7] undergo selective reduction by the Ni+ nearby to form CO product. This work exemplifies the inspiring potential of ligand structure engineering in advancing the development of efficient unanchored molecular co&#8208;catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Impacts on Acyclic Mechanochemical Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of stereochemistry on the mechanochemistry rate is studied using a new mechanophore based on a benzopinacol (BP) skeleton. Two sets of BP diastereomers, the meso R,S and the R,R/S,S were isolated, incorporated into the center of a poly(methyl acrylate), and their mechanical activation rate was measured in solution. Under mechanical stress, the central C&#8208;C bond in BP is cleaved, providing two independent benzophenone molecules with higher UV&#8208;absorption coefficient at 254 nm. Monitoring the reaction rate spectroscopically indicates that the chiral R,R/S,S enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster compared to the meso R,S diastereomer. In&#8208;silico modeling indicates that a hydrogen bond between the syn hydroxyls in the R,R diastereomer becomes shorter with stress, reducing the maximal force required for C&#8208;C bond scission, while this bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl are anti to each other. Our results indicate that in polymer where free rotation around bonds is possible, non&#8208;covalent interactions between backbone substituents, which are affected by relative stereochemistry, can play a fundamental role in the mechanochemical stability of the polymer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods enabling direct C&#8208;H alkylation of heterocycles are of fundamental importance in the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products, bioactive molecules, and medicinally relevant compounds. However, there is a scarcity of a general strategy for the direct C&#8208;H alkylation of a variety of heterocycles using commercially available alkyl surrogates. We report an operationally simple palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8208;H alkylation of heterocycles using alkyl halides under the visible light irradiation with good scalability and functional group tolerance. Our studies suggest that the photoinduced alkylation proceeds through cascade of events comprising, site&#8208;selective alkyl radical addition, base&#8208;assisted deprotonation, and oxidation. A combination of experiments and computations was employed for the generalization of this strategy, which was successfully translated towards the modification of natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

Varying the alkyne substituents enabled the isolation and characterization of dinuclear dialkynedichromium intermediates which thermally convert to the products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Defined Stem&#8208;Loop Structure Library for the Discovery of L&#8208;RNA Aptamers that Target RNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been developed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) and regulate G4&#8208;mediated gene expression. However, the aptamer selection process is laborious and challenging, and aptamer identification is subjected to high failure rate. By analyzing the previously reported G4&#8208;binding L&#8208;RNA aptamers, we found that the stem&#8208;loop (SL) structure is favored by G4 binding. Herein, we present a robust and effective G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq platform specifically for G4 targets by introducing a pre&#8208;defined stem&#8208;loop structure library during SELEX process. Using G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq, we rapidly identified an L&#8208;RNA aptamer, L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 for EBNA1 RNA G4 (rG4) in just three selection rounds. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 maintained the stem&#8208;loop structure initially introduced, and possessed a unique G&#8208;triplex motif that is important for the strong binding affinity and specificity to EBNA1 rG4. Notably, L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 effectively downregulated endogenous EBNA1 protein expression in human cancer cells and showed selective toxicity towards EBV&#8208;positive cancer cells, highlighting its potential for targeted therapy against EBV&#8208;associated cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness and generality of G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq by selecting L&#8208;RNA aptamers for another two G4 targets&#8208;APP rG4 and HCV&#8208;1a rG4, also obtaining high&#8208;affinity aptamers in three selection rounds. These findings demonstrated G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq can be a robust and efficient platform for the selection of L&#8208;RNA aptamers targeting rG4.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Robust and Microporous B&#8592;N Framework with 8&#8208;connected Sandwich Nodes for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently B&#8592;N organic frameworks (BNFs) have gained substantial attention owing to their unique dative bond energy, which imparts them with specialized functionalities across a broad spectrum of applications. Despite previous reports on BNFs with permanent porosity, research endeavors towards three&#8208;dimensional (3D) BNFs with similar properties are scarce, with no report of robust 3D BNFs featuring permanent porosity to date.&#160;Herein,&#160;electrostatic complementarystrategy&#160;is&#160;proposed&#160;to construct&#160;the first example of&#160;3D&#160;robust and microporous&#160;BNF,&#160;BNF&#8208;100, featuring a&#160;reo&#160;topology with 8&#8208;connected sandwich nodes assembled via dative B&#8592;N bonds. The activated form&#160;BNF&#8208;100a&#160;exhibits excellent chemical stability and permanent porosity with Langmuir surface area of 645.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and pore volume of 0.23&#8201;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1.&#160;BNF&#8208;100a&#160;can efficiently separate hexane isomers through sieving mechanisms, as confirmed by vapor adsorption experiments and dynamic breakthrough tests, surpassing the performance of most MOF materials.&#160;Finally, we achieved the purification of different branched hexane isomers using a single breakthrough column in a combined breakthrough and purging experiment, which is the first reported instance in the literature on hexane isomer separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Interfacial Lattice Matching by Selective Epitaxial Growth of CuS Crystals on Bi2WO6 Nanosheets for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction into Solar Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an important technology for value&#8208;added solar fuel production; however, it is generally limited by interfacial charge transport. To address this limitation, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) p&#8208;n heterojunction CuS&#8208;Bi2WO6 (CS&#8208;BWO) with highly connected and matched interfacial lattices was designed via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal tandem synthesis strategy. The integration of CuS with BWO created a robust interface electric &#64257;eld and provided fast charge transfer channels due to the work function difference, as well as highly connected and matched interfacial lattices. The p&#8208;n heterojunction&#160;promoted&#160;electron transfer from the Cu to Bi sites, leading to coordination of Bi sites with high electronic density and low oxidation state. The Bi sites in BWO nanosheets facilitated the adsorption and activation of CO2, and generation of high&#8208;coverage key intermediate b&#8208;CO32&#8208;, while broad light&#8208;harvesting CuS (CS)&#160;provide abundant photoinduced electrons that were injected into the conduction band of BWO for CO2 photoreduction reaction. Remarkably, the p&#8208;n heterojunction CS&#8208;BWO exhibited CO and CH4 yields of 135.7 and 62.5 &#181;mol g&#8208;1, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of CS, BWO, and physical mixture CS&#8208;BWO nanosheets. This work provided an innovative design strategy for developing high&#8208;activity heterojunction photocatalyst for converting CO2&#160;into value&#8208;added solar fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organometallic Umpolung Approach for Iron&#8208;Mediated Propargylic C&#8211;H Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of propargyl ethers is an efficient way to access a variety of pharmaceuticals and natural products. However, direct etherification of simple alkynes via propargylic C&#8211;H activation remains largely underreported, while propargylic substitution of prefunctionalized alkyne starting materials remains the dominant method for the synthesis of propargyl ethers. Herein, we report an organometallic umpolung approach for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H propargylic etherification. The stepwise iron&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H activation followed by mild oxidative functionalization enables the first use of unadorned alkynes to preferentially couple with alcohols for the efficient synthesis of synthetically important propargylic ethers with excellent functional group compatibility, chemoselectivity and regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO2 electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni SAC featuring axial Br coordination at NiN4Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co&#8208;doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr&#8208;assisted confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy. The Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO&gt; 97%) over the current density range of 50 to 350 mA cm&#8722;2 in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66 &#177; 0.2 V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over an 85&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial&#8208;scale applications. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the coordination and doping of Br enhance the intrinsic activity but also highlighted that the unique pore structure improves mass transfer efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrothermal Conversion of Methane to Methanol at Room&#160;Temperature with Phosphotungstic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol frequently require the use of noble metal catalysts or flammable H2&#8208;O2 mixtures. While electrochemical methods enhance safety and may avoid the use of noble metals, these processes suffer from low yields due to limited current density and/or low selectivity. Here, we design an electrothermal process to conduct aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O2 to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45 [[EQUATION]] with approximately 20.3% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90 [[EQUATION]] catalytic activity, over 74.3% methanol selectivity, and 10 hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in&#8208;situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

While electrochemical methods enhance safety and may avoid the use of noble metals, these processes suffer from low yields due to limited current density and/or low selectivity. Here, we design an electrothermal process to conduct aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O2 to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45 [[EQUATION]] with approximately 20.3% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90 [[EQUATION]] catalytic activity, over 74.3% methanol selectivity, and 10 hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in-situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo- and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in the geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factors for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8208;C coupling. At &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of &#8208;10.8 mA cm&#8208;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8208;C coupling efficiency.</dc:description>

At -1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of -10.8 mA cm-2.

         <title>Printing Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy for Microvasculature using Degradable DNA Biolubricant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microvasculature is essential for the continued function of cells in tissue and is fundamental in the fields of tissue engineering, organ repair and drug screening. However, the fabrication of microvasculature is still challenging using existing strategies. Here, we developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature, which eliminates the need for a subsequent cell seeding process and the associated deficiencies. Utilizing the shear&#8208;thinning property of DNA hydrogels as a novel sacrificial, cell&#8208;laden biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8208;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature, breaking the limit of 100 &#956;m. To our best knowledge, this is the smallest endothelialized microvasculature that has ever been bioprinted so far. In addition, the self&#8208;healing property of DNA hydrogels allows the creation of continuous branched structures. This strategy provides a new platform for constructing complex hierarchical vascular networks and offers new opportunity towards engineering thick tissues. The extremely low volume of sacrificial biolubricant paves the way for DNA hydrogels to be used in practical tissue engineering applications. The high&#8208;resolution bioprinting technique also exhibits great potential for printing lymphatics, retinas and neural networks in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A Piezocatalysis Strategy to Enable Efficient Redox in Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezocatalysis is considered to be a favorable catalytic technology by utilizing external mechanical stimulation to promote the specific redox reactions. The application of piezocatalysis in batteries is promising but faces formidable challenges. Herein, the operation principles of piezocatalysis were successfully demonstrated by constructing a solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se (S) battery model with interfacial stress accumulation. Lead zirconate titanate with an ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient was applied as the piezoelectric catalyst. The uniformity of the dipole orientation in materials was essential for achieving piezocatalysis in batteries. The accumulated high&#8208;stress converts to piezopotential for catalyzing most reaction processes in batteries, while the rapid stress change prevents the internal charge reorganization, ensuring continuous efficient catalysis. The internal stress change alters the internal polarisation strength, driving excess screening charge to participate in the electrochemical reaction. Under piezocatalysis, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se batteries exhibited a initial discharge capacity of 670.9 mAh g&#8722;1 (99.4% of the theoretical value) at 0.1C, and Li&#8722;S batteries showed a capacity of 1463 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2C, which was still maintained up to 1084 mAh g&#8722;1 at an elevated rate of 0.5C. This piezocatalysis strategy provides a strong theoretical basis and design specification for enhancing Li&#8722;Se (S) cell reaction kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Topology of Gemini&#8208;shaped Hexagonal Heterojunction for Efficient Stereoconvergent Transformation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advances in the combination of kinetic resolution and racemization for efficient stereoconvergent transformation, the poor stability and limited reaction activities of the products restrict their wide application in industrial production. To overcome these problems, Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;heterojunctions for one&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers were designed via hydrogen&#8208;bonding adhesion by racemization catalyst 1&#160;and kinetic resolution 2&#160;in this work. The polymers from the assembly of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons exhibit rapid catalytic behaviour with efficient selectivity for the desired configuration in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols with contiguous stereocenters through dynamic kinetic resolution for the nanoscale heterojunctions of dissimilar catalysts. Among them, the developed 2D polymers gave outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities (&gt;99% ee, 20:1 dr) through the cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts. The heterojunctions varying dimensions and distances of dissimilar catalysts provide new insight for increasing the enantioselectivity of chiral organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and Recyclable Copper Nanoclusters with Exposed Active Sites for Broad&#8208;Scope Protosilylation in Open Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advances in cluster&#8208;based catalysis for organic synthesis, the substrate scope of reactions catalyzed by metal nanoclusters is typically not superior to previously established catalytic systems. Herein, we develop new atomically precise copper nanoclusters for protosilylation, with scope expanding to alkenes and simple enynes that were not suitable for prior synthetic methodologies with traditional copper complexes. The involvement of a second copper center in the metal kernel during the migratory insertion step is thought to be responsible for the expanded scope. In addition, the reaction is highly compatible with water and can be carried out in open air rather than under inert gas protection. Mechanistic studies suggest that the cluster&#8208;catalyzed protosilylation proceeds in the absence of silyl radicals. The current findings demonstrate the potential of using metal nanoclusters for practical and sustainable chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature magnetocapacitance spanning 97 K hysteresis in molecular material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic capacitor, as a new type of device, has broad application prospects in fields such as magnetic field sensing, magnetic storage, magnetic field control, power electronics and so on. Traditional magnetic capacitors are mostly assembled by magnetic and capacitive materials. Magnetic capacitor made of a single material with intrinsic properties is very rare. This intrinsic property is magnetocapacitance (MC). The studies on MC effect have mainly focused on metal oxides so far. No study was reported in molecular materials. Herein, two complexes: (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB = (2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) are reported. There exist strong H&#8208;Br and Br&#8208;Br interactions and other weak interactions in complex 2, so the phase transition energy barrier is high, resulting in the widest thermal hysteresis loop on a molecular level to date. Furthermore, complexes 1 and 2 show large MC parameters of 0.247 and 1.614, respectively, which is the first time to observe MC effect in molecular material.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Regeneration of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Catalysis Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) endows NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the frequent evolution and sluggish regeneration of lattice oxygen intensify the dissolution of active species. Herein, we overcome this challenge by constructing the NiFe hydroxide/Ni4Mo alloy (NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo) heterojunction electrocatalyst, featuring the Ni4Mo alloy as the oxygen pump to provide oxygenous intermediates and electrons for NiFe&#8208;LDH. The released lattice oxygen can be timely offset by the oxygenous species during the LOM process, balancing the regeneration of lattice oxygen and assuring the enhancement of the durability. In consequence, the durability of NiFe&#8208;LDH is significantly enhanced after the modification of Ni4Mo with an impressively durability for over 60 h, much longer than that of NiFe&#8208;LDH counterpart with only 10 h. In&#8208;situ spectra and first&#8208;principle simulations reveal that the adsorption of OH&#8722; is significantly strengthened owing to the introduction of Ni4Mo, ensuring the rapid regeneration of lattice oxygen. Moreover, NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) presents an impressive durability for over 150 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. The oxygen pump strategy opens opportunities to balance the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, enhancing the durability of efficient OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200&#8197;nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>

A NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH photocatalyst showed impressive infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity at &#955;=1200&#8197;nm (CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;%) and good stability over 50 re&#8208;use cycles. In situ DRIFTs, fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and DFT calculations showed that compressed anionic Ru complexes in LDH interlayers induced a dual charge redistribution phenomenon, narrowing the band gap (0.89&#8197;eV) in the hybrid photocatalyst system to enable efficient infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;% under 1200&#8197;nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98&#8197;eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200&#8197;nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores a unique co&#8208;functionalization approach using ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) and nanoparticles (RuNP) to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of crystalline red phosphorus. Employing &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221;&#8208;inspired tactics, the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 combats defect&#8208;induced charge deep trapping and fosters RuNP growth, forming effective charge transfer interfaces. This research illustrates the transformative impact of metal atom pre&#8208;anchoring in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Crystalline red phosphorus (CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP (Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 (analogous to the &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; principle) in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of active charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts available. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Low&#8208;Nuclearity Cluster Catalysts for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based MOFs with unstable Cu coordination centers is electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported onto the remaining MOFs with 3D coordination bonds by the pore space limitation. The synergistic effect of Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8722;*CO coupling generation *CH2CHO species, leading to excellently electrocatalytic CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH performance.







Abstract
It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular and efficient enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been developed through the sequential chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed Povarov reaction and subsequent aromatizations. With the excellent compatibility of the Povarov reaction and the development of distinct aromatization methods, a wide range of structurally diverse novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes were produced with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.

         <title>Designed Synthesis of an Aluminum Molecular Ring Based Rotaxane and Polyrotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multisite and adaptive Al8 macrocycle demonstrates a groundbreaking capacity to sequentially encapsulate molecules, complexes, and polymers through &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; interactions. This progressive encapsulation culminates in the formation of an endless polyrotaxane structure, &#8220;the Al8 rock sugar gourd&#8221;. These distinct host&#8211;guest interactions bestow the Al8 macrocycles with customizable optical&#8208;limiting functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

The V&#8208;PBA cathode, prepared by in situ growth and conversion strategy, with eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose and 3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2 could maintain 55&#8201;% of the highest discharge specific capacity after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a new strategy to prepare pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction to enhance the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current density for industrialization prospects.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+, and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5&#8197;M ZnSO4+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55&#8201;% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Material with Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Efficient Organic Afterglow Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) in a molecule leads to a long OURTP lifetime up to 251&#8197;ms and a high total quantum efficiency over 80&#8201;%. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQEtotal) of ~12&#8201;%, OURTP efficiency (EQEOURTP) of 3.11&#8201;% and electroluminescent lifetime up to 201&#8197;ms, respectively.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one&#8208;dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT&#8208;featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77&#8201;% in solution and long&#8208;lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251&#8197;ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85&#8201;% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2&#8197;s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP&#8208;OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12&#8201;% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11&#8201;%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP&#8208;OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.

         <title>A Rhodamine&#8208;Spiropyran Conjugate Empowering Tunable Mechanochromism in Polymers under Multiple Stimuli</title>

Conjugating rhodamine and spiropyran rings through a xanthene scaffold offers a new &#960;&#8208;fused mechanochromophore Rh&#8722;SP. High&#8208;contrast and broad&#8208;spectrum mechanochromism in Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;crosslinked elastomers corresponding to different (de)activated states are illustrated, highlighting the power of this mechanophore design in developing polymeric materials with mechanochromic programmability and recognition of multiple stimuli.







Abstract
Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force&#8208;responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single&#8208;component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi&#8208;modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh&#8722;SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits. The mechanochromic behaviors of the Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;linked polymers under sonication and compression are thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in force and the light&#8208;controlled relaxation process. Non&#8208;sequential ring&#8208;opening of the two subunits under force is identified, endowing high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism. Light&#8208;induced differential ring&#8208;closing reactions of the two subunits, together with the acidichromism of the SP moiety, are employed to engineer elastomers with programmable and wide&#8208;spectrum colors. Our work presents an effective strategy for highly appreciable and regulable mechanochromic functionality, and also provides new insights into the rupture mechanisms of &#960;&#8208;fused mechanophores, as well as how the stimuli history controls stress accumulation in polymers.

         <title>Recyclable Polythioesters and Poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s via Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Polymerization of Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens a new paradigm for polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride based on a S&#8208;to&#8208;N shift reaction, producing unexpected recyclable polythioesters and unprecedent poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s.







Abstract
Polythioesters (PTEs) are emerging sustainable polymers for their degradability and recyclability. However, low polymerizability of monomers and extensive side reactions often hampered the polymerization process. Moreover, copolymers containing both thioester and other types of functional groups in the backbone are highly desirable but rarely accomplished owing to several synthetic challenges. Here, we report the ring&#8208;opening cascade polymerization (ROCAP) of N&#8208;(2&#8208;(acetylthio)ethyl)&#8208;glycine N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (TE&#8208;NCA) to afford recyclable PTEs and unprecedented poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s (P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s) in a controlled manner. By developing appropriated carboxylic acid&#8208;tertiary amine dual catalysts, intramolecular S&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift is coupled into the ROCAP process of TE&#8208;NCA to yield products with dispersity below 1.10, molecular weight (Mn) up to 84.5&#8197;kDa, and precisely controlled ratio of thioester to peptoids. Random copolymerization of sarcosine NCA (Sar&#8208;NCA) and TE&#8208;NCA gives thioester&#8208;embedded polysarcosine with facile backbone degradation while maintaining the water solubility. This work represents a paradigm shift for the ROP of NCAs, enriches the realm of cascade polymerizations, and provides a powerful synthetic approach to functional PTEs and P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s that are otherwise difficult or impossible to make.

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A planar&#8208;structured dinuclear cobalt(II) complex exhibits an indirect synergistic catalysis effect between two Co(II) sites for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, with TON and TOF values of 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, which is 8.6&#8208;fold improvement than that of the corresponding mononuclear counterpart.







Abstract
Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8722;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.

         <title>Redox and Kinetic Properties of Composition&#8208;Dependent Active Sites in Copper&#8208;Exchanged Chabazite for Direct Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity tests and advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques are employed to elucidate the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites with varying Cu loading and Si/Al ratio and its influence on CH4 partial oxidation to CH3OH. An improved CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency of materials containing primarily monomeric Cu(II) active sites in contrast to zeolites with a significant fraction of dimeric Cu(II) centers has been found.







Abstract
The CH4 oxidation performance of Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet&#8208;visible, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;O)]2+ moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.

This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzocoronene core&#8208;expanded graphdiyne nanosheets with a sixfold symmetry were synthesized on Au(111) via dehydrogenative coupling reactions of ethyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene. Their chemical and electronic configurations were thoroughly investigated using scanning probe microscopy, providing a band gap (2.8&#8197;eV) of a single&#8208;layer graphdiyne&#8208;like nanosheet.







Abstract
Thermally&#8208;induced dehydrogenative coupling of polyphenylenes on metal surfaces is an important technique to synthesize 

&#960;

 ${\pi }$



&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstruction of COFs into separation membranes: A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and dissociated into high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Reconstruction of COF nanosheets gives an ordered and defect&#8208;free membrane. The synthesized membrane exhibits superior CO2/N2 separation performance of high selectivity and large permeance owing to optimized microstructures.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid enantiomers (L/D&#8208;UG) are designed to self&#8208;assemble into vesicles and 2D nanocrystals with different chirality and curvature, which showed differentiated protein adsorption and subsequent osteogenesis. L&#8208;2D nanocrystal exhibits as one of the most effective materials to promote bone regeneration.







Abstract
Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures&#8217; interaction with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG molecules can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins, determined by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrochemiluminescence for Imaging the Corrosion of Protective Coating of Metal and Quantitative Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galvanized iron was exploited as both power source and electrodes to achieve self&#8208;powered electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for the first time. The elimination of external power source enables protective coating corrosion imaging using a smartphone. This self&#8208;powered ECL also enables ECL analysis and holds great promise for corrosion imaging and analytical applications.







Abstract
In almost all electrochemical systems for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis, electrodes are connected with an external power source, either directly or via wireless energy transfer circuit. That is inconvenient and makes some applications impossible. Herein, we use galvanized iron with two different metals as both power source and electrodes to achieve a self&#8208;powered ECL and exploit ECL for the imaging of the corrosion of protective coating of widely used metal (e.g. galvanized iron) for the first time. The self&#8208;powered ECL enables the visualization of the deterioration of galvanic coating on iron using a smartphone and the detection of ascorbic acid with a linear range of 0.5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.31&#8197;&#956;M. The devices based on self&#8208;powered approach do not require external power supply, thus effectively reducing their volume and cost. The self&#8208;powered ECL holds great promise for metal corrosion imaging and analytical applications.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Chemical Self&#8208;Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries with High Charging and Discharging Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;charging zinc ion battery system for the first time, the photo&#8208;assisted process during chemical self&#8208;charging promotes the transfer of electrons from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction, and enables it to exhibit excellent performance, providing a new strategy for zinc ion battery in energy storage.







Abstract
Chemical self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95&#8197;V within 3&#8197;hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Emissive B&#8211;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Extension in Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of B&#8211;N Lewis pair functionalized anthracene into a vinylene&#8208;linked dimer and polymer leads to selective extension of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), thus significantly lowering the band gap, shifting the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region, and modulating the self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward oxygen and release of singlet oxygen from the corresponding endoperoxides.







Abstract
Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8211;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the &#960;&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8&#8197;eV for the dimer and 1.7&#8197;eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731&#8197;nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7&#8201;%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.

         <title>Exploring Geometric Chirality in Nanocrystals for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of geometric chiral effect was explored to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution using a chiral composite of geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) and C3N4 nanosheets. The chiral Au NPs enable efficient charge carrier separation and high&#8208;activity facets, boosting performance over achiral counterparts and resulting in a quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance was also revealed.







Abstract
Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Triaza[5]triangulene through Cyclodehydrogenation and its Magnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triaza[5]triangulene, containing three graphitic nitrogen atoms, and its derivatives were successfully synthesized through cyclodehydrogenation and C&#8722;N bond cleavage from 4,8,12&#8208;Tris(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,8,12&#8208;triazatriangulenium on Au(111). Their chemical structures and spin states were investigated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved STM, STS, and DFT calculations at low temperature.







Abstract
Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8722;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.

Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8722;B and C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization of PolyBorylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents site&#8208;, and stereoselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed strategies for synthesizing stereodefined polysubstituted alkenes using poly&#8208;boron&#8208;containing alkenes. Four protocols were developed to generate reactive alkenyl&#8208;Rh and aryl&#8208;Rh intermediates, enabling diverse stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formations. The study introduces Z&#8722;Rh species, facilitating stereoselective coupling reactions and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult. In this regard, numerous synthetic methodologies have been developed to construct carbon&#8211;carbon bonds with regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, enabling the predictable and efficient synthesis of stereodefined alkenes. In fact, an appealing alternative approach for accessing challenging stereodefined alkene molecular frameworks could involve the sequential selective activation and cross&#8208;coupling of strong bonds instead of conventional C&#8722;C bond formation. In this study, we introduce a series of programmed site&#8208; and stereoselective strategies that capitalizes on the versatile reactivity of readily accessible polymetalloid alkenes (i.e. polyborylated alkenes), through a tandem cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which is catalyzed by an organometallic Rh&#8208;complex to produce complex molecular scaffolds. By merging selective C&#8722;B and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization, we achieve the in situ generation of polyfunctional C(sp2)&#8208;nucleophilic intermediates. These species can be further modified by selective coupling reactions with various C&#8208;based electrophiles, enabling the formation of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond for the generation of even more complex molecular architectures using the readily available starting polyborylated&#8208;alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide insight into the origins of the stereoselectivities and C&#8722;H activation via a 1,4&#8208;Rh migration process.

         <title>Switchable Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Pseudo&#8208;Stereodivergence in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereodivergent cycloadditions of allenes have been developed. These mechanistically distinct cycloadditions enabled to rapidly access structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazine species with high efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a strategy enabling triple switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereodivergence in newly developed palladium&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of allenes. An asymmetric pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent cycloaddition of allenes bearing a primary leaving group at the &#945;&#8208;position, where a dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of racemic unactivated allenes was the enantio&#8208;determining step, is realized, providing four stereoisomers [(Z,R), (Z,S), (E,S), and (E,R)] containing a di&#8208;substituted alkene scaffold and a stereogenic center. By tuning reaction conditions, a mechanistically distinctive cycloaddition is uncovered selectively with the same set of substrates. By switching the position of the leaving group of allenes, a cycloaddition involving an intermolecular O&#8208;attack is disclosed. Diverse mechanisms of the cycloaddition reactions of allenes enable rapid access to structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high efficiency and selectivity.

Core&#8208;shell MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with highly adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure were constructed by innovatively exploiting C&#8722;C linkage, demonstrating much better degradation performance than their parent components, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Moreover, the in situ grown MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V films exhibited broad&#8208;spectrum, reusable and significantly enhanced removal capabilities for diverse pollutants in river water by solar drive.







Abstract
Diversifying the connecting junctions will be feasible for the controllable collaboration of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to rationally design multifunction&#8208;integrated heterostructures with enhanced performance, yet it is in the nascent stage. Herein, by intelligently exploiting the polymerization of vinyl group, C&#8722;C bond is innovatively introduced to construct the core&#8211;shell MOF@COF heterostructures with adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure. The unique structure endows prepared C&#8722;C&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with more superior visible&#8208;light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation capability, leading to significantly higher photocatalytic activity and faster degradation rate than pristine MIL&#8208;68&#8208;C=Cs, COF&#8722;V, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Further, the customized MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V is in situ grown as reusable films with dramatically boosted performance under ambient conditions, which realize the highly efficient degradation of tetracycline within 15&#8197;min (96.5&#8201;%), rhodamine 6G within 25&#8197;min (97.6&#8201;%), and phenol within 40&#8197;min (95.3&#8201;%) by solar drive. This work exhibits the distinctive advantages of C&#8722;C junction in the MOF@COF construction, and highlights the application prospect of rational&#8208;designed heterostructure in the treatment of persistent organic pollutants.

A practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination, and arylation macrocyclization is reported, which provided a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. A combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide, which demonstrated a potential efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of SIRT3.







Abstract
The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8722;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2&#8201;a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;Electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO2RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co&#8208;produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR system exhibits high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Dynamic Proton Bridges Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual&#8208;sites to back&#8208;donate electrons to the &#960;x* and &#960;y* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N2), achieving exceptional N2 fixation activity. This discovery paves the way for efficient electrocatalysts for activating inert molecules.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH3) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool. In situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the In&#8722;S polarization pair acts as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites, polarizing the N&#8801;N bond by concurrently back&#8208;donating electrons to both the &#960;x* and &#960;y* orbitals of N2, thereby overcoming the significant band gap limitations, while inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair. As a result, the O&#8722;In&#8722;S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3&#8197;V, with an optimal NH3 yield rate of 80.07&#177;4.25&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and an FE of 38.01&#177;2.02&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Concentration Distribution in Sb&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoarrays for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D coral&#8208;like alloy nanoarray featuring decreasing Sb and increasing Cu concentrations from bottom to top has been established. The former endows high capacity, while the latter acts as a protective layer maintaining high stability at the electrolyte/electrode interface. It also facilitates smooth distribution and release of stress, thereby exhibiting superior cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability for sodium storage.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral&#8208;like Sb&#8722;Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb&#8208;rich bottom and a Cu&#8208;rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder&#8208;type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as&#8208;developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), stable cycling (89&#8201;% retention over 120&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C), and superior rate capability (354&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C). The concentration dual&#8208;gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy&#8208;type materials for
SIBs.

         <title>Thermal Effect Management via Entropy Variation Strategy to Improve the Catalyst Stability in Acetylene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provided an entropy variation strategy to realize thermal effect management and developed a long&#8208;term stable CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation. Its essence is that the heat sensitive but non active Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion via capturing and utilizing the reaction heat generated on the active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
The dynamic structure evolution of heterogeneous catalysts during reaction has gained great attention recently. However, controllably manipulating dynamic process and then feeding back catalyst design to extend the lifetime remains challenging. Herein, we proposed an entropy variation strategy to develop a dynamic CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst, in which the non&#8208;active Co nano&#8208;islands play a crucial role in controlling thermal effect via timely capturing and utilizing reaction heat generated on the adjacent active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, heat sensitive Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion during the reaction. Under such heat dissipation effect, the CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst exhibited 95.7&#8201;% ethylene selectivity and amazing long&#8208;term stability (&gt;530&#8197;h) in the typical exothermic acetylene hydrogenation. Aiming at cultivating it as a catalyst with promising industrial potential, we proposed a simple regeneration approach via an entropy decreasing process.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a deep&#8208;red emissive sulfur&#8208;doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.







Abstract
Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Helix&#8208;Sense&#8208;Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one&#8208;handed helicity&#8208;memorized polymers. The carboxy&#8208;bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co&#8208;assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy&#8208;bound helicity&#8208;memorized polymer self&#8208;assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co&#8208;assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of High&#8208;Rate Copper Electrochemical Machining in Nitrate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution mechanism of copper during high&#8208;rate electrochemical machining in nitrate electrolyte is investigated and proposed to change to overcome mass transport limitation. Prerequisites are derived from polarization measurements under various (hydrodynamic) conditions. A new complexation mechanism involving nitrate ions is proposed at overlimiting currents.







Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine based covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. They displayed superior H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in H2O and O2 under AM&#8197;1.5G through the combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.

         <title>Progressive Endergonic Synthesis of Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts Driven by Chemical Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going uphill. While most chemical reactions proceed towards equilibrium, we describe herein how to drive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions away from equilibrium (&#916;G &gt;0) using the hydration energy of carbodiimides. Our strategy yielded products up to 400&#8201;% of what thermodynamics would allow at equilibrium. Progressive accumulation upon repeated fueling cycles unlocks adaptive behaviors in chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light&#8208;harvesting and photoenergy applications.







Abstract
Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Topology-directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra-framework singlet-state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light-harvesting and photoenergy applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well-defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology-directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene-porphyrin alignment along the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; directions at a 1.5-nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti-AA stack along the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra-framework singlet-to-singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet-to-triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near-infrared regions for light emitting and photo-to-chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well-defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Coupling&#8208;Induced Assembly Strategy for Constructing Artificial Shell on Mitochondria in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently cross&#8208;linked artificial shells with multiple binding sites were constructed in situ on mitochondria by a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy. Under ultrasonic (US) irradiation, a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was generated, which acted on the neighboring mitochondrial membranes and thus induced mitochondrial apoptosis.







Abstract
The strategy of in vivo self&#8208;assembly has been developed for improved enrichment and long&#8208;term retention of anticancer drug in tumor tissues. However, most self&#8208;assemblies with non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions are susceptible to complex physiological environments, leading to weak stability and loss of biological function. Here, we develop a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy to generate covalently crosslinked nanofibers, which is applied for in situ constructing artificial shell on mitochondria. The oxidation&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugate P1 is synthesized, which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Under the oxidative microenvironment of mitochondria, the coupling of thiols in P1 causes the formation of dimers, which is further ordered and stacked into crosslinked nanofibers. As a result, the artificial shell is constructed on the mitochondria efficiently through multivalent cooperative interactions due to the increased binding sites. Under ultrasound (US) irradiation, the porphyrin molecules in the shell produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act on the adjacent mitochondrial membrane, exhibiting ~2&#8208;fold higher antitumor activity than nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mitochondria&#8208;targeted CIA strategy provides a novel perspective on improved sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and shows potential applications in antitumor therapies.

Abstract
We report a highly crystalline self&#8208;assembled multilayer (SAMUL) that is fundamentally different from the conventional monolayer or disordered bilayer used for hole&#8208;extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SAMUL can be easily formed on ITO substrate to establish better surface coverage to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. A detailed structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of molecules used for SAMUL is established through a systematic study of their crystallinity, molecular packing, and hole&#8208;transporting properties. These SAMULs are rationally optimized by varying their molecular structures and deposition methods through thermal evaporation or spin&#8208;coating for fabricating PSCs. The CbzNaphPPA&#8208;based SAMUL was chosen for fabricating inverted PSCs due to it exhibiting the highest crystallinity and hole mobility which is derived from the ordered H&#8208;aggregation. This resulted in a remarkably high fill factor of 86.45&#8201;%, which enables a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07&#8201;% to be achieved along with excellent device stability (94&#8201;% of its initial PCE retained after continuous operation for 1200&#8197;h under 1&#8208;sun irradiation at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, a record&#8208;high PCE of 23.50&#8201;% could be achieved by adopting a thermally evaporated SAMUL.

         <title>Achieving Record C2H2 Packing Density for Highly Efficient C2H2/C2H4 Separation with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by a Scalable Synthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that achieves a record acetylene packing density, which is pivotal for the highly efficient purification of ethylene. The synthesis of this material is readily scalable to the kilogram level using pure water as solvent, thereby establishing it as a leading candidate for practical industrial applications.







Abstract
Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1&#8201;%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols. Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 0.01&#8197;bar through high affinity towards C2H2. DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal the synergistic binding mechanism through pore confinement and the oxygen sites in pore wall. The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Qst) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space&#8208;time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1 has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.

         <title>Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupled Dendritic Molecule Doping: General Approach to Activate Commercial Polymers into Harsh Condition&#8208;Tolerant Multi&#8208;Reusable Strong Supramolecular Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy is proposed to activate commercial polymers into a new family of harsh condition&#8208;tolerant, multi&#8208;reusable and strong supramolecular adhesives by simple physical doping of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule (named M4C8OH). Such M4C8OH doping overcomes commonly&#8208;seen trade&#8208;off between cohesion and interface adhesion. The rigid&#8208;flexible dendritic structure, branch number, and OH&#8208;terminated alkyl chain length for molecule dopants are key structural factors for superior adhesion properties.







Abstract
Developing functional adhesives combining strong adhesion, good recyclability and diverse harsh&#8208;condition adaptability is a grand challenge. Here, we introduce a general dendritic molecule doping strategy to activate commercial polymers into a new family of supramolecular adhesives integrating high adhesion strength, ultralow temperature, water resistant and multi&#8208;reusable properties. Our method involves rational design of a new rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule&#8212;M4C8OH as a versatile dopant, while simple M4C8OH doping into commercial polymers can modulate internal and external non&#8208;covalent interaction to enable H&#8208;bonding enhanced interchain cross&#8208;linking for tough cohesion along with enhanced interphase interaction. This endows 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% M4C8OH&#8208;doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL&#8208;M4C8OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87&#8197;times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths of PCL&#8208;M4C8OH on polymethyl methacrylate at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58&#8197;MPa&#8212;1.9 and 2.3&#8197;times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives. PCL&#8208;M4C8OH also displays markedly&#8208;improved multi&#8208;usability and tolerance against ultralow temperature and diverse wet environments. Mechanism studies reveal the crucial role of M4C8OH molecular structures toward superior adhesion. Our method can be expanded to other polymer matrices, yielding diverse new supramolecular adhesives.

     alt="Rigid-Flexible Coupled Dendritic Molecule Doping: General Approach to Activate Commercial Polymers into Harsh Condition-Tolerant Multi-Reusable Strong Supramolecular Adhesives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general strategy is proposed to activate commercial polymers into a new family of harsh condition-tolerant, multi-reusable and strong supramolecular adhesives by simple physical doping of rigid-flexible coupled dendritic molecule (named M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH). Such M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH doping overcomes commonly-seen trade-off between cohesion and interface adhesion. The rigid-flexible dendritic structure, branch number, and OH-terminated alkyl chain length for molecule dopants are key structural factors for superior adhesion properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing functional adhesives combining strong adhesion, good recyclability and diverse harsh-condition adaptability is a grand challenge. Here, we introduce a general dendritic molecule doping strategy to activate commercial polymers into a new family of supramolecular adhesives integrating high adhesion strength, ultralow temperature, water resistant and multi-reusable properties. Our method involves rational design of a new rigid-flexible coupled dendritic molecule&#8212;M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH as a versatile dopant, while simple M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH doping into commercial polymers can modulate internal and external non-covalent interaction to enable H-bonding enhanced interchain cross-linking for tough cohesion along with enhanced interphase interaction. This endows 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH-doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL-M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87&#8197;times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths of PCL-M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;OH on polymethyl methacrylate at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58&#8197;MPa&#8212;1.9 and 2.3&#8197;times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives.

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
By integrating mixed&#8208;valent redox metal center, charge/energy donor and photo&#8208;active center in one interface, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;amplified sensitivity is developed for precisely distinguishing the negative and positive acid phosphatase (ACP, prostate cancer marker), which exhibits bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence (&#8220;leap&#8221; response from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221;) at ACP threshold.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9&#8197;U&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive, and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulator&#8208;transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]&#8208;[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8593;a1g&#8593; eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;a1g&#8593;&#8595; eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cationic rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed, and the first example of rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;diarylcarbenes has been realized. The computational study indicates that the combination of a stereochemically favored &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction and a rotation&#8208;restricted conformation is crucial to the reaction enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.

Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation-restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Ion Pairing and Transport in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Reversible Lithium Metal Anodes at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with the desolvation barrier, bulk transport properties also determine Li deposition behavior at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The combination of moderately weak solvent and low viscosity diluent allows for low desolvation energy and high Li+ transference number while maintaining adequate ion conduction and diffusion. Therefore, exceptional Li metal Coulombic efficiency at extremely low temperatures is achieved.







Abstract
Coulombic efficiency of over 99&#8201;% is rarely achieved for Li metal anode below &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, hindering the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries under extreme conditions. Herein, limiting factors for Li metal reversibility are investigated utilizing ether&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes of different solvent&#8208;diluent combinations. We find that along with the desolvation barrier, bulk ion transport properties including ionic conductivity, transference number, and diffusivity are also crucial factors for low&#8208;temperature Li deposition behavior. Superior Li metal reversibility was observed within the combination of the solvent with moderately weak solvating power and the diluent with minimal viscosity, highlighting the role of ion transport and the necessity for a trade&#8208;off with desolvation. The optimized electrolyte composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, methyl n&#8208;propyl ether, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether delivers exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.34&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 98.96&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C under a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, Li||LiCoO2 (2.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cells demonstrate impressive reversible capacity and cycling stability at these temperatures. This work sheds light on the less&#8208;recognized relevance of bulk ion transport to low&#8208;temperature performance and provides guidelines for the electrolyte design of Li metal batteries operating in cold environments.

         <title>A Cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H Annulation Involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;Palladacycle Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles formed by alkene&#8208; or indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to access tricyclic and pentacyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can also be used to construct a tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving C,C&#8208;palladacycle intermediates provides a unique platform for developing novel reactions. However, the vast majority of studies have been limited to the transformations of C(aryl),C&#8208;palladacycles. In sharp contrast, catalytic reactions involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles have rarely been reported. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides undergo intramolecular Heck/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation to generate C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles, which can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to afford tricyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, this strategy can also be applied to indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides to construct pentacyclic fused pyridinediones via suquential Heck dearomatization/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. Notably, the removal of &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids in the reaction of alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can build an interesting tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate that five&#8208;membered C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles serve as the key intermediates. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway.

Confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with copper single atoms (CuSAs) inside defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals is achieved by the straightforward method of low&#8208;temperature thermolysis. The prepared composite CuSAs@PCN@UiO, combining the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis, exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added fuels displays an attractive scenario to enhance energy supply and reduce global warming. We report herein the confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with Cu single atoms (CuSAs) inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which combines the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) to achieve high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. A series of spectral studies displays the formation of CuSAs@PCN inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, the ternary composite shows an excellent photocatalytic turnover frequency of 4.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type&#8208;II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH3OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for CO2 conversion to fuels at atomic scale.

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions.

&lt;p&gt;In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano-ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron-based nano-ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;-commo-bis[closo-1,2-dicarba-3-cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), and halogenated closo-dodecarboranes (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super-chaotropic nano-ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano-ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano-ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron-based nano-ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol is widely used in chemotherapy but couldn't be orally administrated. In this protocol, a series of benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound 16&#8201;c was identified as potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16&#8201;c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16&#8201;c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16&#8201;c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.

Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a "simple" yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300&#160;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>

Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

Coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels enable fast two&#8208;photon subtractive 3D microprinting and laser&#8208;guided cell outgrowth on demand, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;applications, such as spatiotemporal tissue engineering.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controlled two&#8208;photon photodegradation of hydrogels has gained increasing attention for high&#8208;precision subtractive tissue engineering. However, conventional photolabile hydrogels often have poor efficiency upon two&#8208;photon excitation in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and thus require high laser dosage that may compromise cell activity. As a result, high&#8208;speed two&#8208;photon hydrogel erosion in the presence of cells remains challenging. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of efficient coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels to overcome these limitations. A set of photolabile coumarin&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol linkers are synthesized through a Passerini multicomponent reaction. After mixing these linkers with thiolated hyaluronic acid, semi&#8208;synthetic photodegradable hydrogels are formed in situ via Michael addition crosslinking. The efficiency of photodegradation in these hydrogels is significantly higher than that in nitrobenzyl counterparts upon two&#8208;photon irradiation at 780&#8197;nm. A complex microfluidic network mimicking the bone microarchitecture is successfully fabricated in preformed coumarin hydrogels at high speeds of up to 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low laser dosage down to 10&#8197;mW. Further, we demonstrate fast two&#8208;photon printing of hollow microchannels inside a hydrogel to spatiotemporally direct cell migration in 3D. Collectively, these hydrogels may open new avenues for fast laser&#8208;guided tissue fabrication at high spatial resolution.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial enzymes that operate with pnictogen bonds or &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in general are introduced: Transfer hydrogenation of quinolines accelerates with biotinylated pnictogen&#8208;bonding cofactors and their interfacing with streptavidin and mutants, shows saturation behavior with transition&#8208;state recognition three orders of magnitude beyond substrate recognition, and the emergence of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The objective of this study was to create artificial enzymes that capitalize on pnictogen bonding, a &#963;&#8208;hole interaction that is essentially absent in biocatalysis. For this purpose, stibine catalysts were equipped with a biotin derivative and combined with streptavidin mutants to identify an efficient transfer hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a fluorogenic quinoline substrate. Increased catalytic activity from wild&#8208;type streptavidin to the best mutants coincides with the depth of the &#963; hole on the Sb(V) center, and the emergence of saturation kinetic behavior. Michaelis&#8211;Menten analysis reveals transition&#8208;state recognition in the low micromolar range, more than three orders of magnitude stronger than the millimolar substrate recognition. Carboxylates preferred by the best mutants contribute to transition&#8208;state recognition by hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairing and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with the emerging pyridinium product. The emergence of challenging stereoselectivity in aqueous systems further emphasizes compatibility of pnictogen bonding with higher order systems catalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unlikely Occurring Quadrangular Tube by Modulating Intramolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor with a central dibenzothiophene moiety, functionalized at the 3,7&#8208;positions with m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Combining this with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine at high concentrations produced a quadrangular tube, driven by intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions within the framework. This research highlights how modulating these forces can yield products previously deemed difficult or impossible to synthesize.







Abstract
One of the central focuses in self&#8208;assembly is precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. Trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7&#8208;positions are functionalized with two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.

The first phosphorus tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15) was obtained at high&#8208;pressure conditions. It features a three&#8208;dimensional network that exhibits PN6 octahedra and occupational disorder of P and Ta atoms visualized by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Mixed&#8208;valent Ta atoms result in metallic behavior with rather high resistivity.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis, crystal, and electronic structure, as well as the magnetic, and electric properties of the phosphorus&#8208;containing tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15). A high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C) of Ta3N5 and P3N5 with NH4F as a mineralizing agent yields the compound in the form of black, rod&#8208;shaped crystals. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure elucidation (space group C2/m (no. 12), a=16.202(3), b=2.9155(4), c=11.089(2)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=126.698(7)&#176;, Z=2) shows a network of face&#8208; and edge&#8208;sharing Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra that contains small vacant channels and PN6 octahedra strands. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals an unusual P/Ta disorder. Mixed&#8208;valent tantalum atoms exhibit interatomic distances similar to those in metallic tantalum, however, the electrical resistivity is quite high in the order of 101&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm. The density of states and the electron localization function indicate localized electrons in both covalent and ionic bonds between P/Ta and N atoms, combined with less localized electrons that do not contribute to interatomic bonds.

         <title>Copper(I) Catalysed Diboron(4) Reduction of Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new process for the deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is presented which uses copper(I) boryl complexes as highly productive catalysts and leverages the oxophilicity of boron as a thermodynamic driving force. Selective N&#8722;O bond activation of nitrous oxide is mediated by O&#8208;atom insertion into the metal&#8211;boron bond and turnover numbers over 800 can be achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. These reactions proceed under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8722;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt;800 can be achieved at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 1&#8197;bar N2O.

         <title>Electrolyte Composition&#8208;Dependent Product Selectivity in CO2 Reduction with a Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major product of electrochemical CO2 reduction on a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was found to switch from CO to formic acid upon electrolyte composition changing. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies indicates pathway steering by addition of extra proton source to the electrolyte.







Abstract
A copper porphyrin&#8208;derived metal&#8211;organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN&#8208;8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst&#8208;bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Wiring Covalent Organic Frameworks with Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing pyrrole units to pore walls followed by polymerization integrates spatially segregated six single file molecular wires in each pore of covalent organic frameworks. This wiring strategy offers a distinct electronic channel to enable electronic conduction along the z direction in the pores and to achieve an exceptional charge carrier stability and motion. This result highlights a new aspect and dimension for designing &#960; electronic organic materials based on molecular wiring.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers formed by linking organic units into periodically aligned skeletons and pores. Here we report a strategy for wiring these frameworks with conducting polymers via wall engineering and polymerization. We anchored each edge site with one pyrrole unit, which is densely packed along the z direction yet protruded from pore walls. This assembly enables the polymerization of pyrrole units to form polypyrrole and creates a new polypyrrole chain conformation. The resultant framework constitutes six single file polypyrrole chains in each pore and develop spatially segregated yet built&#8208;in single molecular wires with exceptional stable polarons. Hall effect measurements revealed that the materials are p&#8208;type semiconductors, increase conductivity by eight orders of magnitude compared to the pristine frameworks, and achieve a carrier mobility as large as 13.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results open an avenue to &#960; electronic frameworks by interlayer molecular wiring with conducting polymers.

         <title>Boosting Stimulated Emission via a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Co&#8208;Crystallization Approach in Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stimulated emission of molecular crystals was boosted via a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Structural and theoretical analyses revealed that the higher radiative transition rate and shorter excited&#8208;lifetime in the cocrystal lead to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, thereby facilitating the occurrence of stimulated emission.







Abstract
Stimulated emission (SE) of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule in solid state remains a significant challenge, mainly involving the mode of molecular stacking that invariably alters the photo&#8208;physical processes. Herein, we successfully realized stimulated emission in molecular crystals using a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, obtained from 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;p&#8208;cyanostyrylbenzene (CNDSB) and two types of co&#8208;formers, can boost stimulated emission and show decent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), whereas the parent CNDSB crystal is not SE&#8208;active. Crystal structural analysis demonstrated that the co&#8208;crystallization eliminated excimer formation. The resulting higher kr and shorter excited lifetime led to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, which benefited to the occurrence of ASE. Simultaneously, the uniaxial arrangements along the long axis of co&#8208;crystal together contributed to highly polarized emission. This system presents very rare evidence of boosting stimulated emission by binary co&#8208;crystallization, which enriches our insights into organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered vesicle microreactors with multiple functional proteins are constructed for bioenergy oscillation. Modulating biocatalytic reaction involved with each fuel (glucose, urea) generates and consumes protons respectively, which facilitates ATP synthesis and hydrolysis of ATPase in a tunable fashion.







Abstract
We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.

The deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines, is reported herein. Both silicon and boron groups from &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines were found useful in the context of further chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation. This protocol allows to reach various &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;,and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines from readily available amides.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Silylalkylamines and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines are versatile synthetic intermediates and attractive scaffolds found in pharmaceutical drugs and agrochemicals. Despite great progress on synthetic methods for preparation of &#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines or &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines, there are no general strategies for preparation of &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines and the reactivity has not been explored. Here we report deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines. The silicon and boron groups in &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines are found to be utilized to chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes is described that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles at the internal position, including primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and an ammonia surrogate. Two complementary set of conditions allow embedding both electronically activated and deactivated styrenes bearing diverse functional groups.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;7 Selective NH2 Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indole via directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS), enabled by identifying N&#8211;P(O)t&#8722;Bu2 (TBPO) as the directing group. Important features of this reaction include the broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, good functional groups tolerance, use of earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst and low catalyst loading, and the ease to scale up.







Abstract
7&#8208;Aminoindoles are important synthetic intermediates to a broad range of bioactive molecules. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH2 group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron&#8208;aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.

         <title>Unlocking Spatial Surface Energy in Porous Skeletons: a Pathway to Bridging Electronic Circuits from 2D to 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing maskless surface energy manipulation on a porous skeleton to guide PEDOT conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability, and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton. This facilitates transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations in electronic devices, whether rigid or flexible.







Abstract
Conventional approaches to creating high&#8208;resolution electric circuits face challenges such as the requirement for skilled personnel and expensive equipment. In response, we propose an innovative strategy that leverages a photochemically modified porous polymer skeleton for in&#8208;situ circuit fabrication. By developing maskless surface energy manipulation that guides PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton, enabling transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations. This process simplifies prototyping while significantly reducing costs and maintaining efficiency, promising advancements across various technological sectors.

This process simplifies prototyping while significantly reducing costs and maintaining efficiency, promising advancements across various technological sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Reversible Thermal/Electro&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesives via Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds and Ionic Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adhesive conducting elastomers are rising materials towards cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable and implantable soft electronics. Yet, engineering the conductive adhesives with robust and tunable interfacial bonding strength is still in its infancy stage. We herein identify a structurally novel supramolecular polymer scaffold, characterized by synergistic coexistence of hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions and electrostatic ionic junctions, endowing the robust and tunable elastic conducting adhesives with remarkable thermal/electro&#8208;responsive performance. H&#8208;bonding association and electrostatic interaction play orthogonal yet synergistic roles in the strong supramolecular adhesive formation, serving as the leveraging forces for opposing both cohesion and adhesion energy. To do so, six&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped random copolymers P(DAP&#8208;co&#8208;Thy&#8208;co&#8208;MBT)6 are strategically designed, bearing H&#8208;bonding PDAP (poly(diaminopyridine acrylamide)) and PThy (poly(thymine)) segments, which can form hetero&#8208;complementary DAP/Thy H&#8208;bonding association, along with conductive poly(ionic liquid)s segment: PMBT, (poly(1&#8208;[2&#8208;methacryloylethyl]&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)&#8208;sulfonamide)). DAP/Thy H&#8208;bonding association, along with electrostatic ionic interaction, can yield dual supramolecular forces crosslinked polymeric networks with robust cohesion energy. Moreover, coexistence of poly(ionic liquid)s can impact and interfere the configuration of H&#8208;bonding association, liberate more free DAP and Thy motifs to form H&#8208;bonds towards substrate, affording strong surface adhesion in a synergistic manner. This work demonstrates a significant forward step towards potential adhesives devoted to hybrid electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Xanthene Radicals and Their Heavy Chalcogen Analogues Showing Tunable Doublet Emission from Green to Near&#8208;infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic luminescent radicals, unlike traditional closed&#8208;shell fluorescent emitters, exhibit distinct luminescence mechanisms, offering promising potential for optoelectronic devices. To date, stable luminescent radicals have predominantly been confined to polychlorinated triphenylmethyl radicals, underscoring the need for new platforms to expand their emission spectra. In this study, we report the synthesis of stable 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues (1a&#8208;c and 2a&#8208;c), which exhibited excellent chemical stability and emission ranging from green to near&#8208;infrared (527~714 nm). Notably, the selenium&#8208;substituted radical (1c) demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41% when doped into its precursor solid. Additionally, the introduction of methoxyphenyl groups has largely enhanced the stability of the radical, showcasing an excellent photostability with the longest half&#8208;life of around 1792 h. The high internal quantum efficiency of up to 81% was further validated in organic light&#8208;emitting diode. This study introduces a novel class of stable carbon&#8208;centered radicals with high tunability and functionality for photoelectric applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Single&#8208;Atom Modification of Hybrid Lead Chlorides for Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Effect and Enhanced Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid lead halides show significant potential in photocatalysis due to their excellent photophysical properties, but the atomically precise modification of their organic component to achieve synergistic interactions with the lead halide units remains a great challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have employed the crystal engineering strategy to construct a class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;substituted hybrid lead halides with electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) effect. The lead halide frameworks consist of 1D linear [PbCl]+ chains as inorganic building units and benzoxadiazole/benzothiadiazole/ benzoselenadiazole&#8208;funtionalized dicarboxylates as linkers. The covalent bonding between the organic ligands with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and the electron&#8208;rich lead halide units not only facilitate the charge separation, but also enhance structural robustness that is critical for photocatalysis. The D&#8208;A structured lead halides serve as highly efficient heterogeneous photooxidation catalysts, including aerobic oxidation of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds, oxidative coupling of primary amines, oxidation of phenylboronic acids and selective oxidation of sulfides that are demonstrated in 30 examples. Importantly, these photooxidation reactions are able to be driven by natural sunlight and ambient air to afford quantitative yields. Moreover, our lead halide photocatalysts are successful to fix into a photocatalytic flow system, which enables the flow&#8208;type synthesis of high value&#8208;added photooxidation products on a gram scale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Understanding the role of adsorbed intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on the structure of electrical double layer (EDL) is essential for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we prepared a series of unconventional face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) phase Ru&#8208;based catalysts (i.e. fcc&#8208;Ru, fcc&#8208;RuCr, and fcc&#8208;RuCrW) by rational tuning the binding energetics of hydroxyl intermediate to engineer the electrochemical interface and boost the performance of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The introduction of oxyphilic metals Cr and W can regulate the orbital occupation of Ru, promote the adsorption of hydroxyl species, resulting in an anomalous behavior that HOR performance under alkaline media exceeds acidic media. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel that the modulated adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface are responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and dynamic evolution of free water molecules from nearest to the electrode surface to above the gap region in the EDL, thereby leading to significantly increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network. Our work reveals a new understanding of the surface intermediates in controlling the dynamic process of interfacial water and hydrogen bonding network in HOR electrocatalysis, and will guide rational design of advanced electrocatalysts through electrochemical interfacial engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Asymmetrical Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co Sites Enable Efficient Chloride&#8208;mediated Ethylene Electrooxidation in Neutral Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) via electrocatalysis is practically attractive because of its sustainability and mild reaction conditions. However, the chlorine oxidation reaction (COR), which is essential for the above process, is commonly catalyzed by dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) with high contents of precious Ru and/or Ir. The development of highly efficient COR electrocatalysts composed of nonprecious metals or decreased amounts of precious metals is highly desirable. Herein, we report a modified Co3O4 with a single&#8208;atom Ir substitution (Ir1/Co3O4) as a highly efficient COR electrocatalyst for chloride&#8208;mediated EOR to ECH in neutral seawater. Ir1/Co3O4 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 94.8% for ECH generation and remarkable stability. Combining experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique atomically asymmetrical Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Co configuration with a strong electron coupling effect in Ir1/Co3O4 can accelerate electron transfer to increase the reaction kinetics and maintain the structural stability of Co3O4 during COR. Moreover, a coupling reaction system integrating the anodic chloride&#8208;mediated and cathodic H2O2&#8208;mediated EOR show a total FE of ~170% for paired electrosynthesis of ECH and ethylene glycol (EG) using ethylene as the raw material. The technoeconomic analysis highlights the promising application prospects of this system.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Strained, Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Porphyrin Cyclophanes: Template&#8208;free Synthesis and Global Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based nanohoops, nanorings, and cages with fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures are highly sought after, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report the template&#8208;free synthesis of a highly strained, bithiophene&#8208;bridged porphyrin cyclophane (1) from a porphyrin quinone via a stereoselective nucleophilic addition followed by intermolecular Yamamoto coupling strategy. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and its dication 12+ reveal significantly distorted cyclophane&#8208;like geometries, with calculated strain energies of 51.2 and 80.7 kcal/mol, respectively. While the neutral compound 1 exhibits localized aromaticity, the dication 12+ is globally aromatic, with the porphyrin unit displaying weak antiaromaticity. Additionally, the dication 12+ undergoes nucleophilic addition with chloride, relieving strain. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for highly strained, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with intriguing electronic properties and chemical reactivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic organic electrochemistry is recognized as one of the most sustainable forms of redox chemistry that can enable a wide variety of useful transformations. In this study, readily prepared pyrolytic carbon electrodes are explored in several powerful rAP transformations as well as C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon provides an alternative to classic amorphous carbon&#8208;based materials that are either expensive or ill&#8208;suited to large&#8208;scale flow reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility off the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable C&#8211;N Bond Formation through Radical&#8208;Mediated Chemistry in Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross&#8208;coupling reactions without the use of external light source, heat, precious metal complex, or trapping agents. A plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion platform is utilized for introduction of hydrazine reagent that undergoes homolytic cleavage forming radical intermediate species. The non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge that causes the cleavage originates from a chemically etched silica capillary. The coupling of the radical intermediates gives various products. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry. The platform is applied herein with a variety of hydrazine substrates, enabling i) self&#8208;coupling to form secondary amines with identical N&#8208;substitutions, ii) cross&#8208;coupling to afford secondary amine with different N&#8208;substituents, iii) cross&#8208;coupling followed by in&#8208;situ dehydrogenation to give the corresponding aryl&#8208;aldimines with two unique N&#8208;substitutions, and iv) cascade heterocyclic carbazole derivatives formation. These unique reactions were made possible in the charged microdroplet environment through our ability to program conditions such as reagent concentration (i.e., flowrate), microdroplet reactivity (i.e., presence or absence of plasma), and reaction timescale (i.e., operational mode source). The selected program is implemented in a co&#8208;axial spray format.</dc:description>
