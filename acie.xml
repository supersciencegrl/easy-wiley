         <title>Preparation of Patterned and Multilayer Thin Films for Organic Electronics via Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant SI&#8208;PET&#8208;RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is used to create the multilayer architectures of 3rd&#8208; and 4th&#8208;generation OLEDs using photoinduced electron transfer reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization. Direct photomasking and digital projection lithography allow for complex patterning at low cost.







Abstract
An oxygen&#8208;tolerant approach is described for preparing surface&#8208;tethered polymer films of organic semiconductors directly from electrode substrates using polymer brush photolithography. A photoinduced electron transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) approach was used to prepare multiblock polymer architectures with the structures of multi&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including electron&#8208;transport, emissive, and hole&#8208;transport layers. The preparation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and thermally assisted fluorescence (TAF) trilayer OLED architectures are described. By using direct photomasking as well as a digital micromirror device, we also show that the surface&#8208;initiated (SI)&#8208;PET&#8208;RAFT approach allows for enhanced control over layer thickness, and spatial resolution in polymer brush patterning at low cost.

         <title>Continuous Flow Z&#8208;Stereoselective Olefin Metathesis: Development and Applications in the Synthesis of Pheromones and Macrocyclic Odorant Molecules**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow Z&#8208;stereoselective olefin metathesis was described with a set of Z&#8208;stereoselective Ru&#8208;catalysts. Good productivity and excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) were obtained in the formation of various internal olefins including highly desirable pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules. A telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors was also reported.







Abstract
The first continuous flow Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis process is reported. Key to realizing this process was the adequate choice of stereoselective catalysts combined with the design of an appropriate continuous reactor setup. The designed continuous process permits various self&#8208;, cross&#8208; and macro&#8208;ring&#8208;closing&#8208;metathesis reactions, delivering products in high selectivity and short residence times. This technique is exemplified by direct application to the preparation of a range of pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules and culminates in a telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/ Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors.

         <title>Hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3]: Optimizing the Optical Anisotropy with Heteroanionic Units for Deep Ultraviolet Birefringent Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sodium hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a new deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], are optimally aligned to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with O&#8722;H bonds, which makes Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] have a large birefringence and band gap.







Abstract
Maximizing the optical anisotropy in birefringent materials has emerged as an efficient route for modulating the polarization&#8208;dependent light propagation. Currently, the generation of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) polarized light below 200&#8197;nm is essential but challenging due to the interdisciplinary significance and insufficiency of high&#8208;performing birefringent crystals. Herein, by introducing multiple heteroanionic units, the first sodium difluorodihydroxytriborate&#8208;boric acid Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a novel deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], optimally align to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with hydrogens, which results in an extremely large birefringence and band gap. The well&#8208;ordered OH/F anions in [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3] were identified and confirmed by various approaches, and also the origin of large birefringence was theoretically discussed. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing hydrogen involved heteroanionic units to design crystals with large birefringence, and also expand the alternative system of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals with new hydroxyfluorooxoborates.

         <title>Plasma Tuning Local Environment of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasma (N2, O2, H2, Ar) regulated h&#8208;BN with distinct local environment were obtained and employed for ODH of propane: N2 treated BN containing more three&#8208;boron center nitrogen&#8208;defects exhibited remarkable propane conversion of 26.0&#8201;% with olefin selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% at 520&#8201;&#176;C. O2 treated BN showed deactivation due to the sintering effect of &#8220;BOx&#8221;. N&#8208;H and B&#8208;H generated during H2 treatment, may be unable to facilitate the reaction activity.







Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides. However, high crystallinity of commercial h&#8208;BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency. Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h&#8208;BN. N2&#8208;treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0&#8201;% propane conversion with 89.4&#8201;% selectivity toward olefins at 520&#8201;&#176;C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that &#8220;three&#8208;boron center&#8221; N&#8208;defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. While the sintering effect of the &#8220;BOx&#8221; species in O2&#8208;treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4&#8201;% conversion at 520&#8201;&#176;C).

3D single&#8208;particle&#8208;tracking microscopy combined with a lock&#8208;in filtering algorithm for the quantitative observation of individual protein&#8211;nanoparticle (NP) interactions without surface immobilization is presented. This highly sensitive method, which can be applied in various protein&#8211;NP systems, gives insight into in&#8197;situ protein corona on a per&#8208;particle basis and provides the possibility to study transient protein&#8211;NP interactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when exposed to biological fluids, forming a dynamic protein corona that affects their fate in biological environments. A comprehensive understanding of the protein corona is lacking due to the inability of current techniques to precisely measure the full corona in&#8197;situ at the single&#8208;particle level. Herein, we introduce a 3D real&#8208;time single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy to &#8220;lock&#8208;on&#8221; to single freely diffusing polystyrene NPs and probe their individual protein coronas, primarily using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model system. The fluorescence signals and diffusive motions of the tracked NPs enable quantification of the &#8220;hard corona&#8221; using mean&#8208;squared displacement analysis. Critically, this method's particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle nature enabled a lock&#8208;in&#8208;type frequency filtering approach to extract the full protein corona, despite the typically confounding effect of high background signal from unbound proteins. From these results, the dynamic in&#8197;situ full protein corona is observed to contain twice the number of proteins compared to the ex&#8197;situ&#8208;measured &#8220;hard&#8221; protein corona.

         <title>Beyond Takai's Olefination Reagent: Persistent Dehalogenation Emerges in a Chromium(III)&#8208;&#956;3&#8208;Methylidyne Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methylidyne complex [CrIII3Cl3(&#956;&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] displays the ultimate product of the CrCl2/CHI3 redox reaction, significantly affecting carbonylic group transformation; the trimetallic compound also exhibits unusual magnetic behavior and provides ready access to half&#8208;sandwich clusters.







Abstract
Reaction of CHI3 with six equivalents of CrCl2 in THF at low temperatures affords [Cr3Cl3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] as the first isolable high&#8208;yield CrIII &#956;3&#8208;methylidyne complex. Substitution of the terminal chlorido ligands via salt metathesis with alkali&#8208;metal cyclopentadienides generates isostructural half&#8208;sandwich chromium(III)&#8208;&#956;3&#8208;methylidynes [CpR3Cr3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)] (CpR=C5H5, C5Me5, C5H4SiMe3). Side and decomposition products of the Cl/CpR exchange reactions were identified and structurally characterized for [Cr4(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)4(&#956;2&#8208;I)2(&#956;4&#8208;O)(thf)4] and [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4SiMe3)CrCl(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)2Li(thf)2]. The Cl/CpR exchange drastically changed the ambient&#8208;temperature effective magnetic moment &#956;eff from 9.30/9.11&#8197;&#956;B (solution/solid) to 3.63/4.32&#8197;&#956;B (CpR=C5Me5). Reactions of [Cr3Cl3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] with aldehydes and ketones produce intricate mixtures of species through oxy/methylidyne exchange, which were partially identified as radical recombination products through GC/MS analysis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Few&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell MFI Zeolite Synthesized using a Simple Di&#8208;quaternary Ammonium Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium cation was used as structure&#8208;directing agent to prepare few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell (ca. 10&#8197;nm) MFI type zeolite catalysts and adsorbents with a wide range of composition (pure silica, aluminosilicate and stannosilicate). The SDA design was selected based on simple heuristic arguments regarding contributions of its structural elements to early crystal growth characteristics of MFI.







Abstract
Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines butyl ammonium, in place of the one commonly used for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m. Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of TMSB molecules are found to effectively optimize SEI via EDL structure regulation. It is their preferable adsorption on the Li&#8208;metal surface and their attraction to PF6&#8722; ions result in a high&#8208;local ion concentration in the EDL region, thus forming an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and demonstrating superior performance.







Abstract
Despite high specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94&#8201;%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5&#8197;Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 90.90&#8201;% capacity retention over 50 cycles.

         <title>Enantioselective Addition of Pyrazoles to Dienes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective addition of pyrazoles to 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported. Secondary and tertiary allylic pyrazoles can be generated with excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first enantioselective addition of pyrazoles to 1,3&#8208;dienes. Secondary and tertiary allylic pyrazoles can be generated with excellent regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies support a pathway distinct from previous hydroaminations: a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT). This hydroamination tolerates a range of functional groups and advances the field of diene hydrofunctionalization.

         <title>Skeletal Editing&#8212;Nitrogen Deletion of Secondary Amines by Anomeric Amide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for structural modification by skeletal editing of secondary amines employs N&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkoxyamide as a reagent. Single&#8208;atom N&#8208;deletion is a novel approach for constructing C&#8722;C bonds under N2 extrusion and uses widely available secondary amines in late&#8208;stage skeletal modification enabling ring contraction and structure optimization of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage modification is highly desirable for the diversification and modification of biologically active compounds. Peripheral editing (e.g., C&#8722;H activation) has been the predominant methodology, whereas skeletal editing is in its infancy. The single&#8208;atom N&#8208;deletion using anomeric amide reagents constitutes a powerful tool to modify the underlying molecular skeletons of secondary amines. N&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkoxyamide is easily prepared on a large scale and promotes C&#8722;C bond formation in good yields under the extrusion of N2 for a variety of (cyclic) aliphatic amines. The exploitation of widely available amines allows the use of existing amine synthesis protocols to translate into the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds, enabling ring contraction and the potential for structure optimization of biologically active compounds.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li Metal Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the limitation inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attentions have focused on the potential successor of Li&#8208;ion batteries such as Lithium Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and Lithium oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic Lithium as anode is essential. Nevertheless, the growth of Li dendrites accompanied with severe safety hazards hinder the practical application of Li metal anode. Another obstacle that hinders the practical application of Li metal anode is the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles, which causes inevitable active Li loss. Hence, a large amount of inventory metallic Li is needed to prolong the cycle life of Li metal batteries. However, largely excessive Li in the anode is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li metal batteries. For Li metal batteries under practical conditions, low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) accompanied with high&#8208;voltage cathode is perquisite. In this reviews, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolyte for practical Li metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolyte for practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic FePt@PtBi Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. One effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Here, we demonstrate a general surface&#8208;engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating chemically ordered intermetallic phases with alloy&#160;PtBi shells. FePt@PtBi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles&#160;showed the best ORR performance with a mass activity of 0.96 A mg  Pt  &#8211;1  and a specific activity of 2.06 mA cm  &#8211;2  , respectively 7 times and 11 times those of the corresponding values for benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows much better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than conventional Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The observed comprehensive enhancement in ORR performance of FePt@PtBi can be attributed to the increased compressive strain of the Pt surface due to in&#8208;plane shearing resulting from the presence of the large Bi atoms in the surface&#8208;structured PtBi overlayers, as well as charge displacement via Pt&#8722;Bi bonding which mitigates crossover issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Co Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we reported a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance shows better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015 e s  &#8211;1  site  &#8211;1  ). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Direct Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8210;H Acylation and Arylation in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp  3  )&#8210;C(sp  2  ) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8208;48 hours to only 5&#8208;15 minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.</dc:description>

Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12-48 hours to only 5-15 minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Enantiopure Pyrrolidines by C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8211;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8211;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) from a&#160;  N  &#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free&#160;  NH&#8208;  derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Here, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovers the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral distorted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes bearing a nonagon&#8208;embedded carbohelicene.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 4.2 &#215; 10&#8211;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&lt; 80 nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo&#8208;EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N&#8208;terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 at concentrations as low as 10  6  copies/mL. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing ammonia quantification minefield in photo/electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis&#8212;a low&#8208;carbon and sustainable process has developed fast over the past decade while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH  3  brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH  3  synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. By regulating the parameters of detection methods, the experimental detection limitation can be expanded from 0.2 ppm to 0.1 ppm, even lower. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ion Binding Mediates the Reversible Interconversion of Cis and Trans Peroxido Dicopper Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium&#8208;ion binding mediates the reversible interconversion of the prototypical trans&#8208;peroxido Cu2O2 core (TP) to the rare and biologically relevant cis&#8208;peroxido Cu2O2 core (CP). This provides new opportunities to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O2 activation in biomimetic systems.







Abstract
Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu2O2) featured in type III copper proteins (hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O2 transport and substrate oxidation in many organisms. &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis peroxido dicopper cores (CP) have been proposed as key structures in the early stages of O2 binding in these proteins; their reversible isomerization to other Cu2O2 cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic CP cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of CP Cu2O2 species remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report the reversible interconversion of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans peroxido (TP) and CP dicopper cores. CaII mediates this process by reversible binding at the Cu2O2 core, highlighting the unique capability for metal&#8208;ion binding events to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O2 activation in biomimetic systems.

         <title>Supramolecular Bioimaging through Signal Amplification by Combining Indicator Displacement Assay with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel supramolecular strategy for fluorescence imaging via incorporation of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into indicator displacement assay.







Abstract
Fluorescent chemosensors are powerful imaging tools in the fields of life sciences and engineering. Based on the principle of supramolecular chemistry, indicator displacement assay (IDA) provides an alternative approach for constructing and optimizing chemosensors, which has the advantages of simplicity, tunability, and modularity. However, the application of IDA in bioimaging continues to face a series of challenges, including interfering signals, background noise, and inconsistent spatial location. Accordingly, we herein report a supramolecular bioimaging strategy of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;assisted IDA by employing macrocyclic amphiphiles as the operating platform. By merging FRET with IDA, the limitations of IDA in bioimaging were addressed. As a proof of concept, the study achieved mitochondria&#8208;targeted imaging of adenosine triphosphate in live cells with signal amplification. This study opens a non&#8208;covalent avenue for bioimaging with advancements in tunability, generality, and simplicity, apart from the covalent approach.

         <title>&#8220;Repaired and Activated&#8221; DNAzyme Enables the Monitoring of DNA Alkylation Repair in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report &#8220;repaired and activated&#8221; DNAzymes (RADzymes) as a simple and versatile platform for the measurement of multiple DNA alkylation repair in living cells. The catalytic activity of RADzymes was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair, thus providing a useful strategy for the study of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.







Abstract
Direct measurement of DNA repair is critical for the annotation of their clinical relevance and the discovery of drugs for cancer therapy. Here we reported a &#8220;repaired and activated&#8221; DNAzyme (RADzyme) by incorporating a single methyl lesion (O6MeG, 3MeC, or 1MeA) at designated positions through systematic screening. We found that the catalytic activity of the RADzyme was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair. Benefit from these findings, a fluorogenic RADzyme sensor was developed for the monitoring of MGMT&#8208;mediated repair of O6MeG lesion. Importantly, the sensor allowed the evaluation of MGMT repair activity in different cells and under drugs treatment. Furthermore, another RADzyme sensor was engineered for the monitoring of ALKBH2&#8208;mediated repair of 3MeC lesion. This strategy provides a simple and versatile tool for the study of the basic biology of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure CO electroreduction at silver produces ethanol and propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing CO  2  to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO  2  , copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products &#8211; making the CO  2  electrochemistry of silver very similar to copper at sufficiently high coverage.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide&#8208;Modifying Radical SAM Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report biochemical study of a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP). This rSAM enzyme exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity, which produces cyclophane in vivo but formylglycine and aminomalonate (Ama) in vitro. Unlike most enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis, this enzyme does not require leader peptide for activity.







Abstract
Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three&#8208;residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3&#8208;CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatic study revealed that 3&#8208;CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence. Our work discloses the first ribosomal path towards Ama formation, providing a possible hint for the rich occurrence of Ama in Nature.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Synthetic Growth Factor Surrogates with Fine&#8208;Tuned Agonism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists that elicit a desired signal activity is reported. Synthetic growth factor surrogates showing fine&#8208;tuned agonism were developed by exploiting the programmability of DNA aptamer. These DNA&#8208;based agonists can be used to regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting moderate receptor signaling.







Abstract
Designing synthetic surrogates of functional proteins is an important, albeit challenging, task in the field of chemistry. A strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists for growth factor or cytokine receptors that elicit a desired signal activity has been in high demand, as such ligands hold great promise as safer and more effective therapeutics. In the present study, we used a DNA aptamer as a building block and described the strategy&#8208;guided design of a synthetic receptor agonist with fine&#8208;tuned agonism. The developed synthetic partial agonist can regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting fine&#8208;tuned receptor signaling.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich High&#8208;Entropy Oxide Nanosheets for Efficient 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) nanosheets with high surface area are synthesized through a plasma strategy under low&#8208;temperature. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the HEOs nanosheets with superior electrocatalytic activity for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 nanosheets deliver improved activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method.

&lt;p&gt;Defect-rich high-entropy oxides (HEOs) nanosheets with high surface area are synthesized through a plasma strategy under low-temperature. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the HEOs nanosheets with superior electrocatalytic activity for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential. However, the conventional high-temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron-scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here we report a low-temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect-rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets deliver improved activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high-temperature method. Our method opens new opportunities for synthesizing nanostructured HEOs with great potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid Luminescent Enhancement Triggered by One&#8208;shot Needlestick&#8208;stimulus Using a Liquescent Gold(I) Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescence from a bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt of gold(I) complex with an N&#8208;heterocycliccarbene&#8208;based ligand increased rapidly upon application of a needlestick&#8208;stimulus. Upon stimulation under UV&#8208;light irradiation, the weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state rapidly transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds.







Abstract
Luminescence from a gold(I) complex with an N&#8208;heterocycliccarbene&#8208;based ligand, 1+&#8901;NTf2&#8722;, increased rapidly upon the application of one&#8208;shot needlestick&#8208;stimulus. The weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid&#8208;state of 1+&#8901;NTf2&#8722; was prepared by cooling its melted liquid to 90&#8201;&#176;C. Upon applying a weak pinpoint stimulus with a needle, this weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds. The emission after applying the stimulus could be visualized upon UV excitation even under ambient room light. This sequential phase transition from a stable solid to a liquid and then to a metastable solid could occur repeatedly without any measurable degradation of the complex. Various shapes could be prepared by casting the liquid&#8208;state complex into molds of different designs. This rapid response is thought to be triggered by the flexible intermolecular interactions in the kinetically generated aggregates formed upon cooling the liquid state, and by the strong Au&#8211;Au interactions in the thermodynamically stable crystals after applying the needlestick&#8208;stimulus.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Cesium Manganese Bromides Nanocrystals with Color&#8208;Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides nanocrystals, which achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity.







Abstract
For display applications, it is highly desirable to obtain tunable red/green/blue emission. However, lead&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) generally exhibit broadband emission with poor color purity. Herein, we developed a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides NCs and we can achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity in these NCs. Such phase transition can be triggered by isopropanol: from one dimensional (1D) CsMnBr3 NCs (red&#8208;color emission) to zero dimensional (0D) Cs3MnBr5 NCs (green&#8208;color emission). Furthermore, in a humid environment both 1D CsMnBr3 NCs and 0D Cs3MnBr5 NCs can be transformed into 0D Cs2MnBr4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O NCs (blue&#8208;color emission). Cs2MnBr4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O NCs could inversely transform into the mixture of CsMnBr3 and Cs3MnBr5 phase during the thermal annealing dehydration step. Our work highlights the tunable optical properties in single component NCs via phase engineering and provides a new avenue for future endeavors in light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Indolizy Carbene Ligand. Evaluation of Electronic Properties and Applications in Asymmetric Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuI complexes coordinated to the Indolizy ligand, a new carbene ligand that results from the gold&#8208;promoted cyclization of a pyridyl&#8208;allene were investigated. The electronic properties of the Indolizy ligand were analysed. The introduction of a stereogenic center in &#945;&#8208;position to the carbene center coupled to the introduction of a pending phosphine oxide group affords highly efficient and enantioselective AuI catalysts.







Abstract
We report herein a new family of carbene ligands based on an indolizine&#8208;ylidene (Indolizy) moiety. The corresponding gold(I) complexes are easily obtained from the gold(I)&#8208;promoted cyclization of allenylpyridine precursors. Evaluation of the electronic properties by experimental methods and also by DFT calculations confirms strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands. Cationization of the gold(I) complexes generates catalytic species that trigger diverse reactions of (poly)unsaturated precursors. When armed with a methylene phosphine oxide moiety on the stereogenic center adjacent to the nitrogen atom, the corresponding bifunctional carbene ligands give rise to highly enantioselective heterocyclizations. DFT calculations brought some rationalization and highlighted the critical roles played by the phosphine oxide group and the tosylate anion in the asymmetric cyclization of &#947;&#8208;allenols.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Conjugated Polymers under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
From fibers to flakes&#8212;Modifying the morphology of supramolecular organization through vibrational strong coupling.







Abstract
Strong coupling plays a significant role in influencing chemical reactions and tuning material properties by modifying the energy landscapes of the systems. Here we study the effect of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on supramolecular organization. For this purpose, a rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymer known to form gels was strongly coupled together with its solvent in a microfluidic IR Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity. Absorption and fluorescence studies indicate a large modification of the self&#8208;assembly under such cooperative VSC. Electron microscopy confirms that in this case, the supramolecular morphology is totally different from that observed in the absence of strong coupling. In addition, the self&#8208;assembly kinetics are altered and depend on the solvent vibration under VSC. The results are compared to kinetic isotope effects on the self&#8208;assembly to help clarify the role of different parameters under strong coupling. These findings indicate that VSC is a valuable new tool for controlling supramolecular assemblies with broad implications for the molecular and material sciences.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Phosphite&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenation of &#945;&#8208;Diketones Enables Wolff Rearrangement and Staudinger Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>

Photocatalytic C=O bond activation is enabled by exploring the unprecedented photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes formed from &#945;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, which provides a novel diazo&#8208;free access to the Wolff rearrangement. The strategy was successfully applied to the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and valuable &#946;&#8208;lactams.







Abstract
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic activation of C=O bonds by exploiting the photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes, readily accessible from &#945;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, is reported. This mild and environmentally friendly strategy provides an unprecedented and efficient access to the Wolff rearrangement reaction which traditionally entails &#945;&#8208;diazoketones as precursors. The resulting ketenes could be precisely trapped by alcohols/thiols to give &#945;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and by imines to afford the valuable &#946;&#8208;lactams in up to 99&#8201;% yields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioenriched spiro&#8208;oxiranes bearing three contiguous stereocenters were synthesized using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization sequence. Starting from a linear substrate, the cascade enabled the formation of a spirocyclic framework in a single step. sp  2  &#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles were found to be competent initiators for this cascade, giving arylated or alkynylated products, respectively. Derivatization studies demonstrated the synthetic versatility of both the epoxide and the alkyne moieties of the products. DFT calculations were used to reconcile spectroscopic discrepancies observed between the solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Glycine from Oxalic acid and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In manufacturing C&#8208;N bond&#8208;containing compounds, it is important challenge to alternate the conventional methodologies that utilize reactive substrates, toxic reagents and organic solvents. In this study, we developed an electrochemical method to synthesize a C&#8208;N bond&#8208;containing molecule avoiding the use of cyanides and amines by harnessing nitrate (NO  3  &#8208;  ) as a nitrogen source in an aqueous electrolyte. In addition, we utilized oxalic acid as a carbon source which can be obtained from electrochemical conversion of CO  2  , so that our approach can provide a route for the utilization of anthropogenic CO  2  and nitrate wastes which cause serious environmental problems including global warming and eutrophication. Interestingly, the coreduction of oxalic acid and nitrate generated reactive intermediates, which led to C&#8208;N bond formation followed by further reduction to an amino acid, namely, glycine. By carefully controlling this multireduction process with a fabricated Cu&#8208;Hg electrode, we demonstrated the efficient production of glycine with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of up to 43.1% at &#8208;1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density = ~90 mA cm  &#8208;2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis by Br&#248;nsted Acid/Carbodicarbene Mimicking Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Like Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present of co&#8208;modulator alcohol, the putative strong &#963; donor, CDC is reshaped into frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;like reactivity. The unique synergistic FLP behavior of CDC; unachievable by its counterpart NHCs, show to have beneficial and complementary effects on isocyanate cyclotrimerization, LA polymerization, MMA polymerization and dehydrosilylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Carbodicarbene (CDC), unique carbenic entities bearing two lone pairs of electrons are well&#8208;known for their strong Lewis basicity. We demonstrate herein, upon introducing a weak Br&#248;nsted acid benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as a co&#8208;modulator, CDC is remolded into a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;like reactivity. DFT calculation and experimental evidence show BnOH loosely interacting with the binding pocket of CDC via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Four distinct reactions in nature were deployed to demonstrate the viability of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as synergistic FLP/Modulator (CDC/BnOH), demonstrating enhanced catalytic reactivity in cyclotrimerization of isocyanate, polymerization process for L&#8208;lactide (LA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and dehydrosilylation of alcohols. Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity. This finding also provides a new spin in diversifying FLP reactivity with co&#8208;modulator or co&#8208;catalyst.

Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity. This finding also provides a new spin in diversifying FLP reactivity with co-modulator or co-catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Chemistry and Microstructure Perspective on Ion&#8208;Conducting Membranes for Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The membrane in redox flow batteries (RFBs) plays a critical role in their practical application. Promising RFB membranes require the deliberate design of their materials chemistry and microstructure. This Review highlights the design rationales of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level with in&#8208;depth discussion of the structure&#8211;property relationships, and subsequently discusses future prospect in the field.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are among the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability, and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion&#8208;conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly. Specific systems must meet additional requirements, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this Review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with an emphasis on new chemistry, novel microstructures, and innovative fabrication strategies. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.

         <title>Enabling Cysteine&#8208;Free Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with a Ligation Auxiliary Capable of Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MPyE group is the first sulfur based auxiliary enabling peptide ligation at proline and &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids. The pyridine nitrogen probably acts as a base that catalyzes the S&#8594;N acyl transfer during native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a MnII complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.

         <title>Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Ligands Enable Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Protoboration and Protosilylation of Terminal Alkynes: A Versatile Portal to Functionalized Alkenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper catalysts bearing cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands exhibit remarkably high Markovikov selectivity in the protoboration and &#8208;silylation of terminal alkynes. This work demonstrates the ability of this strongly &#963;&#8208;donating family of ligands to perturb regioselectivity in the addition of copper&#8722;boryl species to C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
Regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes represents a straightforward route to access alkenyl boronate and silane building blocks. In previously reported catalytic systems, high selectivity is achieved with a limited scope of substrates and/or reagents, with general solutions lacking. Herein, we describe a selective copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes that is facilitated by strongly donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands. Using this method, both alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted alkynes are coupled with a variety of boryl and silyl reagents with high &#945;&#8208;selectivity. The reaction is scalable, and the products are versatile intermediates that can participate in various downstream transformations. Preliminary mechanistic experiments shed light on the role of CAAC ligands in this process.

         <title>Molecular Brush Surfactants: Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of cooperative assembly between hydrophilic molecular brushes and hydrophobic oligomeric ligands, the molecular brush surfactant (MBS) is formed. With MBSs at the oil&#8211;water interface, stable emulsions can be easily prepared in a one&#8208;step process. When jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in highly nonequilibrium shapes, e.g., liquid letters.







Abstract
Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time&#8208;consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water&#8208;soluble molecular brushes and oil&#8208;soluble oligomeric ligands, the in situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all&#8208;liquid biomimetic system.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with free COOH groups and suitable pore confinement demonstrates excellent performance for the important and challenging C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) mixture is desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Realizing efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging owing to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a functionalized HOF (HOF&#8208;16) with free &#8208;COOH sites for the efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. Under ambient conditions, HOF&#8208;16 shows a significant C3H6/C3H8 uptake difference (by 76&#8201;%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8208;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of HOF&#8208;16 was validated by breakthrough experiments. HOF&#8208;16 is stable towards strong acidity and water.

         <title>Mechanically Triggered Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction was developed for the detection and amplification of cell mechanics. It enables the quantification of cellular receptor forces with improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on a microscope and in a more rapid manner with a conventional plate reader.







Abstract
Cells transmit piconewton forces to receptors to mediate processes such as migration and immune recognition. A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano&#8208;HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano&#8208;HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano&#8208;IC50 for aspirin, Y&#8208;27632, and eptifibatide. Given that cell mechanical phenotypes are of clinical importance, mechano&#8208;HCR may offer a convenient route for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Enantiospecific Detection of D&#8208;Amino Acid through Synergistic Upconversion Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoprobe for D&#8208;amino acid enantiospecific detection was proposed based on synergistic upconversion energy transfer, featuring a wide detection range, low detection limit, and in vivo noninvasive detection with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
D&#8208;amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases. However, current DAA detection strategies mainly rely on bulky instrumentation or electrochemical probes, limiting their cellular and animal applications. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;coupled nanoprobe that can detect enantiospecific DAAs through synergistic energy transfer. This nanoprobe offers near&#8208;infrared upconversion capability, a wide dynamic detection range, and a detection limit of 2.2&#8197;&#956;M, providing a versatile platform for in vivo noninvasive detection of DAAs with high enantioselectivity. These results potentially allow real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecular handedness in living animals, as well as developing antipsychotic treatment strategies.

         <title>NIR&#8208;triggered intracellular H+ transients for lamellipodia&#8208;collapsed antimetastasis and enhanced chemodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solid tumours, tumour invasion and metastasis account for 90% of cancer&#8208;related deaths. Cell migration is steered by the lamellipodia formed at the leading edge. These lamellipodia can drive the cell body forward via its mechanical deformation regulated by cofilin. Inhibiting cofilin activity can cause significant defects in directional lamellipodia formation and the locomotory capacity of cell invasion, thus contributing to antimetastatic treatment. Here, a near infrared light (NIR)&#8208;controlled nanoscale proton supplier was designed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with a core coated in MIL&#8208;88B for interior photoacids loading; this photoacids loading can boost H+  transients in cells, which converts the cofilin to an inactive form. Strikingly, inactive cofilin loses the ability to mediate lamellipodia deformation for cell migration. Additionally, the iron, which serves as a catalytic active centre in MIL&#8208;88B, initiates an enhanced Fenton reaction due to the increased H+  in the tumour, ultimately achieving intensive chemodynamic therapy (CDT). This work provides new insight into H+  transients in cells, which not only regulates cofilin protonation for antimetastatic treatment but also improves chemodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>MnO2 Electrocatalysts Coordinating Alcohol Oxidation for Ultra&#8208;durable Hydrogen and Chemical Productions in Acidic Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic hydrogen production under acidic conditions is of great importance for industrialization in comparison to that in alkaline media, which, unfortunately, still remains great challenges due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant, cost&#8208;effective and highly active anodic electrocatalysts that can be used durably under strongly acidic conditions. Here we report an unexpected finding that manganese oxide, a kind of common non&#8208;noble catalysts easily soluble in acidic solutions, can be applied as a highly efficient and extremely durable anodic electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from an acidic aqueous solution of alcohols. Particularly in a glycerol solution, a potential of as low as 1.36 V (vs. RHE) is needed at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , which is 270 mV lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to oxidize glycerol into value&#8208;added chemicals such as formic acid, without oxygen production. To our surprise, the manganese oxide exhibits extremely high stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen production in coupling with glycerol oxidation for longer than 865 hours compared to shorter than 10 h for OER. Moreover, the effect of the addition of glycerol on the electrochemical durability has been probed via  in situ  Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. This work opens an unprecedented window that acidity&#8208;unstable metal oxide electrocatalysts can be used robustly in acidic media under the presence of certain substances for electrochemical purposes, such as hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;mediator&#8208;effector cascade systems for amplified protein kinase activity imaging and phosphorylation&#8208;induced drug release in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases constitute a rich pool of biomarkers and therapeutic targets of tremendous diseases including cancer. However, sensing kinase activity  in vivo  while implementing treatments according to kinase hyperactivation remains challenging. Herein, we present a nano&#8208;mediator&#8208;effector cascade system that can  in situ  magnify the subtle events of kinase&#8208;catalyzed phosphorylation  via  DNA amplification machinery to achieve kinase activity imaging and kinase&#8208;responsive drug release  in vivo  . In this cascade, the phosphorylation&#8208;mediated disassembly of DNA/peptide complex on the nanomediators initiated the detachment of fluorescent hairpin DNAs from the nanoeffectors  via  hybridization chain reaction (HCR), leading to fluorescence recovery and therapeutic cargo release. We demonstrated that this nanosystem simultaneously enabled trace protein kinase A (PKA) activity imaging and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for inhibition of tumor cell growth both  in vitro  and  in vivo  , affording a kinase&#8208;specific sense&#8208;and&#8208;treat paradigm for cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Multidimensional Photocatalysts for Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  In this work, ultrathin porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks MOFs (2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets, TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate photoinduced electron/energy transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were successfully achieved using ZnTCPP nanosheets as a photocatalyst. The synthesized polymers exhibited narrow molecular weight distributions (MWDs) and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, the 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were successfully applied as photocatalysts for implementation in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects. In addition to providing an efficient catalytic system, ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials. Finally, the presence of ZnTCPP embedded in the materials conferred effective antimicrobial activity under visible light via the production of singlet oxygen, affording 98.05 &#177; 1.08% and 93.80 &#177; 1.98% anti&#8208;bacterial efficiency against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds via Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Escape from flatland: Increased saturation (fraction of sp3) is more likely to be successful when moving compounds through the drug development pipeline. Bridged nitrogen heterocycles have a huge potential in drug discovery, although long synthetic sequences are typically required. New step&#8208;economic and selective organic synthesis is therefore highly sought after. Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106716) the synthesis of the normorphan skeleton through challenging tandem catalysis. Cover design by Joris Snaet.

         <title>Nanoscale Advancement Continues&#8212;From Catalysts and Reagents to Restructuring of Reaction Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the highlighted article, the effect of alkane and water additives on the structure of several ionic liquids was used to increase the acidity of liquid reaction media and to accelerate the acid&#8208;catalyzed transformations. A possible connection between the appearance of a pronounced microstructure of the obtained systems and their performance in catalytic processes was proposed on the basis of microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.







Abstract
Comprehensive studies dedicated to the search for specific properties of matter at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales have greatly enriched the fields of chemistry and materials science. From the point of view of synthetic chemistry, discoveries in the field of nanoscale catalysis, in which the size effects of active centers are used to accelerate the reactions, are of particular importance. However, another approach for the promotion of chemical transformations based on the micro&#8208; or nanoconfinement of reacting molecules or even on the structuring of the reaction media as a whole is gaining interest as a highly valuable tool. Herein, we highlight the example of an increase in the efficiency of phenol alkylation and tert&#8208;butylation of benzyl alcohol in reaction media based on ionic liquids by the creation of acidic microdomains in the presence of small molecule additives.

         <title>Probing the Paradigm of Promiscuity for N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes and their Protein Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir complexes showed distinctive reactivity to hen egg white lysozyme by forming adducts at different binding sites and/or underwent different ligand exchange reactions. Protein crystallography, mass spectrometry and computational studies demonstrated the role of the metal centers and the protein microenvironment in determining their selectivity for a specific site.







Abstract
Metal complexes can be considered a &#8220;paradigm of promiscuity&#8221; when it comes to their interactions with proteins. They often form adducts with a variety of donor atoms in an unselective manner. We have characterized the adducts formed between a series of isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir centers and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Distinctive behavior for the metal compounds was observed with the more labile Ru and Rh complexes targeting mainly a surface l&#8208;histidine moiety through cleavage of p&#8208;cymene or NHC co&#8208;ligands, respectively. In contrast, the more inert Os and Ir derivatives were detected abundantly in an electronegative binding pocket after undergoing ligand exchange of a chlorido ligand for an amino acid side chain. Computational studies supported the binding profiles and hinted at the role of the protein microenvironment for metal complexes eliciting selectivity for specific binding sites on the protein.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Phosphors: Highly Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution and Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the highest quantum yield ambient solution state (ca. 41.8&#8201;%) and hydrogel (ca. 34&#8201;%) room temperature phosphorescence, by employing an organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy is reported. These soft&#8208;hybrids are further employed as an efficient light&#8208;harvesting scaffold by co&#8208;anchoring acceptor dyes to yield triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer mediated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Solution phase room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic phosphors is seldom realized. Herein we report one of the highest quantum yield solution state RTP (ca. 41.8&#8201;%) in water, from a structurally simple phthalimide phosphor, by employing an organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy. We further use these supramolecular hybrid phosphors as a light&#8208;harvesting scaffold to achieve delayed fluorescence from orthogonally anchored Sulforhodamine acceptor dyes via an efficient triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET), which is rarely achieved in solution. Electrostatic cross&#8208;linking of the inorganic scaffold at higher concentrations further facilitates the formation of self&#8208;standing hydrogels with efficient RTP and energy&#8208;transfer mediated long&#8208;lived fluorescence.

         <title>Chemoresponsive Supramolecular Polypseudorotaxanes with Infinite Switching Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel polypseudorotaxane [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. It depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 upon addition of H and AgSF6, while it reforms with successive addition of G. The transformations between [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n and H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 can be switched for infinite cycles.







Abstract
Chemoresponsive supramolecular systems with infinite switching capability are important for applications in recycled materials and intelligent devices. To attain this objective, here a chemoresponsive polypseudorotaxane is reported on the basis of a bis(p&#8208;phenylene)&#8208;34&#8208;crown&#8208;10 macrocycle (H) and a cyano&#8208;substituted viologen guest (G). H and G form a [2]pseudorotaxane (H&#8835;G) both in solution and in the solid state. Upon addition of AgSF6, a polypseudorotaxane (denoted as [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n) forms as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane (denoted as H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2) upon addition of H and AgSF6, while it reforms with successive addition of G. The transformations between [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n and H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 can be switched for infinite cycles, superior to the conventional chemoresponsive supramolecular polymeric systems with limited switching capability.

         <title>Superatom&#8208;in&#8208;Superatom [RhH@Ag24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom concept was demonstrated for the first time. A rhodium hydride (RhH) superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom [RhH@Ag24(SR)18]2&#8722; nanocluster. The Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 framework by forming the RhH superatom resembling the closed d&#8208;shell Pd atom ([Kr]4d10).







Abstract
Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24 framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24 framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.

         <title>Partial Coordination&#8208;Perturbed Bi&#8208;Copper Sites for Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the process of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, the different synergistic effects (the distance DCu&#8208;Cu and the dihedral angle &#946;Cu&#8208;Cu) between neighboring catalytic copper (bi&#8208;copper) active sites induced by the variations of coordination microenvironment lead to regular FECH4: FEC2H4 changes in crystalline single&#8208;chain models (Cu&#8208;PzH, Cu&#8208;PzCl, Cu&#8208;PzBr, and Cu&#8208;PzI).







Abstract
In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), it is challenging to develop a stable, well&#8208;defined catalyst model system that is able to examine the influence of the synergistic effect between adjacent catalytic active sites on the selective generation of C1 or C2 products. We have designed and synthesized a stable crystalline single&#8208;chain catalyst model system for electrochemical CO2RR, which involves four homomorphic one&#8208;dimensional chain&#8208;like compounds (Cu&#8208;PzH, Cu&#8208;PzCl, Cu&#8208;PzBr, and Cu&#8208;PzI). The main structural difference of these four chains is the substituents of halogen atoms with different electronegativity on the Pz ligands. Consequently, different synergistic effects between bi&#8208;copper centers lead to changes in the faradic efficiency (FE
:FE
). This work provides a simple and stable crystalline single&#8208;chain model system for systematically studying the influence of coordination microenvironment on catalytically active centers in the CO2RR.

         <title>A Unified Catalytic Asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) Annulation Strategy to Access Chiral Spirooxindole&#8208;Fused Oxacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxides, which function as umpoled bielectrophilic synthons, enable the unified catalytic asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) annulation reactions in the presence of a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC). This new strategy provides an unconventional protocol to access the biologically important chiral spirooxindole&#8208;tetrahydrofurans and &#8208;tetrahydropyrans in good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A unified catalytic asymmetric (N+1) (N=4, 5) annulation reaction of oxindoles with bifunctional peroxides has been achieved in the presence of a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC). This general strategy utilizes peroxides as unique bielectrophilic four&#8208; or five&#8208;atom synthons to participate in the C&#8722;C and the subsequent umpolung C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reactions with one&#8208;carbon unit nucleophiles, thus providing a distinct method to access the valuable chiral spirooxindole&#8208;tetrahydrofurans and &#8208;tetrahydropyrans with good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of high enantioselectivity. The gram&#8208;scale syntheses and synthetic utility of the resultant products were also demonstrated.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopic Evidence of Key Intermediate Species and Role of NiFe Dual&#8208;Catalytic Center in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional superstructures consisting of plasmonic Au core and catalytically active Ni3FeOx satellites were used to study the OER process on NiFe&#8208;based catalysts. The in situ spectroscopic results on interfacial reaction intermediates disclose the synergistic mechanism of the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;centered OER catalyst.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted great interests due to the low price and high activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe&#8208;catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label&#8208;free surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni3FeOx nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni3FeOx core&#8208;satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidence of intermediate O&#8208;O&#8722; species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH&#8722; to O&#8208;O&#8722; oxidation. The O&#8208;O&#8722; species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to NiIII and eventually forms O2 product.

         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization reaction of electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes with &#945;&#8208;substituted isocyanoacetate ester through an interrupted Barton&#8211;Zard reaction is reported. A range of optically active pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indole derivatives was obtained in good reactivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with high stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, 97&#8201;% ee) in the presence of 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ag2O and amino&#8208;phosphine L1.







Abstract
Herein we report a catalytic asymmetric dearomatization reaction of electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes with &#945;&#8208;substituted isocyanoacetates through an interrupted Barton&#8211;Zard reaction. A range of optically active pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indole derivatives was obtained in good yields (up to 97&#8201;%) with high stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee), using a catalytic system consisting of a cinchona&#8208;derived amino&#8208;phosphine and silver oxide. This reaction features wide substrate scope and mild conditions, and provides a new strategy for developing asymmetric dearomatization reactions.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Vertex Linkage of (BO4)&#8208;Tetrahedra in a Borosulfate: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One synthesis to control the amount of reacting SO3 and the cation to boron ratio during solvothermal syntheses with oleum is crucial to explore the structural diversity of borosulfates. The novel borosulfate Sr[B3O(SO4)4(HSO4)] was synthesized phase&#8208;pure and the anionic substructure features a triple vertex connection of three (BO4) tetrahedra via one oxygen atom. The motif was unknown for borosulfates so far, but is not uncommon for borates. This outperformance of silicate untypical behavior of a borosulfate was further investigated by means of DFT calculations, as reported by J&#246;rn Bruns et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106337).

         <title>Selective C&#8211;F Bond Allylation of Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By capitalizing on the unique fluorine effects, a mono&#8208;selective C&#8722;F bond allylation of trifluoromethylalkenes, which proceeds through a cascade of nucleophilic SN2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and Cope rearrangement, was achieved under operationally convenient conditions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of CF3 group represents an appealing strategy for the incorporation of pharmaceutically privileged difluoromethylene moiety. Despite the recent significant advancement attained in the functionalization of Ar&#8208;CF3 molecules, prescriptions amenable for alkenyl&#8208;CF3 congeners remain sufficiently inadequate. Herein, we report a strategically novel protocol for the C&#8722;F bond elaboration of trifluoromethylalkene derivatives. By using readily available allyl metallics as nucleophilic coupling partner, the present reaction enables an expedient construction of structurally diversified CF2&#8208;bridged 1,5&#8208;dienes. Furthermore, the exquisite selectivity observed in this transformation is revealed to be based on the underlying mechanism that consists of a cascade of nucleophilic SN2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and electronically promoted Cope rearrangement.

         <title>Alkene Difunctionalization Triggered by a Stabilized Allenyl Radical: Concomitant Installation of Two Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosed herein for the first time is the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds. However, simultaneous installation of two unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds via alkene difunctionalization remains elusive, attributable to the high instability and transient lifetimes of alkenyl and alkynyl radicals. Herein, we report the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes for the first time, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene.

         <title>Tissue Fluid Triggered Enzyme Polymerization for Ultrafast Gelation and Cartilage Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ an artificial enzyme complex to trigger ultrafast hydrogelation by the tandem biocatalytic generation of carbon radicals from tissue glucose, which demonstrates a high cellular biocompatibility and a significant promotion of cartilage regeneration following the in situ injection.







Abstract
The in situ gelation of injectable precursors is desirable in the field of tissue regeneration, especially in the context of irregular defect filling.

&lt;p&gt;We employ an artificial enzyme complex to trigger ultrafast hydrogelation by the tandem biocatalytic generation of carbon radicals from tissue glucose, which demonstrates a high cellular biocompatibility and a significant promotion of cartilage regeneration following the in situ injection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in situ gelation of injectable precursors is desirable in the field of tissue regeneration, especially in the context of irregular defect filling. The current driving forces for fast gelation include the phase-transition of thermally sensitive copolymers, click chemical reactions with tissue components, and metal coordination effect. However, the rapid formation of tough hydrogels remains a challenge. Inspired by aerobic metabolism, we herein propose a tissue-fluid-triggered cascade enzymatic polymerization process catalyzed by glucose oxidase and ferrous glycinate for the ultrafast gelation of acryloylated chondroitin sulfates and acrylamides. The highly efficient production of carbon radicals and macromolecules contribute to rapid polymerization for soft tissue augmentation in bone defects. The copolymer hydrogel demonstrated the regeneration-promoting capacity of cartilage. As the first example of using artificial enzyme complexes for in situ polymerization, this work offers a biomimetic approach to the design of strength-adjustable hydrogels for bio-implanting and bio-printing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Resistance&#8208;Chiral Anisotropy of Chiral Mesostructured Half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films exhibiting the chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity. Below 30&#8197;K, as the half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 is completely spin polarized and the chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films can act as a spin filter, the transport of spins is chirality&#8208;dependent. Thus, the antipodal chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films exhibited asymmetric responses to the spin transport and resulted in different electrical resistance.







Abstract
Half&#8208;metallic materials are theoretically predicted to be metallic and insulating, which have not been confirmed experimentally, and the predictions are still in doubt. We report the resistance&#8208;chiral anisotropy (R&#8208;ChA), i.e., chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity, in chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films (CMFFs) grown on the substrates via a hydrothermal method using amino acids as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. Two levels of chirality exist in the CMFFs: primary distortion of the crystal lattice forms twisted nanoflakes, and secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes forms fan&#8208;shaped nanoplates. At temperatures below 30&#8197;K, the CMFFs exhibited metallic conductivity and insulation for one handedness and the other, respectively. The chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields were speculated to stabilize the opposite spin in the antipodal chiral frame, which led to the free transport of electrons in one handedness of the chiral structure and immobility for the other handedness.

         <title>The Hydrates of TEMPO: Water Vibrations Reveal Radical Microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mono&#8208; and dihydrates of the persistent TEMPO radical are vibrationally characterized at low temperature without environment, also by analogy to the closed shell ketone analogue from which it is formally obtained by replacing the C by an N atom.







Abstract
An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analogue, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.

         <title>Discovery of Neuritogenic Securinega Alkaloids from Flueggea suffruticosa by a Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Network Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy was first presented and resulted in the discovery of three novel Securinega alkaloids. Compound 1 characterized an unprecedented 8/5/6/5/6/6/6/6&#8208;fused octacyclic scaffold with a unique cage&#8208;shaped 3&#8208;azatricyclo[6.4.0.03,11]dodecane core, which also exhibited remarkable effect on neuronal differentiation and neurite extension.







Abstract
A combined strategy of building blocks recognition and molecular network construction, termed the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN), was first presented to facilitate the efficient discovery of novel natural products. By mapping the BBMN of the total alkaloid fraction of Flueggea suffruticosa, three Securinega alkaloids (SEAs) with unusual chemical architectures, suffranidines&#8197;A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), were discovered and isolated. Compound 1 characterizes an unprecedented 8/5/6/5/6/6/6/6&#8208;fused octacyclic scaffold with a unique cage&#8208;shaped 3&#8208;azatricyclo[6.4.0.03,11]dodecane core. Compounds 2 and 3 are highly modified SEA dimers that incorporate additional C6 motifs. A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for 1&#8211;3 was proposed. In addition, 1 significantly induced neuronal differentiation and neurite extension by upregulating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)&#8208;mediated protein synthesis.

         <title>The Mechanism of Dehydrating Bimodules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Biosynthesis: A Showcase Study on Hepatoprotective Hangtaimycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hangtaimycin biosynthesis proceeds through a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery that contains a distinctive dehydrating bimodules. Here we present detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules that are generally involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides with Z double bonds. This work lays the foundations for future structural modifications by protein engineering.







Abstract
A bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation led to the isolation of hangtaimycin (HTM) from Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 and the discovery of its hepatoprotective properties. Structure elucidation by NMR suggested the need for a structural revision. A putative HTM degradation product was also isolated and its structure was confirmed by total synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and resembles a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery whose first PKS enzyme contains an internal dehydrating bimodule, which is usually found split in other trans&#8208;AT PKSs. The mechanisms of such dehydrating bimodules have often been proposed, but have never been deeply investigated. Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.

Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
polycyclic heteroaromatics containing multiple embedded boron (B)&#8208; and nitrogen (N)&#8208;atoms and featuring hybridized &#960;&#8208;bonding/ non&#8208;bonding molecular orbitals are constructed. They have enhanced electronic coupling for deep&#8208;red emission almost reaching the red&#8208;corner of CIE coordinates diagram and an induced multiple resonance (MR) effect to create a shallow potential energy surface, fundamentally overcoming the energy gap law.







Abstract
Efficient organic emitters in the deep&#8208;red region are rare due to the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221;. Herein, multiple boron (B)&#8208; and nitrogen (N)&#8208;atoms embedded polycyclic heteroaromatics featuring hybridized &#960;&#8208;bonding/ non&#8208;bonding molecular orbitals are constructed, providing a way to overcome the above luminescent boundary. The introduction of B&#8208;phenyl&#8208;B and N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N structures enhances the electronic coupling of those para&#8208;positioned atoms, forming restricted &#960;&#8208;bonds on the phenyl&#8208;core for delocalized excited states and thus a narrow energy gap. The mutually ortho&#8208;positioned B&#8208; and N&#8208;atoms also induce a multi&#8208;resonance effect on the peripheral skeleton for the non&#8208;bonding orbitals, creating shallow potential energy surfaces to eliminate the high&#8208;frequency vibrational quenching. The corresponding deep&#8208;red emitters with peaks at 662 and 692&#8197;nm exhibit narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums of 38&#8197;nm, high radiative decay rates of ca. 108&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#8776;100&#8201;% photo&#8208;luminescence quantum yields and record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies of ca. 28&#8201;% in a normal planar organic light&#8208;emitting diode structure, simultaneously.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and regulation of the tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase in whole&#160;E. coli&#160;cells was investigated by using advanced EPR spectroscopy. This radical starts the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks, and thus involved in essential processes in life. The observations reported by M&#252;ge Kasanmascheff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102914) were surprising and exciting because the findings indicated a distinct radical distribution within the cells pointing to a complex regulation mechanism of this fundamental enzyme in its native environment.

         <dc:description>
Mobilization upon cooling: Adsorbed on a copper surface, dimolybdenum tetraacetate molecules form an ordered structure of upright&#8208;standing molecules at room temperature. When cooling down to 220&#8197;K, the molecules become mobile on the surface. This counterintuitive phase transition from an ordered structure at high temperatures to a mobile phase at low temperatures can be explained by a smaller molar entropy in the mobile phase as compared to the ordered phase, as reported by Angelika K&#252;hnle et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105100).

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Effect in 1D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Bulk Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite single crystals are used to effectively distinguish the circularly polarized light in the near infrared region by chirality&#8208;dependent second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) effect with a high anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD=0.21).







Abstract
The introduction of chirality into organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) is expected to achieve excellent photoelectric and nonlinear materials related to circular dichroism. Owing to the existence of asymmetric center and intrinsic chirality in the chiral OIHPs, the different efficiencies of second harmonic generation (SHG) signal occurs when the circularly polarized light (CPL) with different phases passes through the chiral crystal, which is defined as second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Here, the SHG&#8208;CD effect is developed in bulk single crystals of chiral one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(R/S)&#8208;3&#8208;aminopiperidine]PbI4. It is the first time that CPL is distinguished using chirality&#8208;dependent SHG&#8208;CD effect in OIHPs bulk single crystals. Such SHG&#8208;CD technology extends the detection range to near infrared region (NIR). In this way, the anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) through SHG&#8208;CD signal is as high as 0.21.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Over Bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites anchored on Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 show a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity, as reported by Peng&#8197;Fei Liu, Zheng Jiang, Hua&#8197;Gui Yang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106874). Operando XAFS results and DFT calculations illustrate the bifunctional OER mechanism on the Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites: the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites facilitating a hydrogen atom tansfer to the adjacent Rh0 sites, which synergistically optimizes the OER energetics.

         <title>Tuning the Circular Dichroism and Circular Polarized Luminescence Intensities of Chiral 2D Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites through Halogenation of the Organic Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By incorporating various halogen (F, Cl, Br, and I)&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the effects of chiral molecules on chiroptical properties of hybrid organic inorganic perovskite (HOIP) are investigated. Among them, the HOIP having Cl&#8208;substituted chiral cation exhibits the highest circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) intensities, indicating the existence of the largest rotatory strength, whereas the F&#8208;substituted one shows the weakest intensities. The observed modulation can be correlated to the varied magnetic transition dipole of HOIPs, which is sensitive to the d&#8208;spacing between inorganic layers and the halogen&#8208;halogen interaction between organic cations and the inorganic sheets. Although a larger angular momentum of organic cation is expected as the atomic number of the  para&#8208;  substituent increases, the simultaneous increase in atom size enlarges the d&#8208;spacing of the HOIPs, thereby lowering the magnetic transition dipole. However, the strong halogen&#8208;halogen interaction existing in Cl&#8208;substituted system leads to a significantly increased rotational strength. These offsetting effects meet the optimal CD and CPL intensity with chlorine substitution, rendering the rotatory strength of HOIPs arranged in the order of (ClMBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(BrMBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(IMBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(MBA)  2  PbI  4  &gt;(FMBA)  2  PbI  4  . The modulation of the magnetic transition dipoles of HOIP paves the new avenue for designing hybrid perovskite&#8208;based spintronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Hydrogen Production and Transfer Hydrogenation with Selenite Promoted Electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;Nitrotoluenes to E&#8208;Nitroethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an electrochemical carbon&#8208;added reaction with accelerated kinetics to replace the low&#8208;value and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is markedly significant to pure hydrogen production. Regulating the critical steps to precisely design electrode materials to selectively synthesize targeted compounds is highly desirable. Here, inspired by the surfaced adsorbed SeO  x  2&#8208;  promoting OER, NiSe is demonstrated to be an efficient anode enabling &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene electrooxidation to E&#8208;nitroethene with up to 99% selectivity, 89% Faradic efficiency, and the reaction rate of 0.25 mmol cm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  via inhibiting side reactions for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen generation. The high performance can be associated with its in situ formed NiOOH surface layer and absorbed SeO  x  2&#8208;  via Se leaching&#8208;oxidation during electrooxidation, and the preferential adsorption of two &#8211;NO  2  groups of intermediate on NiOOH. A self&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;carbon radicals and subsequent elimination of a nitrite molecule pathway is proposed. Wide substrate scope, scale&#8208;up synthesis of E&#8208;nitroethene, and paired productions of E&#8208;nitroethene and hydrogen or N&#8208;protected aminoarenes over a bifunctional NiSe electrode highlight the promising potential. Gold also displays a similar promoting effect for &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene transformation like SeO  x  2&#8208;  , rationalizing the strategy of designing materials to suppress side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Oxidative&#8208;Cyanation of Aldehydes to Nitriles over Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative&#8208;cyanation of aldehydes provides a promising strategy for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of organic nitriles. Design of robust and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is the key for this route. Herein, we designed a series of Se,S,N&#8208;  tri  &#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with a hierarchical porous structure (denoted as Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;  x  ,  x  represents the pyrolysis temperature). It was found that the obtained Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;  1000  was very selective and efficient for oxidative&#8208;cyanation of various aldehydes including those containing other oxidizable groups into the corresponding nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource below 100  o  C. Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent performance of Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;  1000  originated mainly from the graphitic&#8208;N species with lower electron density and synergistic effect between the Se, S, N, and C in the catalyst. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure could also promote the reaction. Notably, the unique feature of this metal&#8208;free catalyst is that it tolerated other oxidizable groups, and showed no activity on further reaction of the products, thereby resulting in high selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first work for the synthesis of nitriles  via  oxidative&#8208;cyanation of aldehydes over heterogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Switch and Ethyl Group Formation in the Bacterial Polytrichastrene Synthase from Chryseobacterium polytrichastri</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reinvestigation of the linalool synthase from  Chryseobacterium polytrichastri  uncovered its diterpene synthase activity, yielding polytrichastrene A and polytrichastrol A with new skeletons, besides known wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene and thunbergol. The enzyme mechanism was investigated by isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations to explain an unusual ethyl group formation. Rationally designed exchanges of active site residues showed major functional switches, resulting for I66F in the production of five more new compounds, including polytrichastrene B and polytrichastrol B, while A87T, A192V and the double exchange A87T,A192V gave a product shift towards wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>{BiW8O30} Exerts Antitumor Effect by Triggering Pyroptosis and Upregulating Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. At 24 h post&#8208;incubation, the IC50 values of {BiW8} against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3 &#956;M, respectively. The IC50 value of {BiW8} on the MG63 cells was more than 2&#8208;fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by {BiW8}. {BiW8} increased 2&#8208;fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24 h post&#8208;incubation. Compared with 0 h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59%, 65%, 75%, 94%, and 97% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post&#8208;incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of {BiW8} were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a continuous need for novel microbial natural products to fill the drying&#8208;up drug development pipeline. Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules that consist of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a linear fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The experiments of genome sequencing, gene insertion mutation, isotope labelling, and precursor feeding demonstrated that the fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the origin of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole was related to the vitamin B12 metabolism. The convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways through a &#65279;C&#8208;N coupling led to the unique chemical framework of myxadazoles, which is an unprecedented hybridization mode in the paradigm of natural products. Myxadazoles exhibited potent vasculogenesis promotion effect and moderate antithrombotic activity, underscoring their potential usage for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Designable Assembly of Aluminum Molecular Rings for Sequential Confinement of Iodine Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although numerous adsorbent materials have been reported for radioactive iodine capture, demands for the development of new absorbents that are economically viable and featured with reliable synthetic protocols still exist. Herein, in this paper, a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy towards adsorbents for sequential confinement of iodine molecules is reported. It should be noticed that these adsorbents are versatile heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions and conjugated carboxylate ligands. Additionally, these materials can quickly remove iodine from cyclohexane solutions with a high removal rate (98.8%) and considerable loading capacity (555.06 mg/g). Heterometallic frameworks provided distinct pore sizes and binding sites toward iodine molecules and realize crystallographic visualization concerning sequential confinement of iodine molecules. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8208;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Potential Driven High&#8208;Throughput Molecular Electronic and Spintronic devices: From Molecules to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by assembling either single or ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis which is often termed &#8216;molecular electronics&#8217;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules offering an additional scope to create ultra&#8208;fast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular&#8208;thin films on a suitable electrode, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique emerges as highly efficient in various aspects. The key focus of this review is to describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven growth of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. Although there have been several bottlenecks with the scaling&#8208;up, fabrication and operational mechanism, still we foresee that the molecular devices can hold the potentials to compete against physical and economic barriers for commercial success soon.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Co&#8208;Mn Prussian Blue Analog Hollow Spheres for Efficient Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as reliable and promising cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), but they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to insufficient active sites and structural damage caused by the ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, a template&#8208;engaged ion exchange approach has been developed for the synthesis of Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich PBA hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) as cathode materials for AZIBs. Benefiting from the multiple advantageous features including hollow structure, abundant active sites, shortened diffusion path of electrons/Zn  2+  ions, and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode shows efficient zinc ion storage properties in terms of high capacity, decent rate capability and prolonged cycle life.</dc:description>

         <title>Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field boosts universal reduction of NOx&#8208; in water to ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NOx&#8208; reduction acts a pivotal part in sustaining globally balanced nitrogen cycle and restoring ecological environment, ammonia (NH3) is an excellent energy carrier and the most valuable product among all the products of NOx&#8208; reduction reaction, the selectivity of which is far from satisfaction due to the intrinsic complexity of multiple&#8208;electron NOx&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. Here, we utilize the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field, by the construction of high density of electron&#8208;deficient Ni nanoparticles inside nitrogen&#8208;rich carbons, to facilitate the enrichment and fixation of all NO  x  &#8208;  anions on the electrode surface, including NO  3  &#8208;  and NO  2  &#8208;  , and thus ensure the final selectivity to NH  3  . Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that NO  x  &#8208;  anions were continuously captured by the electrode with largely enhanced surface electric field, providing excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99 % from both electrocatalytic NO  3  &#8208;  &#160;and NO  2  &#8208;  reduction. Remarkably, the NH  3  yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1 mg h  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;2  in electrocatalytic&#160;NO  2  &#8208;  &#160;reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NO  x  &#8208;  pollutants, including seawater or waste water, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Enamide&#8208;Imine Tautomerism in the Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient protocol for kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols has been developed through an unprecedented asymmetric enamide&#8208;imine tautomerism process enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A broad range of racemic 2&#8208;arylsulfonamido tertiary allyl alcohols could be kinetically resolved with excellent kinetic resolution performances (with  s  &#8208;factor up to &gt;200). This method is particularly effective for a series of 1,1&#8208;dialkyl substituted allyl alcohols, which produced chiral tertiary alcohols that would be difficult to access via other asymmetric methods. Facile and versatile transformations of the chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imine and enamide products, especially the efficient stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino tertiary alcohols using one enantiomer of the catalyst, demonstrated the value of this kinetic resolution method.</dc:description>

         <title>Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C Hydrogen Bonds as Design Principle in Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secondary ligand metal interactions are decisive in many catalytic transformations. While arene&#8208;gold interactions have repeatedly been reported as critical structural feature in many high&#8208;performance gold catalysts, we herein report that these interactions can also be replaced by Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C hydrogen bonds without suffering any reduction in catalytic performance. Systematic experimental and computational studies on a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines featuring either a PPh  3  (  Ph  YPhos) or PCy  3  (  Cy  YPhos) moiety showed that the arene&#8208;gold interaction in the aryl&#8208;substituted compounds is efficiently compensated by the formation of Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C hydrogen bonds. The strongest interaction is found with the C&#8208;H moiety next to the onium center, which due to the polarization results in remarkably strong interactions with the shortest Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C hydrogen bonds reported to date. Calorimetric studies on the formation of the gold complexes further confirmed that the  Ph  YPhos and  Cy  YPhos ligands form similarly stable complexes. Consequently, both ligands showed the same catalytic performance in the hydroamination, hydro&#173;phe&#173;noxy&#173;lation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes, thus demon&#173;strating that Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C hydrogen bonds are equally suited for the generation of highly effective gold catalysts than gold&#8208;arene interactions. The generality of this observation was confirmed by a comparative study between a biaryl phosphine ligand and its cyclohexyl&#8208;substituted derivative, which again showed identical catalytic performance. These observations clearly support Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C hydrogen bonds as fundamental secondary interactions in gold catalysts, thus further increasing the number of design elements that can be used for future catalyst construction.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Decorated Platinum&#8211;Gallium Intermetallics as Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst design consisting of the double&#8208;decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra&#8208;stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature. PtGa&#8722;Ca&#8722;Pb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600&#8201;&#176;C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1&#8197;month.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt&#8208;based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at &#8805;600&#8201;&#176;C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three&#8208;fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron&#8208;enriched single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa&#8722;Ca&#8722;Pb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600&#8201;&#176;C (kd=0.00033&#8197;h&#8722;1, &#964;=3067&#8197;h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1&#8197;month for the first time.

         <title>Maximizing the Catalytic Performance of Pd@AuxPd1&#8722;x Nanocubes in H2O2 Production by Reducing Shell Thickness to Increase Compositional Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We address the issue of surface segregation of alloy electrocatalysts by conformally depositing the alloy as an ultrathin shell on shape&#8208;controlled nanocrystals. As a result of the optimized Au/Pd ratio in the shell and highly active {100} facets, we obtain Pd@Au0.95Pd0.05 nanocubes with superb performance in electrochemical H2O2 production.







Abstract
We report a simple route based upon seed&#8208;mediated growth to the synthesis of Pd@AuxPd1&#8722;x (0.8&#8804;x&#8804;1) core&#8211;shell nanocubes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined {100} facets and an optimal Au/Pd ratio for the surface, the nanocubes bearing a shell made of Au0.95Pd0.05 work as an efficient electrocatalyst toward H2O2 production, with high selectivity of 93&#8211;100&#8201;% in the low&#8208;overpotential region of 0.4&#8211;0.7&#8197;V. When the Au0.95Pd0.05 alloy is confined to a shell of only three atomic layers in thickness, the electrocatalyst is able to maintain its surface structure and elemental composition, endowing continuous and stable production of H2O2 during oxygen reduction at a high rate of 1.62&#8197;mol&#8201;g(Pd+Au)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a versatile route to the rational development of active and durable electrocatalysts based upon alloy nanocrystals.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Programming of Supramolecular Assemblies in Living Cells for Selective Cancer Cell Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integration of the endocytotic process and the overexpressing enzyme within lysosome in cancer cells, we construct enzymatic programmable assemblies selectively in living cancer cells for glioblastoma cancer therapy.







Abstract
Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration.

     alt="Structure-Based Programming of Supramolecular Assemblies in Living Cells for Selective Cancer Cell Inhibition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By integration of the endocytotic process and the overexpressing enzyme within lysosome in cancer cells, we construct enzymatic programmable assemblies selectively in living cancer cells for glioblastoma cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, western blot, and Bio-EM suggest the site-specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Aggregation Induced Emissive Carbon Dots Gels for Octopus&#8208;Inspired Shape/Color Synergistically Adjustable Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Palladium and Nickel Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization   and Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we install an azobenzene functionality in olefin polymerization catalysts and use light to modulate their properties via photoinduced trans&#8208;cis isomerization of the azobenzene moiety. The initially targeted azobenzene&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium and nickel catalysts are not photoresponsive. To address this issue, an imine&#8208;amine system bearing interrupted conjugation with the metal center, and a sandwich&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diimine system bearing an azobenzene unit at a position covalently far from the metal center were prepared and studied. We demonstrate that light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties. More interestingly, the light&#8208;mediated property changes were attributed to ligand electronic effects in one system and ligand steric effects in the other.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Synthetic Allomelanin Materials via Solid&#8208;State Polymerization of Self&#8208;Assembled 1,8&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17464-17471, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to achieve synthetic melanin materials with various well&#8208;defined architectures, ranging from spheres to anisotropic sheets and ellipsoidal platelets, is described. The specific shapes are obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the building blocks of melanins, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to render polymeric materials without changing the overall morphology.







Abstract
Melanosomes in nature have diverse morphologies, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization&#8208;Induced Nanoassemblies for Self&#8208;Augmented Cascade Chemotherapy and Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17570-17578, August 2, 2021. </description>

We reported a one&#8208;pot supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approach to fabricate H2O2&#8208;responsive nanomedicine with highly controllable drug loading and rapid clearance for self&#8208;augmented synergistic chemo/chemodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of chemodynamic therapy is impeded by the insufficient intracellular H2O2 level in tumor tissues. Herein, we developed a supramolecular nanoparticle via a simple one&#8208;step supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly process using platinum (IV) complex&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;ferrocene conjugates as supramolecular monomers. The supramolecular nanoparticles could dissociate rapidly upon exposure to endogenous H2O2 in the tumor and release hydroxyl radicals as well as platinum (IV) prodrugs in situ, which is reduced into cisplatin to significantly promote the generation of H2O2 in the tumor tissue. Thus, the supramolecular nanomedicine overcomes the limitation of conventional chemodynamic therapy via the self&#8208;augmented cascade radical generation and drug release. In addition, dissociated supramolecular nanoparticles could be readily excreted from the body via renal clearance to effectively avoid systemic toxicity and ensure long term biocompatibility of the nanomedicine. This work may provide new insights on the design and development of novel supramolecular nanoassemblies for cascade chemo/chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Has Anti&#8208;Proliferative Activity in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17514-17521, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is challenging, as it is involved in diseases via protein&#8208;protein interactions. Here, the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC MD13 is reported, which eliminates MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network by inducing MIF degradation. MD13 suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells by reducing MIF protein levels and MIF&#8208;related signaling, demonstrating the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in protein&#8208;protein interactions that play key roles in inflammation and cancer. Current strategies to develop small molecule modulators of MIF functions are mainly restricted to the MIF tautomerase active site. Here, we use this site to develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) in order to eliminate MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network. We report the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC, denoted MD13, which induced almost complete MIF degradation at low micromolar concentrations with a DC50 around 100&#8197;nM in A549 cells. MD13 suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells, which can be explained by deactivation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. MD13 also exhibits antiproliferative effect in a 3D tumor spheroid model. In conclusion, we describe the first MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC (MD13) as a research tool, which also demonstrates the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Scholl Reaction of Perylene&#8208;Based Polyphenylene Precursors under Different Conditions: Formation of Hexagon or Octagon?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17654-17663, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that Scholl reaction of a bis&#8208;perylene precursor gave either a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or a negatively curved PAH embedded with octagons, which can be explained by a radical cation or an arenium ion mechanism under different reaction conditions. The formed molecules show non&#8208;aggregative features and exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields.







Abstract
A planar dibenzo&#8208;peri&#8208;hexacene derivative (2) was synthesized via FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta&#8208;fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (1). However, an unexpected octagon&#8208;containing, negatively curved molecule (3) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO3H) were used. Similar results were observed when two smaller&#8208;sized precursors containing one (4) or two CP units (5) were tested. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis also revealed that there is no close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between neighboring &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons. DFT calculations suggest a radical cation mechanism in the presence of FeCl3 while an arenium ion pathway for the DDQ/MeSO3H mediated Scholl reaction, which can well explain the selective formation of hexagons and octagons under different conditions. The obtained compounds showed tunable optical and electrochemical properties.

         <title>CaMn3IVO4 Cubane Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex: Spin Ground States S&lt;9/2 and the Effect of Oxo Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17671-17679, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To better describe the Sn&#8208;state intermediates of Photosystem&#8197;II, a ferromagnetically coupled CaMn3IVO4 subunit with an S=9/2 ground state has been proposed. This assignment has played a key role in the mechanism of water oxidation, but electronic&#8208;structure studies of CaMn3IVO4 complexes remain rare. Through cluster desymmetrization or oxo protonation, lower spin ground states are found to be accessible, challenging prior models.







Abstract
We report the single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn3IVO4 and YMn3IVO4 complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC). The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on the spin&#8208;state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn3IVO4 complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be S=9/2. Desymmetrization of the pseudo&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric Ca(Y)Mn3IVO4 core leads to a lower S=5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an S=3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn3IVO3(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low&#8208;spin and high&#8208;spin forms of the S2 state is pH&#8208;dependent, suggesting that the (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin&#8208;state changes.

         <title>Facet Selectivity Guided Assembly of Nanoarchitectures onto Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17564-17569, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective nanostructure was constructed by assembly of anisotropic upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2DMOFs) nanosheets. The UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures possess facet selectivity and they display specific optical properties that are advantageous in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.







Abstract
Facet&#8208;selective nanostructures in living systems usually exhibit outstanding optical and enzymatic properties, playing important roles in photonics, matter exchange, and biocatalysis. Bioinspired construction of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures offers great opportunities for sophisticated nanomaterials, but remains a formidable task. We have developed a macromolecule&#8208;mediated strategy for the assembly of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)/two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2DMOFs) heterostructures with facet selectivity. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can be utilized as an interface&#8208;selective mediator to further promote the facet&#8208;selective assembly of MOFs onto the surface of UCNPs. The UCNPs/2DMOFs nanostructures with facet selectivity display specific optical properties and show great advantages in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Our demonstration of UCNPs/2DMOFs provides a vivid example for the controlled fabrication of facet&#8208;selective nanostructures and can promote the development of advanced functional materials for applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and information assurance.

Polymersomes with inherent aggregation&#8208;induced emission are presented that have mitochondrial targeting capacity due to the presence of pyridinium groups. The AIEgenic polymersomes, upon encapsulation of photosensitizers, show efficient energy transfer to enable photodynamic therapy, which improves the therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Biodegradable nanostructures displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) are desirable from a biomedical point of view, due to the advantageous features of loading capacity, emission brightness, and fluorescence stability. Herein, biodegradable polymers comprising poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;P(CLgTMC)), with tetraphenylethylene pyridinium&#8208;TMC (PAIE) side chains have been developed, which self&#8208;assembled into well&#8208;defined polymersomes. The resultant AIEgenic polymersomes are intrinsically fluorescent delivery vehicles. The presence of the pyridinium moiety endows the polymersomes with mitochondrial targeting ability, which improves the efficiency of co&#8208;encapsulated photosensitizers and improves therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This contribution showcases the ability to engineer AIEgenic polymersomes with structure inherent fluorescence and targeting capacity for enhanced photodynamic therapy.

A noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) NoCA&#8208;5 containing two terminal side&#8208;chains (T&#8208;SCs) is reported. Introduction of T&#8208;SCs can improve molecular rigidity, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value and lower reorganization free energy. Combining noncovalent conformational locks and T&#8208;SC engineering, the NoCA&#8208;5&#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82&#8201;% and a certified PCE of 14.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering is an effective strategy to regulate the solubility and packing behavior of organic materials. Recently, a unique strategy, so&#8208;called terminal side&#8208;chain (T&#8208;SC) engineering, has attracted much attention in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), but there is a lack of deep understanding of the mechanism. Herein, a new noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) containing two T&#8208;SCs (NoCA&#8208;5) was designed and synthesized. Introduction of T&#8208;SCs can enhance molecular rigidity and intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which is confirmed by the smaller Stokes shift value, lower reorganization free energy, and shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance in comparison to NoCA&#8208;1. Hence, the NoCA&#8208;5&#8208;based device exhibits a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.82&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 14.5&#8201;%, resulting from a high electron mobility, a short charge&#8208;extraction time, a small Urbach energy (Eu), and a favorable phase separation.

         <title>Li2S6&#8208;Integrated PEO&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17701-17706, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S6 is used as an additive for a PEO&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte and serves to improve the Li+&#8208;ion conductivity of the electrolyte by reducing the crystalline volume in the PEO as well as aiding in the formation of a thin stable layer that stabilizes the interface with lithium metal. This leads to an impressive electrochemical performance at 40&#8201;&#176;C in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells with a lithium metal anode and an LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode.







Abstract
The integration of Li2S6 within a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is demonstrated to improve the polymer electrolyte's ionic conductivity because the strong interplay between O2&#8722;(PEO) and Li+ from Li2S6 reduces the crystalline volume within the PEO. The Li/electrolyte interface is stabilized by the in situ formation of an ultra&#8208;thin Li2S/Li2S2 layer via the reaction between Li2S6 and lithium metal, which increases the ionic transport at the interface and suppresses lithium dendrite growth. A symmetric Li/Li cell with the Li2S6&#8208;integrated composite electrolyte has excellent cyclability and a high critical current density of 0.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 and high&#8208;voltage Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells at 40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Archaeal Lipid Parallel GDGT&#8208;0 (Isocaldarchaeol)**
</title>

A rapid, enantioselective synthesis of parallel GDGT&#8208;0 is reported using a global asymmetric hydrogenation to set all 16 methyl stereocenters. An unprecedented macrolactonization&#8208;hydrosilylation sequence then constructs the 72&#8208;membered macrocyclic lipid. Desymmetrization enabled the synthesis of a GDGT&#8208;0 with different headgroups. Phase transition and self&#8208;assembly studies gave evidence that the lipids form fluid giant unilamellar vesicles.







Abstract
Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples. Herein, we report a concise and stereoselective synthesis of the archaeal tetraether lipid parallel GDGT&#8208;0 and the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of derivatives bearing different polar groups.

Total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol and comparison with the natural isolate has led to a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted. The synthesis featured an asymmetric intermolecular Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type alkylation to access the unusual 5&#8208;6&#8208;ring motif as well as a late stage ring&#8208;closing metathesis to access the 66&#8208;membered macrocycle of crenarchaeol.







Abstract
Crenarchaeol is a glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipid produced exclusively in Archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota. This membrane&#8208;spanning lipid is undoubtedly the structurally most sophisticated of all known archaeal lipids and an iconic molecule in organic geochemistry. The 66&#8208;membered macrocycle possesses a unique chemical structure featuring 22 mostly remote stereocenters, and a cyclohexane ring connected by a single bond to a cyclopentane ring. Herein we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol. Comparison with natural crenarchaeol allowed us to propose a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted.

         <title>3D&#8208;Positioning of Nanoparticles in High&#8208;Curvature Block Copolymer Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17539-17546, August 2, 2021. </description>

By directly linking nanoparticles to block copolymers, defined three&#8208;dimensional nanoparticle assemblies can be realized within domain unit cells. The block length ratio is the most important parameter determining the lattice type. Volume fractions of domains with large positive curvature of only one percent are already sufficient to destabilize lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces.







Abstract
The defined assembly of nanoparticles in polymer matrices is an important precondition for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Here we demonstrate that a defined three&#8208;dimensional nanoparticle assembly within the unit cells can be realized by directly linking the nanoparticles to block copolymers. We show that for a range of nearly symmetric to unsymmetric block copolymers there are only two formed structures, a hexagonal lattice of P6/mmm&#8208;symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in 1D&#8208;arrays within the cylindrical domains, and a cubic lattice of Im3m&#8208;symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in the octahedral voids of a BCC&#8208;lattice, corresponding to the structure of ferrite steel. We observe the block length ratio and thus the interfacial curvature to be the most important parameter determining the lattice type. This is rationalized in terms of minimal chain extension such that domain topologies with large positive curvature are highly preferred. Already volume fractions of only one percent are sufficient to destabilize a lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces. The study thus demonstrates how nanoparticles can be located on well&#8208;defined positions in three&#8208;dimensional unit cells of block copolymer nanocomposites. This opens the way to functional 3D&#8208;nanocomposites where the nanoparticles need to be located on defined matrix positions.

Volume fractions of domains with large positive curvature of only one percent are already sufficient to destabilize lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defined assembly of nanoparticles in polymer matrices is an important precondition for next-generation functional materials. Here we demonstrate that a defined three-dimensional nanoparticle assembly within the unit cells can be realized by directly linking the nanoparticles to block copolymers. We show that for a range of nearly symmetric to unsymmetric block copolymers there are only two formed structures, a hexagonal lattice of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6/&lt;i&gt;mmm&lt;/i&gt;-symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in 1D-arrays within the cylindrical domains, and a cubic lattice of Im3m-symmetry, where the nanoparticles are located in the octahedral voids of a BCC-lattice, corresponding to the structure of ferrite steel. We observe the block length ratio and thus the interfacial curvature to be the most important parameter determining the lattice type. This is rationalized in terms of minimal chain extension such that domain topologies with large positive curvature are highly preferred. Already volume fractions of only one percent are sufficient to destabilize a lamellar structure and favor the formation of highly curved interfaces. The study thus demonstrates how nanoparticles can be located on well-defined positions in three-dimensional unit cells of block copolymer nanocomposites. This opens the way to functional 3D-nanocomposites where the nanoparticles need to be located on defined matrix positions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Separation of Hexachloroplatinate(IV) Dianions Based on Exo&#8208;Binding with Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17587-17594, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization protocol relying on the selective recognition of the [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions by the exo&#8208;binding of cucurbit[6]uril has been demonstrated. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal scrap in a fast, efficient, and highly selective manner.







Abstract
The recognition and separation of anions attracts attention from chemists, materials scientists, and engineers. Employing exo&#8208;binding of artificial macrocycles to selectively recognize anions remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. We report the instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization and concomitant co&#8208;precipitation between [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions and cucurbit[6]uril, which relies on the selective recognition of these dianions through noncovalent bonding interactions on the outer surface of cucurbit[6]uril. The selective [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianion recognition is driven by weak [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C] hydrogen bonding and [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O] ion&#8211;dipole interactions. The synthetic protocol is highly selective. Recognition is not observed in combinations between cucurbit[6]uril and six other Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208; or Rh&#8208;based chloride anions. We also demonstrated that cucurbit[6]uril is able to separate selectively [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions from a mixture of [PtCl6]2&#8722;, [PdCl4]2&#8722;, and [RhCl6]3&#8722; anions. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal waste.

         <title>Precise Identification and Characterization of Catalytically Active Sites on the Surface of &#947;&#8208;Alumina**
</title>

&#947;&#8208;Alumina is one of the oldest and largest&#8208;scale commercial catalytic materials, but the precise identification of its catalytically active sites has remained elusive. With the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FTIR, high&#8208;field solid state NMR, and HRTEM techniques, clarification of the nature of the active sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina is proposed.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability. These attributes enabled its use as the first commercial large&#8208;scale heterogeneous catalyst for ethanol dehydration. Despite progress in materials characterization the nature of the specific sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina that are responsible for its unique catalytic properties has remained obscure and controversial. By using combined infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we identify the octahedral, amphoteric (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites on the (100) segments of massively restructured (110) facets on typical rhombus&#8208;platelet &#947;&#8208;alumina as well as the (100) segments of irrational surfaces (invariably always present in all &#947;&#8208;alumina samples) responsible for its unique catalytic activity. Such (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites are also present on the macroscopically defined (100) facets of &#947;&#8208;alumina with elongated/rod&#8208;like geometry. The mechanism by which these sites lose &#8208;OH groups upon thermal dehydroxylation resulting in coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al+3O5 sites is clarified. These coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al sites produce well&#8208;defined thermally stable Al&#8208;carbonyl complexes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina and their role as catalytically active sites.

An efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing practical and easy access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity as rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
As a fundamental type of carbonylation reaction, the alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons constitutes one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. However, owing to the difficulties in controlling multi&#8208;selectivities for asymmetric hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, this reaction is typically limited to vinylarenes and analogues. In this work, a highly efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing practical and easy access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity from broadly available alkenes, CO, and nucleophiles (&gt;90 examples, 84&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). This protocol features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and the products can be readily transformed into a diverse array of chiral heterocycles. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity, which facilitates chiral induction by coordination to the transition metal as rationalized by DFT calculations. The strategy of utilizing an innate functional group as the directing group on the alkene substrate might find further applications in catalytic asymmetric hydrocarbonylation reactions.

A cation&#8211;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte simultaneously resolves the problems at both the Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Benefitting from the electrolyte solvation structure, a long&#8208;life and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell was prepared.

Abstract
Sulfur chemistry based on solid&#8211;liquid dissolution&#8208;deposition route inevitably encounters shuttle of lithium polysulfides, its parasitic interaction with lithium (Li) anode and flood electrolyte environment. The sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) cathode favors solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism in carbonate ester electrolytes but fails to pair high&#8208;capacity Li anode. Herein, we rationally design a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte to simultaneously resolve the problems of both Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly suppressed solvent activity and a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated structure (molar ratio 1:1). Consequently, Li electrodeposit evolves into round&#8208;edged morphology, LiF&#8208;rich interphase, and high reversibility. Moreover, S@pPAN cathode inherits a neat solid&#8208;phase redox reaction and fully eliminated the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. Finally, we harvest a long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S@pPAN pouch cell with slight Li metal excessive (0.4 time) and ultra&#8208;lean electrolyte design (1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgS&#8722;1), delivering 394&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 energy density based on electrodes and electrolyte mass.

Consequently, Li electrodeposit evolves into round-edged morphology, LiF-rich interphase, and high reversibility. Moreover, S@pPAN cathode inherits a neat solid-phase redox reaction and fully eliminated the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. Finally, we harvest a long-life Li-S@pPAN pouch cell with slight Li metal excessive (0.4 time) and ultra-lean electrolyte design (1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), delivering 394&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; energy density based on electrodes and electrolyte mass.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Branched Aromatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17680-17685, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transaminase&#8208;based dynamic kinetic resolution was developed for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;branched aromatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The reaction was facilitated by the use of a thermophilic enzyme that tolerates elevated temperatures and pH values and exhibits broad substrate promiscuity. The utility of the process was demonstrated in the total synthesis of jomthonic acid&#8197;A (see scheme).







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched noncanonical amino acids are valuable molecules in modern drug development efforts. However, they are still challenging to prepare due to the need to set multiple stereocenters in a stereoselective fashion, and contemporary methods for the synthesis of such compounds often rely on the use of rare&#8208;transition&#8208;metal catalysts with designer ligands. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic transamination method to prepare a broad range of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies show that the transformation proceeds through dynamic kinetic resolution that is unique to the optimal enzyme. To highlight its utility and practicality, the biocatalytic reaction was applied to the synthesis of several sp3&#8208;rich cyclic fragments and the first total synthesis of jomthonic acid&#8197;A.

         <title>Phosphorus and Arsenic Atom Transfer to Isocyanides to Form &#960;&#8208;Backbonding Cyanophosphide and Cyanoarsenide Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17595-17600, August 2, 2021. </description>

Pnictogen atom transfer from Na(OCE) salts (E=P, As) to a TiII&#8208;bound isocyanide provides entry to phosphorus and arsenic analogues of organic isothiocyanates. The low&#8208;coordinate and highly reducing TiII complex, [(TptBu,Me)TiCl], promotes these reactions by trapping the so&#8208;formed cyanophosphide and cyanoarsenide ligands, which display an unusual &#951;3&#8208;coordination mode due to &#960;&#8208;backbonding.







Abstract
Decarbonylation along with E atom transfer from Na(OCE) (E=P, As) to an isocyanide coordinated to the tetrahedral TiII complex [(TptBu,Me)TiCl], yielded the [(TptBu,Me)Ti(&#951;3&#8208;ECNAd)] species (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl, TptBu,Me&#8722;=hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate). In the case of E=P, the cyanophosphide ligand displays nucleophilic reactivity toward Al(CH3)3; moreover, its bent geometry hints to a reduced Ad&#8722;NCP3&#8722; resonance contributor. The analogous and rarer mono&#8208;substituted cyanoarsenide ligand, Ad&#8722;NCAs3&#8722;, shows the same unprecedented coordination mode but with shortening of the N=C bond. As opposed to TiII, VII fails to promote P atom transfer to AdNC, yielding instead [(TptBu,Me)V(OCP)(CNAd)]. Theoretical studies revealed the rare ECNAd moieties to be stabilized by &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions with the former TiII ion, and their assembly to most likely involve a concerted E atom transfer between Ti&#8208;bound OCE&#8722; to AdNC ligands when studying the reaction coordinate for E=P.

         <title>Isoreticular Crystallization of Highly Porous Cubic Covalent Organic Cage Compounds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17455-17463, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoreticular porous materials are obtained after crystallization of cubic organic cages with varying alkyl chains at the edges. Nitrogen sorption measurements revealed exceptionally high surface areas up to 3426&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volumes up to 1.84&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. The intricate three&#8208;dimensional array of alternating intrinsic and extrinsic pores remains intact upon solvent removal and pore sizes are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents.







Abstract
Modular frameworks featuring well&#8208;defined pore structures in microscale domains establish tailor&#8208;made porous materials. For open molecular solids however, maintaining long&#8208;range order after desolvation is inherently challenging, since packing is usually governed by only a few supramolecular interactions. Here we report on two series of nanocubes obtained by co&#8208;condensation of two different hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacenes (TBTQs) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acids (BDBAs) with varying linear alkyl chains in 2,5&#8208;position. n&#8208;Butyl groups at the apical position of the TBTQ vertices yielded soluble model compounds, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, methyl&#8208;substituted cages spontaneously crystallized as isostructural and highly porous solids with BET surface areas and pore volumes of up to 3426&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1.84&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and sorption measurements revealed an intricate cubic arrangement of alternating micro&#8208; and mesopores in the range of 0.97&#8211;2.2&#8197;nm that are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents at the BDBA linker.

         <title>Ultralight Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17547-17555, August 2, 2021. </description>

Ultralight electrolytes with a density of 0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 were proposed by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether. A weight reduction of more than 30&#8201;% per volume was realized relative to the conventional electrolyte, also enabling Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. When applied in pouch cells, &#8776;20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved at various E/S ratios.







Abstract
The high weight fraction of the electrolyte in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cell is the primary reason its specific energy is much below expectations. Thus far, it is still a challenge to reduce the electrolyte volume of Li&#8211;S batteries owing to their high cathode porosity and electrolyte depletion from the Li metal anode. Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Compared to Li&#8211;S batteries using conventional counterparts (&#8776;1.2&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), the Li&#8211;S pouch cells equipped with our ultralight electrolyte could achieve an ultralow electrolyte weight/capacity ratio (E/C) of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1 and realize a 19.2&#8201;% improvement in specific energy (from 329.9 to 393.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) under E/S=3.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Moreover, more than 20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved using our ultralight electrolyte at various E/S ratios.

Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83&#8197;g&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) by introducing a weakly-coordinating and Li-compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li&#8211;S pouch cell functionality under lean-electrolyte conditions. Compared to Li&#8211;S batteries using conventional counterparts (&#8776;1.2&#8197;g&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the Li&#8211;S pouch cells equipped with our ultralight electrolyte could achieve an ultralow electrolyte weight/capacity ratio (E/C) of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and realize a 19.2&#8201;% improvement in specific energy (from 329.9 to 393.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under E/S=3.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, more than 20&#8201;% improvement in specific energy could be achieved using our ultralight electrolyte at various E/S ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanosynthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Cocrystals: Tuning Order, Functionality and Size in Cocrystal Design**
</title>

Mechanosynthesis gives ternary and quaternary hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic cocrystals held together via synergistic intermolecular interactions. Notably, higher&#8208;order ternary and quaternary cocrystals can be readily obtained either via serial synthetic routes from the individual components or via one&#8208;pot approaches.







Abstract
The ability to rationally design and predictably construct crystalline solids has been the hallmark of crystal engineering research. To date, numerous examples of multicomponent crystals comprising organic molecules have been reported. However, the crystal engineering of cocrystals comprising both organic and inorganic chemical units is still poorly understood and mostly unexplored. Here, we report a new diverse set of higher&#8208;order cocrystals (HOCs) based on the structurally versatile&#8212;yet largely unexplored&#8212;phosph(V/V)azane heterosynthon building block. The novel ternary and quaternary cocrystals reported are held together by synergistic and orthogonal intermolecular interactions. Notably, the HOCs can be readily obtained either via sequential or one&#8208;pot mechanochemical methods. Computational modelling methods reveal that the HOCs are thermodynamically driven to form and that their mechanical properties strongly depend on the composition and intermolecular forces in the crystal, offering untapped potential for optimizing material properties.

         <title>Highly Controlled Janus Organic&#8208;Inorganic Nanocomposite as a Versatile Photoacoustic Platform</title>

We developed a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture following a self&#8208;assembly approach, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of PA agents, combined modular PA properties, and independent responsiveness.







Abstract
Controlling the structural order of nanoparticles (NPs), morphology, and composition is of paramount significance in tailoring the physical properties of nanoassembly. However, the commonly reported symmetrical nanocomposites often suffer an interference or sacrifice of the photophysical properties of the original components. To address this challenge, we developed a novel type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of components, combined modular optical properties, and independent stimuli. As a proof of concept, JNCPs were prepared by incorporating two photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents, namely an organic semiconducting dye and responsive gold nanoparticles (AuNP) assembly in separate compartments of JNCP. Theoretical simulation results confirmed that the formation mechanism of JNCPs arises from the entropy equilibrium in the system. The AuNP assembly generated a PA images with the variation of pH, while the semiconducting molecule served as an internal PA standard agent, leading to ratiometric PA imaging of pH. JNCP based probe holds great potential for real&#8208;time and accurate detection of diverse biological targets in living systems.

         <title>Bridging Thermal Catalysis and Electrocatalysis: Catalyzing CO2 Conversion with Carbon&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17472-17480, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite similar underlying phenomena, studies that directly analogize between thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis are rare. Here, we employ a Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst that is thermally stable and electronically conductive to show that high selectivity CO production is observed under both electrochemical CO2 reduction conditions and thermal reverse&#8208;water gas shift environments.







Abstract
Understanding the differences between reactions driven by elevated temperature or electric potential remains challenging, largely due to materials incompatibilities between thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic environments. We show that Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon (NiPACN), an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2R), can also selectively catalyze thermal CO2 to CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) representing a direct analogy between catalytic phenomena across the two reaction environments. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that NiPACN likely facilitates RWGS on dispersed Ni sites in agreement with CO2R active site studies. Finally, we construct a generalized reaction driving&#8208;force that includes temperature and potential and suggest that NiPACN could facilitate faster kinetics in CO2R relative to RWGS due to lower intrinsic barriers. This report motivates further studies that quantitatively link catalytic phenomena across disparate reaction environments.

Cyclo&#8208;archaeol, iso&#8208;caldarchaeol, caldarchaeol, and mycoketide are prepared by employing asymmetric hydrogenation to generate the multiple stereocenters.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy par excellence to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established 13C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.

         <title>Au/Pt&#8208;Egg&#8208;in&#8208;Nest Nanomotor for Glucose&#8208;Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17579-17586, August 2, 2021. </description>

Hollow Au/Pt&#8208;based nanostructures, resembling an &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology, have been synthesized by a dynamic&#8208;casting approach utilizing a silica yolk&#8208;shell cast. These nanosized motors can propel themselves in response to biocompatible glucose as fuel, via a catalytic cascade oxidation reaction. In response to autonomous motion, they can effectively internalize into living cells, and deliver the cargo anti&#8208;cancer drug molecules efficiently.







Abstract
Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt&#8208;based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology (Au/Pt&#8208;ENs), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme&#8208;relay&#8208;like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular&#8208;laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic&#8208;casting approach using silica yolk&#8208;shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au&#8208;seed fixing the silica&#8208;yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt&#8208;dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest&#8208;like morphology, Au/Pt&#8208;ENs exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose&#8208;converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor&#8208;membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of Au/Pt&#8208;ENs facilitated the drug&#8208;molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.

     alt="Au/Pt-Egg-in-Nest Nanomotor for Glucose-Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollow Au/Pt-based nanostructures, resembling an &#8220;&lt;i&gt;egg-in-nest&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; morphology, have been synthesized by a dynamic-casting approach utilizing a silica yolk-shell cast. These nanosized motors can propel themselves in response to biocompatible glucose as fuel, via a catalytic cascade oxidation reaction. In response to autonomous motion, they can effectively internalize into living cells, and deliver the cargo anti-cancer drug molecules efficiently.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt-based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8220;egg-in-nest&#8221; morphology (&lt;b&gt;Au/Pt-EN&lt;/b&gt;s), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme-relay-like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular-laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic-casting approach using silica yolk-shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au-seed fixing the silica-yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt-dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest-like morphology, &lt;b&gt;Au/Pt-EN&lt;/b&gt;s exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose-converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor-membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of &lt;b&gt;Au/Pt-EN&lt;/b&gt;s facilitated the drug-molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthetic Zippers as an Enabling Tool for Engineering of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases**
</title>

Re&#8208;engineering of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is challenging due to their protein size up to a few megadalton. The artificial splitting of NRPSs to produce building blocks with moderate size is achieved by the introduction of synthetic zippers, which can be recombined in a rapid and simple plug and play manner to form an in trans regulated synthetic type of NRPSs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs. Efficient engineering of these often giant biosynthetic machineries to produce novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is an ongoing challenge. Here we describe a cloning and co&#8208;expression strategy to functionally combine NRPS fragments of Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive origin, synthesising novel peptides at titres up to 220&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Extending from the recently introduced definition of eXchange Units (XUs), we inserted synthetic zippers (SZs) to split single protein NRPSs into independently expressed and translated polypeptide chains. These synthetic type of NRPS (type S) enables easier access to engineering, overcomes cloning limitations, and provides a simple and rapid approach to building peptide libraries via the combination of different NRPS subunits.

         <title>Photo&#8208;driven Oxygen Vacancies Extends Charge Carrier Lifetime for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17601-17607, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocharging/discharging strategy is used to initiate the WO3 electrode and prolong charge carrier lifetime for the oxygen evolution reaction. A WO3/CuO photoanode exhibited an outstanding photocurrent with a low onset potential. The prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO3 and the electronic systems of photocharged WO3/CuO semiconductors were clarified using the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain DFT.







Abstract
A photocharge/discharge strategy is proposed to initiate the WO3 photoelectrode and suppress the main charge recombination, which remarkably improves the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The photocharged WO3 surrounded by a 8&#8211;10&#8197;nm overlayer and oxygen vacancies could be operated more than 25&#8197;cycles with 50&#8197;h durability without significant decay on PEC activity. A photocharged WO3/CuO photoanode exhibits an outstanding photocurrent of 3.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE with a low onset potential of 0.6&#8197;VRHE, which is one of the best performances of p&#8208;n heterojunction structure. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain DFT, we clarify the prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO3, as well as how electronic systems of photocharged WO3/CuO semiconductors enable the effective photoinduced electrons transfer from WO3 into CuO. This work provides a feasible route to address excessive defects existed in photoelectrodes without causing extra recombination.

         <title>SO2 Capture Using Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17556-17563, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cages (POCs) were investigated for the first time for the capture of SO2. A tertiary amine cage (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated remarkably high SO2 capture that was perfectly reversible for at least 50 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles.







Abstract
We report the first experimental investigation of porous organic cages (POCs) for the demanding challenge of SO2 capture. Three structurally related N&#8208;containing cage molecular materials were studied. An imine&#8208;functionalized POC (CC3) showed modest and reversible SO2 capture, while a secondary&#8208;amine POC (RCC3) exhibited high but irreversible SO2 capture. A tertiary amine POC (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated very high SO2 capture (13.78&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1; 16.4&#8201;SO2 molecules per cage) combined with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles. The adsorption behavior was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, 13C&#8197;CP&#8208;MAS NMR experiments, and computational calculations.

         <title>Visualizing Element Migration over Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts and its Impact on Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17735-17743, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic behaviors of bifunctional oxide&#8208;zeolite catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 were significantly influenced by element migration, which was dependent on the type of oxides and affected synergy of the two functional components.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In2O3, ZnO, Cr2O3, and ZrO2) to combine with H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 for the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion&#8208;exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C2+ hydrocarbon products over In2O3/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZnO/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr2O3/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZrO2/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts with high selectivity of C2+ hydrocarbons.

         <title>Capturing Visible Light in Low&#8208;Band&#8208;Gap C4N&#8208;Derived Responsive Bifunctional Air Electrodes for Solar Energy Conversion and Storage</title>

A narrow&#8208;band&#8208;gap C4N material was explored as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) organic bifunctional oxygen catalyst for application in photocoupled secondary batteries. The C4N&#8208;enabled VLS rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZAB) and all&#8208;polymer polymer&#8208;air batteries (RPAB) exhibited markedly reduced charge voltage together with an increased energy efficiency under visible light.







Abstract
We report facile synthesis of low&#8208;band&#8208;gap mesoporous C4N particles and their use as responsive bifunctional oxygen catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (RZAB) and polymer&#8208;air battery (RPAB). Compared to widely studied g&#8208;C3N4, C4N shows a smaller band gap of 1.99&#8197;eV, with a larger photocurrent response, and it can function as visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna and bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) catalysts, enabling effective photocoupling to tune oxygen catalysis. The C4N&#8208;enabled VLS&#8208;RZAB displays a low charge voltage of 1.35&#8197;V under visible light, which is below the theoretical RZAB voltage of 1.65&#8197;V, corresponding to a high energy efficiency of 97.78&#8201;%. Pairing a C4N cathode with a polymer anode also endows an VLS&#8208;RPAB with light&#8208;boosted charge performance. It is revealed that the ORR and OER active sites in C4N are separate carbon sites near pyrazine&#8208;nitrogen atoms and photogenerated energetic holes can activate OER for improved reaction kinetics.

Guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C6F5)3/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er).







Abstract
The enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is efficient for constructing chiral tetrahydropyridines, but the catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ketimines with unactivated dienes is still a challenging topic. Herein, guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C6F5)3/chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction partners and hence offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives with pretty outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er). The reaction is very efficient: lowering catalyst loadings for the model reaction to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, enantioselectivity is still maintained. The synthetic utility was confirmed by transformations of the products. DFT calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.

         <title>Liposomes with Water as a pH&#8208;Responsive Functionality for Targeting of Acidic Tumor and Infection Sites</title>

A new lipid, DCPA, was prepared, possessing a hydrophilic, pyridine betaine group that can be hydrogen&#8208;bonded with water yielding DCPA&#8208;H2O. Self&#8208;assembled DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes become rapidly protonated at relatively high pH (&lt;7.0) due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H2O. As a result, DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes target faster to solid tumors and infectious biofilms than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes.







Abstract
A lipid named DCPA was synthesized under microwave&#8208;assisted heating. DCPA possesses a pyridine betaine, hydrophilic group that can be complexed with water through hydrogen bonding (DCPA&#8208;H2O). DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes became protonated relatively fast already at pH&lt;6.8, due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H2O. In murine models, DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes had longer blood circulation times than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes, while after tail&#8208;vein injection DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes targeted faster to solid tumors and intra&#8208;abdominal infectious biofilms. Therapeutic efficacy in a murine, infected wound&#8208;healing model of tail&#8208;vein injected ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes exceeded the ones of clinically applied ciprofloxacin as well as of ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DPPC or DCPM liposomes.

         <title>Highly Soluble Supertetrahedra upon Selective Partial Butylation of Chalcogenido Metalate Clusters in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17622-17628, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective access to partially butylated supertetrahedral clusters [Sn10O4S16(SBu)4]4&#8722; was achieved by employing a di&#8208;butylated ionic liquid as reaction medium and alkylation agent. In contrast to purely inorganic [Sn10O4S20]8&#8722;, the butylated analogs are soluble in solvents like CH2Cl2 or CH3CN, without losing the typical opto&#8208;electronic properties. Solution&#8208;NMR data were assigned with the help of newly developed all&#8208;electron relativistic DFT methods.







Abstract
Supertetrahedral clusters have been reported in two generally different types so far: one type possessing an organic ligand shell, no or low charges, and high solubility, while the other cluster type is ligand&#8208;free with usually high charges and low or no solubility in common solvents. The latter is a tremendous disadvantage regarding further use of the clusters in solution. However, as organic substituents usually broaden the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, which cannot be overcompensated by the (limited) cluster sizes, a full organic shielding comes along with drawbacks regarding opto&#8208;electronic properties. We therefore sought to find a way of generating soluble clusters with a minimum number of organic substituents. Here, we present the synthesis and full characterization of two salts of [Sn10O4S16(SBu)4]4&#8722; that are high soluble in CH2Cl2 or CH3CN, which includes first NMR and mass spectra obtained from solutions of such salts with mostly inorganic supertetrahedral clusters. The optical absorption properties of this new class of compounds indicates nearly unaffected band gaps. The synthetic approach and the spectroscopic findings were rationalized and explained by means of high&#8208;level quantum chemical studies.

Diverse branched supermicelles can be prepared by particle&#8211;particle connection of primary tapered worm&#8208;like aggregates from azobenzene&#8208;containing Janus molecular double brushes (MDBs), which further enables biomimetic morphology evolution from Antedon&#8208; to starfish&#8208;shaped architectures upon UV irradiation.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly is one of the most effective approaches to fabricate nature&#8208;inspired materials with subtle nanostructures. We report a distinct hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process of molecular double brushes (MDBs) with each graft site carrying a poly(azobenzene&#8208;acrylate) (PAzo) chain and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain. Asymmetric tapered worm (ATW) nanostructures with chain&#8208;end reactivity assembling from the azobenzene&#8208;derived MDBs serve as primary subunits to prepare branched supermicelles by increasing water content (Cw) in THF/water. Various natural Antedon&#8208;shaped multiarm worm&#8208;like aggregates (MWAs) can be created via the particle&#8211;particle connection of ATWs. Intriguingly, the azobenzene moieties undergo trans&#8211;cis isomerization upon UV irradiation and further promote a morphology evolution of MWAs. Multiscale supermicelles comprised of starfish shapes with differing central body and arm morphologies (e.g., compare to the biological specimens Luidia ciliaris and Crossaster papposus) were prepared by manipulating irradiation time.

         <title>Robust Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Defect Passivation and Control of Energy&#8208;Level Alignment for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A robust route simultaneously allows effective defect passivation and reduced energy difference between the valence band edge of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of strongly polar molecules at the perovskite/HTL interface.







Abstract
The ability to passivate defects and modulate the interface energy&#8208;level alignment (IEA) is key to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a robust route that simultaneously allows defect passivation and reduced energy difference between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of polar chlorine&#8208;terminated silane molecules at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) points to effective passivation of the halide vacancies on perovskite surface by the silane chlorine atoms. An integrated experimental and DFT study demonstrates that the dipole layer formed by the silane molecules decreases the perovskite work function, imparting an Ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. The corresponding PSCs manifest a nearly 20&#8201;% increase in power conversion efficiency over pristine devices and a markedly enhanced device stability. As such, the use of polar molecules to passivate defects and tailor the IEA in PSCs presents a promising platform to advance the performance of PSCs.

         <title>Enhanced Band Convergence and Ultra&#8208;Low Thermal Conductivity Lead to High Thermoelectric Performance in SnTe</title>

The high thermoelectric performance in SnTe is demonstrated via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and inhibition of the phonon propagation.







Abstract
SnTe, a structural analogue of champion thermoelectric (TE) material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for TE energy conversion. Herein, we demonstrate a co&#8208;doping strategy to improve the TE performance of SnTe via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and phonon transport. The electrical transport is optimized by 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ag doping in self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te). Further, Mg doping in SnAg0.03Te resulted in highly converged valence bands, which enhanced the Seebeck coefficient markedly. The energy gap between two uppermost valence bands (&#916;Ev) decreases to 0.10&#8197;eV in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te compared to 0.35&#8197;eV in pristine SnTe. The optimized p&#8208;type carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands gave a high power factor of ca. 27&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 865&#8197;K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te reached to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.23&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 865&#8197;K due to the formation of MgTe nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. These combined effects resulted in a high TE figure of merit, zT&#8776;1.55 at 865&#8197;K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te.

         <title>Tight Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport via Molecular Precursor Engineering</title>

The molecular precursor engineering was implemented for modular fabrication of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The COF membranes fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process with more hydrophilic aldehyde precursors exhibited tighter structure than the COF membranes fabricated via interfacial polymerization process with less hydrophilic aldehydes, thus achieving the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity.







Abstract
Fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membranes with tight structure, which can fully utilize well&#8208;defined framework structure and thus achieve superior conduction performance, remains a grand challenge. Herein, through molecular precursor engineering of COFs, we reported the fabrication of tight COFs membrane with the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity over 200&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 100&#8201;% RH. Six quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized COFs were synthesized by assembling functional hydrazides and different aldehyde precursors. In an organic&#8208;aqueous reaction system, the impact of the aldehyde precursors with different size, electrophilicity and hydrophilicity on the reaction&#8208;diffusion process for fabricating COFs membranes was elucidated. Particularly, more hydrophilic aldehydes were prone to push the reaction zone from the interface region to the aqueous phase of the reaction system, the tight membranes were thus fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process, conferring around 4&#8211;8 times the anion conductivity over the loose membranes via interfacial polymerization process.

Anisotropic synthetic melanins have been generated by solid&#8208;state polymerization, as reported by Nathan&#8197;C. Gianneschi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;17464. Ellipsoidal platelets of melanin, found to date only in biology, were obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the 4&#8208;4&#8242; dihydroxynaphthalene dimer as the building block, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to give polymeric melanin materials without changing their overall morphology.

         <dc:description>
The helical twisting power of neat as well as several surface&#8208;functionalized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs*), exhibiting innate molecular and structural chirality, was evaluated in a nematic liquid crystal as a reporter medium. In their Communication on page&#8197;17344, Diana P.&#8197;N. Gon&#231;alves and Torsten Hegmann report that all CNC* species were able to induce and amplify chirality at the nanoscale level, especially those functionalized with mesogenic molecules that better resembled the N&#8208;LC host molecules. Surface functionalization with chiral molecules did not appear to enhance the helical twisting power of the CNCs, thereby supporting the role of innate nanocrystal core chirality.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: SO2 Capture Using Porous Organic Cages (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 32/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17747-17747, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized porous organic cage (POC) demonstrating high SO2 capture capability and reversibility is reported by Andrew&#8197;I. Cooper, Ilich&#8197;A. Ibarra, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;17556. The main source of SO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels, and alkaline scrubber&#8208;based technologies are the main desulphurization methods in industry, which often cause corrosion of pipes and generate huge amounts of wastewater. With good processibility and proven scalability, POC materials offer a more sustainable option for SO2 capture.

Archaeal lipids have been prepared by iridium&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation, as reported by Adriaan&#8197;J. Minnaard et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;17497. Geranylgeraniol, extracted from Bixa orellana seeds, flows in the carafe with the iridium catalyst. The carafe symbolises Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, after which iridium has been named. The final products are poured from it. Mycoketide, produced by M.&#8197;tuberculosis, is depicted with a picture of the bacterium. The membrane&#8208;spanning lipids are represented by glucosylated caldarchaic acid, the grand prismatic spring in Yellowstone, and a picture of the prepared giant unilamellar vesicles.

         <title>Linking the Dynamic Chemical State of Catalysts with the Product Profile of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17254-17267, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical link between the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites (mixed Cu+&#8208; and Cu0&#8208;, Cu+&#8208;, and Cu0&#8208;dominated) and their unique selectivity toward the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (yielding C2H4/C2H5OH, CO/HCOO&#8722;, and CH4, respectively) is put forward. This may be a valuable tool for fine&#8208;tuning the Cu surface state toward distinct CO2RR pathways.







Abstract
The promoted activity and enhanced selectivity of electrocatalysts is commonly ascribed to specific structural features such as surface facets, morphology, and atomic defects. However, unraveling the factors that really govern the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is still very challenging since the surface state of electrocatalysts is dynamic and difficult to predict under working conditions. Moreover, theoretical predictions from the viewpoint of thermodynamics alone often fail to specify the actual configuration of a catalyst for the dynamic CO2RR process. Herein, we re&#8208;survey recent studies with the emphasis on revealing the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites under CO2RR conditions extracted by in situ/operando characterizations, and further validate a critical link between the chemical state of Cu and the product profile of CO2RR. This point of view provides a generalizable concept of dynamic chemical&#8208;state&#8208;driven CO2RR selectivity that offers an inspiration in both fundamental understanding and efficient electrocatalysts design.

         <title>Prevent or Cure&#8212;The Unprecedented Need for Self&#8208;Reporting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17290-17313, August 2, 2021. </description>

Are we facing the hard realities imparted by the limitations of self&#8208;healing materials? The answer lies in self&#8208;reporting materials. Prior to any self&#8208;healing processes, potential system changes along damages need to be detected and reported in a visual fashion. This review highlights the mechanisms of self&#8208;reporting materials and the challenges that need to be overcome to enable real&#8208;world applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials, and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, for example, prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self&#8208;healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self&#8208;reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self&#8208;reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self&#8208;reporting systems, the recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self&#8208;reporting fashion.

Near&#8208;infrared enzyme&#8208;activatable fluorescent probes have been considered to be an effective tool for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. This review focuses on the design strategy of enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes, the development of biological applications and new multifunctional probes as well as the direction of clinical transformation.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) activatable fluorescent probes have been considered to be the effective edge tools for the investigation of cell biology and disease diagnosis because of their outstanding advantages. Related genes involved in tumor genesis and progression regulate the overexpression of certain enzymes. Owing to the distinctive characteristics of quick reaction time and favorable pharmacokinetics, enzyme&#8208;reactive NIR optical probes have shown great potential in the diagnosis of tumorigenesis and in image&#8208;guided intraoperative surgeries with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. In this review, we mainly summarize the latest advancements in enzyme&#8208;reactive NIR fluorescent probes from design strategy to biomedical application. Specifically, some challenges and prospects in this field are presented at the end of the review, which will be beneficial to innovatively construct new multifunctional fluorescent probes and actively promote their clinical transformation in the future.

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring porous crystalline structures with coordinated metal nodes and organic linkers, have recently found increasing interest in diverse applications. By virtue of their versatile and highly tunable compositions and structures, constructing hollow architectures will further endow MOFs with enhanced properties and designability, exceeding the molecular scale. MOFs could be considered as promising building units to fabricate complex hollow nanocomposites with faster mass transport, multiple active components, more exposed active sites, and better compatibility than bulk MOFs. To construct a promising blueprint for hollow pristine MOFs, this review provides a comprehensive overview for structural design strategies and applications of hollow pristine MOFs. We will highlight the merits, challenges and future potential by structuring and applying MOFs in sensing, separation, storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, photochemical and electrochemical energy conversion. This review might pave a new avenue for future development of novel pristine hollow MOFs.

         <title>Automated Crystal Structure Determination Has its Pitfalls: Correction to the Crystal Structures of Iodine Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17452-17454, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the previous crystal structure determinations of both modifications of iodine azide half of the X&#8208;ray reflections were missed, resulting in incorrect unit cells, incorrect space groups, and unsatisfactory structural models. Using the old data, but including the missed weak reflections, sensible structures were determined. It pays off to take a skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data and not to rely solely on computer generated models.







Abstract
Previously published crystal structure determinations of two modifications of iodine azide (IN3) are corrected. In the original determinations, the very weak X&#8208;ray reflections with odd k&#8197;Miller indices had been discarded, resulting in too small unit cells and models with misordered, partly occupied atomic positions. Using the original diffraction data, refinements with the correct unit cells yield structures of polymeric (&#8722;I&#8722;N3&#8722;)n chains that are interlocked to layers. A skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data is always recommended to overcome the lack of crystallographic expertise of computers at automated structure determinations.

A novel MOF film (Cu&#8208;THPP) is prepared and used as the active layer to simulate human memory synapses for the first time. It possesses satisfactory fundamental function of biological synaptic memory. This work demonstrates the tremendous application potential of 2D MOF films in artificial synaptic devices.







Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film as the active layer show promising application prospects in various fields including sensors, catalysis, and electronic devices. However, exploring the application of 2D MOF film in the field of artificial synapses has not been implemented yet. In this work, we fabricated a novel 2D MOF film (Cu&#8208;THPP, THPP=5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine), and further used it as an active layer to explore the application in the simulation of human brain synapses. It shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties, and exhibits the foundation function of synapses such as long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), and the conversion of STP to LTP. Most critically, the MOF based artificial synaptic device exhibits an excellent stability in atmosphere. This work opens the door for the application of 2D MOF film in the simulation of human brain synapses.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Ultrasmall Gold Nanoclusters in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17388-17393, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous nucleation approach has been developed to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters by activated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene moieties in a porous solid&#8208;state matrix. The resultant composite exhibits an activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction four times higher than control materials without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization.







Abstract
Ultrafine gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) are susceptible to migrate and aggregate, even in the porosity of many crystalline solids. N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a class of structurally diverse ligands for the stabilization of Au&#8208;NCs in homogeneous chemistry, showing catalytic reactivity in CO2 activation. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a heterogeneous nucleation approach to stabilize ultrasmall and highly dispersed gold nanoclusters in an NHC&#8208;functionalized porous matrix. The sizes of gold nanoclusters are tunable from 1.3&#8197;nm to 1.8&#8197;nm based on the interpenetration of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) topology. Control experiments using amine or imidazolium&#8208;functionalized MOFs afforded the aggregation of Au species. The resultant Au&#8208;NC@MOF composite exhibits a steady and excellent activity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, superior to control mixtures without NHC&#8208;ligand stabilization. Mechanistic studies reveal the synergistic catalytic effect of MOFs and Au&#8208;NCs through the MOF&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au covalent&#8208;bonding bridges.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Decarboxylation Coupling Facilitated by Lock&#8208;to&#8208;Unlock Variation of Molecules upon the Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17435-17439, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of a new macrocyclic compound by on&#8208;surface decarboxylation coupling was developed. This work opens up a promising route for improving the practicality of on&#8208;surface synthesis in cases that involve high energy barriers as well as achieving the structural homogeneity, which are major unresolved challenges in this field.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) involving relatively high energy barriers remains challenging due to a typical dilemma: firm molecular anchor is required to prevent molecular desorption upon the reaction, whereas sufficient lateral mobility is crucial for subsequent coupling and assembly. By locking the molecular precursors on the substrate then unlocking them during the reaction, we present a strategy to address this challenge. High&#8208;yield synthesis based on well&#8208;defined decarboxylation, intermediate transition, and hexamerization is demonstrated, resulting in an extended and ordered network exclusively composed of the newly synthesized macrocyclic compound. Thanks to the steric hindrance of its maleimide group, we attain a preferential selection of the coupling. This work unlocks a promising path to enrich the reaction types and improve the coupling selectivity hence the structual homogeneity of the final product for OSS.

         <title>Helical Microporous Nanorods Assembled by Polyoxometalate Clusters for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17404-17409, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) assembled by polyoxometalate (POM) clusters were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, in an attempt to combine the superior photocatalytic performance of POMs and the unique structure of microporous materials without loading POMs onto other microporous materials. The HMNRs exhibit an outstanding performance in photocatalytic toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Microporous materials are extensively used in catalysis due to their unique pore structures. Among them, microporous materials loaded with polyoxometalates (POMs) exhibit considerable potential for catalysis thanks to the combination of the outstanding redox&#8208;catalytic properties of POMs and the characteristics of microporous materials. Based on this, we developed a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) using POM clusters as building blocks, combining the properties of both POMs and microporous materials while circumventing the complicated loading process. The HMNRs show an enhanced photocatalytic performance for toluene oxidation. Comparatively high activity, superior selectivity towards benzaldehyde, and prominent cycling stability were achieved, manifesting a promising prospect for a future application in photocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) assembled by polyoxometalate (POM) clusters were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, in an attempt to combine the superior photocatalytic performance of POMs and the unique structure of microporous materials without loading POMs onto other microporous materials. The HMNRs exhibit an outstanding performance in photocatalytic toluene oxidation.

By taking advantage of host&#8211;guest molecular recognition at the oil&#8208;water interface, photoresponsive interfacial assemblies with jammed nanoparticle surfactants are present. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the nanoparticle surfactants from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart interfacial systems.







Abstract
The jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interface imparts attractive properties to the interfacial assemblies and enables the structuring of liquids. Herein, we report photoresponsive supramolecular microcapsules with jammed NPS assemblies at the oil&#8208;water interface, taking advantage of host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The permeability of the colloidal membrane can be effectively manipulated by switching the NPSs from a jammed state to an unjammed state with a photo trigger, leading to a controlled molecular diffusion and release, affording a versatile platform for the construction of next generation smart microcapsule systems.

         <title>Tetrazole&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for Efficient C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations</title>

We report the use of isoreticular chemistry to synthesize a tetrazole&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic cage (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol) with the same structure of ZrT&#8208;1 and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;NH2. The adsorption capacity of ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol for C2H2 increases by 130&#8201;% (298&#8197;K) compared with ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;NH2, and it exhibits promising C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation performance.







Abstract
Isoreticular functionalization is a well&#8208;elucidated strategy for pore environment tuning and the basis of gas separation performance in extended frameworks. The extension of this approach to discrete porous molecules such as metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is conceptually straightforward but hindered by synthetic complications, especially stability concerns. We report the successful isoreticular functionalization of a zirconium MOC with tetrazole moiety by bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The title compound (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol) shows promising C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation performance, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, breakthrough experiments, and density functional theory calculations. The design analogy between MOFs and highly stable MOCs may guide the synthesis of novel porous materials for challenging separation applications.

         <title>Be2(BO3)(IO3): The First Anion&#8208;mixed Van der Waals Member in the KBe2BO3F2 Family with a Very Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17415-17418, August 2, 2021. </description>

Be2(BO3)(IO3) is the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal. It is also the first anion&#8208;mixed van der Waals member in the KBe2BO3F2 family with a very strong second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
To obtain new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with a large second harmonic generation (SHG) effect has always been a great challenge. We have synthesized the first metal borate&#8208;iodate NLO crystal, Be2(BO3)(IO3) (BBIO), by multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), in which the structural features of KBBF were maintained and (IO3)&#8722; groups were connected to honeycomb [Be2BO3O2]&#8734; layers. As the first KBBF family member with mixed anionic groups, BBIO benefited from the synergistic effect of (IO3)&#8722;, (BO3)3&#8722; and (BeO4)6&#8722; groups, and exhibited a very strong SHG response of &#8776;7.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP, @1064&#8197;nm) and a large birefringence (&#916;n) of 0.172 at 1064&#8197;nm. BBIO may, unexpectedly, optimize growth habits via van der Waals forces. This study presents borate&#8208;iodate as a new NLO material and it demonstrates opportunities in KBBF structural engineering.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Responsive Gene Delivery from Perfluorocarbon Nanoemulsions through Cleavable Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17362-17367, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disulfide&#8208;linked poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactant allows for stabilization of perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water nanoemulsions. Upon reduction, the surfactant is cleaved, triggering destabilization and subsequent release of the encapsulated payload. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved selectively in high concentrations of reducing agent, allowing for delivery of fluorous&#8208;tagged plasmid DNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein.







Abstract
The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in&#8197;cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.

Reactive but easy to handle: For the first time, rare&#8208;earth metals (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tm, Y, Sc) are obtained as high&#8208;quality nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm in size) in the liquid phase. They can be highly interesting as reactive starting materials to realize new rare&#8208;earth metal compounds and/or phase&#8208;pure rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm)&#8212;ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#8197;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#8197;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal&#8212;is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspensions and powders under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8211;organic compounds at room temperature.

         <title>Reducing Defects Density and Enhancing Hole Extraction for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ Interactions</title>

Featuring a fused tricyclic core, an organic small molecule was intentionally synthesized to reduce defects density and improve hole transportation in perovskite devices via &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, confirmed by multiple characterizations and simulation.







Abstract
Molecular doping is an of significance approach to reduce defects density of perovskite and to improve interfacial charge extraction in perovskite solar cells. Here, we show a new strategy for chemical doping of perovskite via an organic small molecule, which features a fused tricyclic core, showing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions with under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ in perovskite. This &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions could reduce defects density of the perovskite and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. In addition, this doping via &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions could deepen the surface potential and downshift the work function of the doped perovskite film, facilitating the hole extraction to hole transport layer. As a result, the doped device showed high efficiency of 21.41&#8201;% with ignorable hysteresis. This strategy of fused tricyclic core&#8208;based doping provides a new perspective for the design of new organic materials to improve the device performance.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Oxidation Greatly Promoted by Chlorine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17398-17403, August 2, 2021. </description>

A highly efficient CH4 electro&#8208;oxidation system was developed. The electrochemical generation of surface&#8208;adsorbed *Cl intermediates was stabilized by mixed Co&#8211;Ni spinels and allowed to effectively convert CH4 to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, with an outstanding yield of CH3Cl and a high selectivity at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered methane (CH4) conversion at ambient conditions is an attractive but highly challenging field. Due to the highly inert character of CH4, the selective cleavage of its first C&#8722;H bond without over&#8208;oxidation is essential for transforming CH4 into value&#8208;added products. In this work, we developed an efficient and selective CH4 conversion approach at room temperature using intermediate chlorine species (*Cl), which were electrochemically generated and stabilized on mixed cobalt&#8211;nickel spinels with different Co/Ni ratios. The lower overpotentials for *Cl formation enabled an effective activation and conversion of CH4 to CH3Cl without over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, and Ni3+ at the octahedral sites in the mixed cobalt&#8211;nickel spinels allowed to stabilize surface&#8208;bound *Cl species. The CoNi2Ox electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding yield of CH3Cl (364&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and a high CH3Cl/CO2 selectivity of over 400 at room temperature, with demonstrated capability of direct CH4 conversion under seawater working conditions.

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Realize Surface Reconstruction of Small&#8208;Sized Platinum&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17430-17434, August 2, 2021. </description>

A top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy has been proposed for the precise surface reconstruction of Pt&#8208;based nanoparticles. The reconstructed nanoparticles display excellent stability at high temperature, yet serve as highly active and selective catalysts for the hydrogenations of phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
Over the past decades, despite the substantial efforts that have been devoted to the modifications of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to tailor their selectivities for hydrogenation reactions, there are still a lack of facile strategies for precisely regulation of the surface properties of NPs, especially for those with small sizes. In this work, we propose a top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy for tuning the surface properties of Pt&#8208;based NPs (&#8776;4&#8197;nm) without the occurrence of aggregation. Compared to conventional bottom&#8208;up methods, the present top&#8208;down strategy can precisely regulate the surface compositions of Pt&#8208;Cd NPs and other ternary Pt&#8208;Cd&#8208;M NPs (M=Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, and Sn). The optimized Pt&#8208;Cd NPs exhibit excellent selectivity toward phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenations with a styrene selectivity and 4&#8208;aminophenyl styrene selectivity of 95.2&#8201;% and 94.5&#8201;%, respectively. This work provides a general strategy for the surface reconstructions of Pt&#8208;based NPs, and promotes fundamental research on catalyst design for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Shows Modafinil, A Student Study Drug, Changes the Lipid Composition of the Fly Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17378-17382, August 2, 2021. </description>

Modafinil, used for sleep disorder treatment, appears to enhance attention as well as improve learning and memory. Imaging mass spectrometry is used to investigate the effects of modafinil on the alteration of lipid composition on fly brain. Modafinil induces a decrease in PC and SM contents and increases the levels of PEs and PIs. The lipid changes caused by modafinil are similar to the effects of methylphenidate, which also improves cognition.







Abstract
Modafinil, a widely used psychoactive drug, has been shown to exert a positive impact on cognition and is used to treat sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Using time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometric imaging, we studied the changes of brain lipids of Drosophila melanogaster induced by modafinil to gain insight into the functional mechanism of modafinil in the brain. We found that upon modafinil treatment, the abundance of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species in the central brain of Drosophila is significantly decreased, whereas the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol in the brains show significant enhancement compared to the control flies. The alteration of brain lipids caused by modafinil is consistent with previous studies about cognition&#8208;related drugs and offers a plausible mechanism regarding the action of modafinil in the brain as well as a potential target for the treatment of certain disorders.

&lt;p&gt;Modafinil, a widely used psychoactive drug, has been shown to exert a positive impact on cognition and is used to treat sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometric imaging, we studied the changes of brain lipids of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; induced by modafinil to gain insight into the functional mechanism of modafinil in the brain. We found that upon modafinil treatment, the abundance of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species in the central brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is significantly decreased, whereas the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol in the brains show significant enhancement compared to the control flies. The alteration of brain lipids caused by modafinil is consistent with previous studies about cognition-related drugs and offers a plausible mechanism regarding the action of modafinil in the brain as well as a potential target for the treatment of certain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

[o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O exhibits the first example of [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chains and high SHG effect. The asymmetric (o&#8208;C5H4NHOH)+ is in favor of polymerization and inducing the formation of the NCS structure.







Abstract
An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid polyiodate, namely, [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I), featuring a novel branched polyiodate chain has been obtained by evaporation method. [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I) crystalizes in the polar space group Ia and features an [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chain in which [I3O9]3&#8722; trimers are grafted on the same side of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain based on [I4O11(OH)]3&#8722; tetramers. The asymmetric organic amine groups are beneficial to the polymerization of iodate groups and inducing the formation of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure. Compound I exhibits a rather large Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208; Generation (SHG) signal of 8.5&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) upon 1064&#8197;nm laser radiation, a moderate band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a high laser&#8208;induced&#8208;damage&#8208;threshold (LIDT) of 182.34&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, hence it is a promising new SHG material. The relationship between the structures of the organic amine groups and the overall structures has been also analyzed.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Diketone&#8208;Modified Nucleotides and DNA for Cross&#8208;Linking with Arginine&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>

Arginine&#8208;specific 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked reactive nucleotides are reported for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes and cross&#8208;linking with peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Linear or branched 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked thymidine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphate were synthesized through CuAAC click reaction of diketone&#8208;alkynes with 5&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were good substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase in primer extension synthesis of modified DNA. The nucleotide bearing linear 3,5&#8208;dioxohexyl group (HDO) efficiently reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable pyrimidine&#8208;linked conjugates, whereas the branched 2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;butyl (PDO) group was not reactive. Reaction with Lys or a terminal amino group formed enamine adducts that were prone to hydrolysis. This reactive HDO modification in DNA was used for bioconjugations and cross&#8208;linking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.g. histones).

This study reports the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene conjoined bismacrocycle (SCPP[10]). Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176;. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and PCBM was formed and investigated.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed conjoined (1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twisted benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The conjoined structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.

         <title>Unveiling Five Naked Structures of Tartaric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17410-17414, August 2, 2021. </description>

The conformational landscape of the chiral and astrochemical tartaric acid molecule has been revealed for the first time using a combination of laser ablation and rotational spectroscopy techniques. Five different structures have been characterized, being ruled by different hydrogen bonding patterns. Also, this data enables the first attempt to detect this molecule in the interstellar medium.







Abstract
The unbiased, naked structures of tartaric acid, one of the most important organic compounds existing in nature and a candidate to be present in the interstellar medium, has been revealed in this work for the first time. Solid samples of its naturally occurring (R,R) enantiomer have been vaporized by laser ablation, expanded in a supersonic jet, and characterized by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. In the isolation conditions of the jet, we have discovered up to five different structures stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond networks dominated by O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O motifs extended along the entire molecule. These five forms, two with an extended (trans) disposition of the carbon chain and three with a bent (gauche) disposition, can serve as a basis to represent the shape of tartaric acid. This work also reports the first set of spectroscopy data that can be used to detect tartaric acid in the interstellar medium.

Reversible Li plating/stripping at both high current density of 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and areal capacity of 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved by designing an ultra&#8208;thin graphene quantum dot overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li&#8208;metal.







Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;current&#8208;density and high&#8208;area&#8208;capacity operation of Li metal anodes offers promising opportunities for high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation batteries. However, high&#8208;rate Li deposition suffers from undesired Li&#8208;ion depletion especially at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which compromises achievable capacity and lifetime. Here, electronegative graphene quantum dots are synthesized and assembled into an ultra&#8208;thin overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li&#8208;metal to fully relieve Li&#8208;ion depletion. The protected Li anode achieves long&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 1000&#8197;h at both superior current density of 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and areal capacity of 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Implementation of the protected anode allows for the construction of Li&#8208;air full battery with both enhanced rate capability and cycling performance.

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17344-17349, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), neat or surface&#8208;modified with mesogenic motifs, transmit their inherent structural and morphological chirality to an achiral nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) elastic medium with a helical twisting power rivaling the most potent organic chiral dopants. The helical pitch, p, of the induced chiral N*&#8208;LC phase is tightened even when CNCs are decorated with achiral molecules bearing structural resemblance to the N&#8208;LC host.







Abstract
The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Induced Heterogenization of Nickel and Palladium Catalysts for Copolymerization of Ethylene with Polar Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17446-17451, August 2, 2021. </description>

An alternative heterogenization approach that uses hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced interactions of a solid support with metal complexes was developed. The resulting heterogeneous nickel and palladium catalysts showed superior properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with great product morphology control.







Abstract
The practical synthesis of polar&#8208;functionalized polyolefins using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers is a challenge; the use of heterogeneous catalysts is little explored. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterogeneous naphthoquinone&#8208;based nickel (Ni/SiO2) and palladium (Pd/SiO2) catalysts through hydrogen bonding interactions of the ligands with the silica surface. Ni/SiO2 exhibits high activities (up to 2.65&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) during the copolymerization of ethylene with 5&#8208;hexene&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;acetate, affording high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (Mn up to 630&#8201;000) polar&#8208;functionalized semicrystalline polyethylene (comonomer incorporation up to 2.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), along with great morphology control. The resulting copolymers possess improved surface properties and great mechanical properties. Pd/SiO2 can mediate ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers with moderate activity to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight copolymers with tunable comonomer incorporation.

         <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 32, Page 17350-17355, August 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 coupled with finite element simulation, we reveal strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox reaction is sluggish at low SOC, but increases rapidly as SOC increases. The kinetic limitation at low SOC can be alleviated through interaction with polycrystals integrated into the same electrode.







Abstract
High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the ionic transport and kinetic properties. We report here a quantitative assessment of redox reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox is sluggish at low SOC but increases rapidly as SOC increases, both in bulk electrodes and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Fluorinated Allenes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkylation/Defluorination of Propargyl Difluorides with Alkylzincs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of propargyl difluorides R  1  CF  2  C&#8801;CR  2  with alkylzincs R  3  ZnCl giving axially chiral fluorinated allenes R  1  FC=C=CR  2  R  3  with high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) was found to be catalyzed by a chiral diene/rhodium complex. A key step in the catalytic cycle is selective elimination of one of the enantiotopic fluorides at b&#8208;position of an alkenyl&#8211;Rh intermediate which is generated by regioselective addition of R  3  &#8211;Rh onto the triple bond of the starting difluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the major challenges in the sulfur cathode of the Li&#8208;S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling suppressing simultaneously. This issue can be well solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N&#8208;doped carbon hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS&#8208;HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS&#8208;HSs achieve the high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate the charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses the LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double&#8208;shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo2C/C composition renders the HDS&#8208;HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo2C/C/S HDS&#8208;HSs electrode with the high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability in the composed Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Wireframe DNA Cube &#8208; Antibody Conjugate for Targeted Delivery of Multiple Copies of Monomethyl Auristatin E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, several antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been accepted by the FDA as therapeutics against cancer. It is well&#8208;known that control of drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) is vital for the success of an ADC, which inspires the advancement of better and simpler methods for tight control of DAR. We present the development of an antibody DNA wireframe cube conjugate for precise control of DAR. The DNA wireframe cube consists of four single strands, which when folded present eight single stranded domains. One domain is bound to a monofunctionalized antibody DNA conjugate, and the seven others are attached to DNA functionalized with the potent tubulin inhibitor MMAE, thereby preparing an ADC with a DAR of precisely seven. The formation of the ADC is investigated by gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy. Lastly, the developed MMAE loaded ADC was used for targeted drug delivery in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Methane: Recent Advancements and Prospects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abundant and affordable methane is not only high&#8208;quality fossil energy, but also the raw material for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven conversion of methane offers a promising approach to directly transform methane to valuable energy sources under mild conditions, but remains as a grand challenge currently. In this Review, recent advancements of photocatalytic conversion of methane are systematically summarized. Insights into the construction of effective semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts from the perspective of light&#8208;absorption units and active centers are proposed and discussed in detail. Moreover, photocatalytic performances of methane conversion over various catalysts are also presented and classified by oxidant systems. Lastly, challenges and future perspectives concerning mechanistic study and practical application of photocatalytic methane oxidation are introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Brightening up Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Monosubstituted Polyacetylene by Conformation Control: Mechanism, Switching, and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conjugated polymer monosubstituted polyacetylenes (mono&#8208;PAs) have been generally considered to be non&#8208;emissive. Herein we report the first example of luminescent mono&#8208;PAs based on contracted  cis&#8208;cisoid  polyene backbone, displaying an excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance with a high dissymmetric factor (up to the order of 10  &#8208;1  ). The luminescence stems from the helical  cis&#8208;cisoid  PA backbone, which is tightly fixed by the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby reversing the energy order of excited states and enabling an emissive energy dissipation. CPL switches are facilely achieved by the solvent and temperature through reversible conformational transition. By taking advantages of fast response and high sensitivity, the thin film of mono&#8208;PAs could be used as a CPL&#8208;based probe for quantitative detection of trifluoroacetic acid with a wider linear dynamic range than those of photoluminescence and circular dichroism. This work opens a new avenue to develop novel smart CPL materials through modulating conformational transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic study of the aqueous reaction of organic peroxides with HSO3&#8208; on the surface of a water droplet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous reactions between organic peroxides and SO2 are of intense interest in atmospheric science because of their ubiquitous implications for sulfate formation in secondary aerosols. However, the relative yields of the reaction products (inorganic vs organic sulfates) remain controversial (i.e., 90% vs 40&#8208;70% for inorganic sulfate) due in part to the lack of understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, our computational results suggest that the reactions of HSO3&#8208; (dissolved SO2) with organic peroxides are initiated on the surface of water nanodroplets and then proceed under two reaction pathways, in which the S atom of HSO3&#8208; attacks either the O1 or O2 atom of the peroxide group &#8208;O(O2)O(O1)H, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. Notably, we find that the reaction initiated by O1 atom exhibits a relatively low energy barrier and high reaction rate, which favours the formation of inorganic sulfate.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic ORR Activity Enhancement of Pt Atomic Sites by Engineering d&#8208;Band Center via Local Coordination Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A considerable amount of platinum (Pt) is required to ensure an adequate rate for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the contents of Pt. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co&#8208;coordination on carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the  d  &#8208;band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. The PtNPC with a record&#8208;low Pt content (~0.026 wt%) consequently shows a benchmark&#8208;comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 V  RHE  and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V  RHE  . It also features a high stability in 15,000&#8208;cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80 s  &#8208;1  at 0.9 V  RHE  .  Damjanovic  kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from mixed 2/4&#8208;electron to predominate 4&#8208;electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts  d  &#8208;band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.</dc:description>

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Proximity Aptasensing for Cell&#8208;Surface Real&#8208;Time Monitoring Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature,&#160; intact apoptotic cells release ATP as a signaling molecule to trigger the prompt phagocytic clearance, even at the earliest stage of apoptosis. Inspired by it, here we introduce a straightforward strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring the ATP exocytosis and drug&#8208;stimulated apoptosis in the cancer cell surroundings. Triplex&#8208;boosted G&#8208;quadruplexes (tb&#8208;G4s) responding to cell environmental factors (H  +  and K  +  ) are engineered to construct a DNA logic&#8208;gated nanoplatform for proximity ATP aptasensing on cell surface. It enables real&#8208;time monitoring cell apoptosis by capturing released endogenous ATP during chemotherapy drug stimulation, providing a sensitive approach for dynamically evaluating drug&#8208;induced apoptosis and therapeutic efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylamine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new linkages is one of the most efficient strategies to enrich the family of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Particularly, functional linkages can endow COFs with additional tailored properties besides the building units, which thereby further    diversify COFs with desired functions  . Herein, for the first time, we developed a new arylamine linkage for the construction of COFs. Two new arylamine&#8208;linked COFs (AAm&#8208;TPB and AAm&#8208;Py) were prepared by condensing cost&#8208;effective  dimethyl succinyl succinate  (DMSS) with corresponding multitopic amines (TPB&#8208;NH  2  and Py&#8208;NH  2  ).  Due to the abundant electroactive diphenylamine moieties in the COF skeletons  resembling that of polyaniline (PANI), one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive polymer, the pseudocapacitive energy storage performance of AAm&#8208;TPB was further investigated. Remarkably, AAm&#8208;TPB electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 271 F g  &#8722;1  with a three&#8208;electrode setup at a discharge rate of 1 A g  &#8722;1  , which represents one of the highest capacitances among the reported COF&#8208;based electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Photoacoustic Effect via Intramolecular Motions Amplifying Thermal&#8208;to&#8208;Acoustic Conversion Efficiency for Adaptive Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging emerges as a promising technique for biomedical applications. The development of new strategies to boost PA conversion without depressing other properties (e.g., fluorescence) is highly desirable for multifunctional imaging but difficult to realize. Here, we report a new phenomenon that active intramolecular motions could promote PA signal by specifically increasing thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion efficiency. The compound with intense intramolecular motion exhibits amplified PA signal by elevating thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion, and the fluorescence also increases due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission signature. The simultaneously high PA signal and fluorescence brightness of TPA&#8208;TQ3 NPs enable precise image&#8208;guided surgery. The preoperative fluorescence and PA imaging are capable of locating orthotopic breast tumor in a high&#8208;contrast manner, and the intraoperative fluorescence imaging delineates tiny residual tumors. This study highlights a new design guideline of intramolecular motion amplifying PA effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of a reactive [Cu2(&#181;&#8208;OH)2] intermediate in Cu/TEMPO catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu  I  /TEMPO (TEMPO = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;  N  oxyl) catalyst systems are versatile catalysts for aerobic alcohol oxidation reactions to selectively yield aldehydes. However, several aspects of the mechanism are yet unresolved, mainly because of the lack of identification of any reactive intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a dinuclear [Cu  2  L1  2  ]  2+  complex  1  (  L1  = 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;  N  (propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)butan&#8208;2&#8208;amine), which in presence of TEMPO can couple the catalytic 4H  +  /4e  &#8208;  reduction of O  2  to water to the oxidation of benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The mechanisms of the O  2  &#8208;reduction and alcohol oxidation reactions have been clarified on the basis of the spectroscopic detection of the reactive intermediates in the gas and condensed phases, as well as by kinetic studies on each step in the catalytic cycles. Notably, a bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species  3  , which is generally considered as a sluggish oxidant and a product of catalyst decomposition, is shown to be a viable reactant in oxidation catalysis. Furthermore, a bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo)dicopper(III) species  2  is identified as a precursor to  3  . A variety of spectroscopic methods (UV&#8211;vis absorption, infrared (IR), resonance Raman (rRaman) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)) coupled with advanced theoretical calculations has been applied for the unambiguous assignment of the geometric and electronic structures of  2  and  3  . The present study provides deep mechanistic insight into the aerobic oxidation of alcohols that should serve as a valuable foundation for ongoing efforts dedicated towards the understanding of transition metal catalysts involving redox&#8208;active organic cocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorophyll and heme are among the &#8216;pigments of life&#8217;, tetrapyrrolic structures, without which life on Earth would not be possible. Their catabolites, the phyllobilins and the bilins, respectively, share not only structural features, but also a similar story: Long considered waste products of detoxification processes, important bioactivities for both classes have now been demonstrated. For phyllobilins, however, research on physiological roles is sparse. Here, we introduce actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton, as the first discovered target of phyllobilins and as a novel target of bilins. We demonstrate the inhibition of actin dynamics  in vitro  and effects on actin and related processes in cancer cells. A direct interaction with G&#8208;actin is shown by  in silico  studies and confirmed by affinity chromatography. Our findings open a new chapter in bioactivities of tetrapyrroles &#8208; especially phyllobilins &#8208; for which they form the basis for broad implications in plant science, ecology, and physiology.</dc:description>

         <title>HPM&#8208;16, a New Stable Interrupted Zeolite with a Multidimensional Mixed Medium&#8208;Large Pore System Containing Supercages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HPM&#8208;16 is a highly porous germanosilicate zeolite with an interrupted framework that contains a three&#8208;dimensional system of 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10 membered ring (MR) pores. The 10(12) MR pore in the  b  direction is a 10MR pore with long 12MR stretches forming 30 &#197;&#160; long tubular supercages. Along one direction the 10MR pores are fused, meaning that the&#160; separation between adjacent pores consists of a single tetrahedron that is, additionally,&#160;&#160; connected to only three additional tetrahedra (a  Q  3  ). These fused pores are thus decorated&#160; by T&#8208;OH groups along the whole diffusion path, creating a hydrophilic region embedded in an&#160; otherwise essentially hydrophobic environment. The structure is built from highly porous&#160; 12&#215;12&#215;12 MR uninterrupted layers that are connected to each other through  Q  3  producing a&#160; second system of 10&#215;10&#215;10 MR pores. This zeolite can be extensively degermanated&#160; yielding a material with high thermal stability, despite its interrupted nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Ynamides with Aryldichloroboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;carboboration of ynamides is presented. Readily available aryldichloroboranes react with alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted ynamides in high yields with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to valuable &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl/aryl &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted enamides which belong to the class of trisubstituted alkenylboronates. The 1,2&#8208;carboboration reaction is experimentally easy to conduct, shows high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method. The reaction can also be used to access 1&#8208;boraphenalenes, a class of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>A Color&#8208;Shifting Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Aptamer&#8208;Fluorophore Module for Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) have become promising tools for visualizing RNAs in living cells. Specific binding of FLAPs to their non&#8208;fluorescent cognate ligands results in a dramatic fluorescence increase, thereby allowing RNA imaging. Here, we present a color&#8208;shifting aptamer&#8208;fluorophore system, where the free dye is cyan fluorescent and the aptamer&#8208;dye complex is near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent. Unlike other reported FLAPs, this system enables ratiometric RNA imaging. To design the color&#8208;shifting system, we synthesized a series of environmentally sensitive benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin hybrid fluorophores which exist in equilibrium between a cyan fluorescent spirocyclic form and a NIR fluorescent zwitterionic form. As an RNA tag, we evolved a 38&#8208;nucleotide aptamer that selectively binds the zwitterionic forms with nanomolar affinity. We used this system as a light&#8208;up RNA marker to image mRNAs in the NIR region and demonstrated its utility in ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large band gap and strong nonlinear optical (NLO) effect are two valuable but contradictory parameters, which are difficult to balance in one infrared (IR) NLO material. Herein, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal diamond&#8208;like (DL) IR NLO material Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  , presenting a honeycomb&#8208;like 3D framework constructed by 6&#8208;membered LiS  4  rings and GeMgS  6  zigzag chains, was rationally designed and synthesized. The introduction of rigid alkali metal and alkaline&#8208;earth metal LiS  4  and MgS  4  tetrahedra effectively broadens the band gap of DL compound to 4.12 eV (the largest one in the reported quaternary metal chalcogenides), generating a high laser damage threshold of 7 &#215; AgGaS  2  at 1064 nm. Furthermore, Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  displays a suitable SHG response (0.7 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) with a type I phase&#8208;matching behavior. The results indicate that Li  4  MgGe  2  S  7  is a promising IR NLO material for the high&#8208;power laser application and it provides an insight into the design of new DL compound with outstanding IR NLO performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable site&#8208;specific functionalization of DNA origami with polynucleotide brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized origami nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;regulated Electron Transfer and Exchange&#8208;enhanced Reactivity in Fe4S4&#8208;mediated Redox Reaction of the Dph2 Enzyme During the Biosynthesis of Diphthamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8208;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C  (&#947;)  bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy group, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the Pauli principle, the spin arrangements on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the spin of the shifted electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the  exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity  via the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro&#8208; or iodo&#8208; donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma&#8208;hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty&#8208;fold and eight&#8208;fold increase in chloride anion affinity respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (  3&#183;ChB  ), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the Te&#8208;bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine&#8208;tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB&#8208;based receptor systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable production of benzylamines from lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C  &#945;  &#8208;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C  &#946;  &#8208;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and that secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of pseudo&#8208;natural product design and formal natural product ring distortion yields stereochemically and biologically diverse pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally complex and diverse natural products (NPs) display diverse biological activities and inspire the synthesis of new bioactive compound classes. We describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new natural product&#8208;inspired compound class obtained by combination of the conceptually complementary pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) design strategy and a formal adaptation of the complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity ring distortion approach. Fragment&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) whose different scaffolds can formally be viewed as related to each other or are obtained by ring distortion were combined with alkaloid&#8208;derived pyrrolidine fragments by means of highly selective stereocomplementary 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. Cheminformatic analysis and morphological profiling in the cell painting assay revealed that the resulting pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids are both chemically and biologically diverse, and that biological performance distinctly depends on both the structure of the sesquiterpene lactone&#8208;derived scaffolds and the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragment. Biological investigation of the compound collection led to the discovery of a novel chemotype inhibiting Hedgehog&#8208;dependent osteoblast differentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Gene Editing to Reduce Tumor Thermal Tolerance for Mild&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with an undesirable heating damage to normal organs nearby due to its high temperature (&gt;50  o  C) for available tumor ablation. Achieving PTT strategies at a relatively low temperature therefore demonstrates tremendous value to clinic. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4, 4'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of APACPs are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of Hsp90&#945; for reducing thermal&#8208;resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT. This strategy provides a promising method for gene editing targeting tumor microenvironments, and opens a possibility to improve the therapeutic effect and minimize the side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly System for the Construction of a Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a promising avenue to treat and eradicate cancer. However, the significantly different physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and drug molecules hinder the potential direct integration of these two agents into a single particle, limiting the construction of an ideal delivery system to achieve synergistic antitumor effectiveness. Herein, we developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrugs through direct self&#8208;assembly of cyanine&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (Cys&#8208;DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and drug molecules. Therefore, more drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. As a proof of the concept, our study establishes a simple and reproducible two&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid&#8208;based drug formulation, facilitating future development of drug&#8208;delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Tolerant Covalent Organic Framework Electrolyte with Holistically Oriented Channels for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window and high mechanical strength is the key to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;dense solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently attracted considerable interests as promising SSEs mainly due to their highly tunable molecular structures and ideally well&#8208;ordered ion migration channels. Herein, we design and synthesize flexible high&#8208;voltage tolerant COF SSE films with holistically oriented channel structure to enable solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811) for the first time. By rationally introducing lithium&#8208;philic groups and electrochemical stable quinolyl aromatic ring linkage, the as&#8208;prepared COFs demonstrated large bandgap with ultralow HOMO value (&#8211;6.2 eV under vacuum) and the highest oxidative stability up to 5.6 V (versus Li  +  /Li) among all the COF SSEs. Upon convenient mechanical assembly under pre&#8208;heat treatment, the obtained flexible COF SSE thin films showed holistically oriented arrangement along the (001) facet with remarkable ionic conductivity up to 1.5 &#215; 10  &#8211;4  S cm  &#8211;1  at 60 &#176;C, and excellent mechanical strength with a high Young&#8217;s modulus of 10.5 GPa. The lithium ions transmission in this COF SSE was revealed to exhibit directional hopping paths and fast drift velocity by molecular dynamic simulations. With such multiple features, we employed this COF SSE film to assemble all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries with NMC811 cathode, which demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400 cycles, high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%) and could also withstand abuse test such as folding.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The plating of lithium on a graphite anode is the main barrier to fast charging of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in addition to causing serious capacity fade and safety issues. Here, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) electrochemical spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Our results indicate that classical &#8216;over&#8208;charging&#8217; (normally associated with potentials &#8804; 0 V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04 V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate lowered to 0.04 mV s&#8208;1. The inhibition of Li deposition by the vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, which is attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer, with higher ionic conductivity. Finally a safe cut&#8208;off potential limit of +0.05 V for the graphite anode is suggested for high rate cycling, which is confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.</dc:description>
