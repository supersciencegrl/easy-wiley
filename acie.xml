         <title>Chlorinated Bithiophene Imide&#8208;based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8208;Property Correlations, and Applications in Organic Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes with optimized geometries and electronic properties is imperative for advancing n&#8208;type polymers and organic electronic devices. We report here the design and synthesis of two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, namely chlorine&#8208;substituted bithiophene imide (ClBTI) and its fused dimer (ClBTI2). The corresponding polymers show near&#8208;planar framework, appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels, and good solubility. When integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors, ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer afforded unipolar electron mobility of up to 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Continuous interpenetrating networks with large fibrillar structures can be formed by introducing these polymers with ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility as the third component. Investigations of charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analyses unveiled that ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer P(ClBTI2&#8208;BTI) enables optimized charge transport, reduced charge recombination, and minimized non&#8208;radiative loss within the all&#8208;polymer blends, yielding a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.35% (certified: 19.20%). The structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships provide valuable insights into the design of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes and n&#8208;type polymers, making a great progress in the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrogenation Reaction via Facet Engineering for Efficient Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia in Actual Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the competitive relationship between nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the conventional approach to improve Faradaic efficiency is to select a catalyst without HER activity. Nevertheless, such strategy not only limits the application of HER catalysts in NO3&#8208;RR, but also causes insufficient hydrogen source, thereby sacrificing ammonia yield rate. We believe that HER catalysts should not be excluded from hydrogenation reduction, and HER&#8208;involvement in NO3&#8208;RR can achieve both high Faradaic efficiency and ammonia yield rate. Herein, taking traditional water electrolysis material Co3O4 as model system, we employ facet engineering and obtain a Faradaic efficiency of 97.51% and an ammonia yield rate of 4.33 mg&#8208;N&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 . Excellent performance is attributed to the oxygen vacancy on crystal facet, which greatly promote water dissociation and capture HER intermediate for NO3&#8208;RR, successfully shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to nitrate hydrogenation. Beyond material development, we construct a hybrid reactor to address and achieve an ammonia recovery rate of 1216.8 g&#8208;N&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;d&#8208;1 in nuclear industry wastewater with ultra&#8208;high nitrate concentration. This study breaks through the limitation of HER catalyst in NO3&#8208;RR, which provides a significant insight into the catalyst designing and hydrogenation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Anodic Decomposition Pathway of Supramolecular Lithium Borate for Rationally Tuned Interphase Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational tailoring and molecular&#8208;level engineering of stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) are paramount to advancing the performance of next&#8208;generation high energy, layered nickel&#8208;rich oxide based lithium metal batteries. However, developing well&#8208;tailored electrolyte additives with rationally controlled interfacial chemistry remains highly challenging. Here, we designed and synthesized two lithium borates: lithium (2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)trifluoroborate (C&#8208;LiMCFB) and lithium (15&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,5,8,11,14&#8208;pentaoxahexadecan)trifluoroborate (L&#8208;LiMCFB), incorporating cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) and linear pentaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGME) as respective host groups tethered to the boron center. In C&#8208;LiMCFB, the supramolecular polydentate chelation/de&#8208;chelation of the 15C5 with Li+ could sequentially deactivate/activate the anodic decomposition of the C&#8208;O bonds, therefore leading to the controlled cleavage pathway of B&#8208;O and C&#8208;O bonds. The controlled interfacial chemistry leads to the formation of a uniform CEI layer, rich in lithium boron&#8208;oxygen clusters interwoven with LiF, on the NCM811 surface. This novel CEI configuration demonstrates an exceptional balance of mechanical robustness, adhesiveness, and toughness, providing highly desirable protection for the NCM811 cathode. The discovery of these novel supramolecular boron&#8208;based lithium salts not only unlocks supramolecular chemistry for rational electrolyte tuning but also provides a deeper understanding of the CEI formation mechanism in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into C&#8722;C Bonds of Benzocyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first insertion of arynes into non&#8208;enolizable ketones is demonstrated in this ortho&#8208;phenylene ring expansion of benzocyclobutenones using 2&#8208;haloaryl boronates as the coupling partner. In this transformation, Pd plays a dual role in both aryne formation and C&#8722;C activation.







Abstract
Insertion of arynes into cyclic C&#8722;C bonds provides a straightforward approach for ring expansion with an ortho&#8208;phenylene moiety; however, the current scope of substrates has been restricted to enolizable ketones. Here we report the first example of aryne&#8208;insertion into non&#8208;enolizable ketones through Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond activation of benzocyclobutenones. 2&#8208;Haloaryl boronates were employed as an unconventional aryne precursor. The reaction shows a wide substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. The mechanistic studies reveal an interesting dual role of the Pd catalyst for both aryne generation and C&#8722;C bond activation.

         <title>High&#8208;Connectivity 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with pdp Net for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel high&#8208;connectivity 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages and exhibit outstanding C2H2/CO2 separation capabilities.







Abstract
High&#8208;connectivity 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention due to their structural complexity, stability, and potential for functional applications. However, the synthesis of 3D COFs using mixed high&#8208;nodal building units remains a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce two novel 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, which are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages (~3.9&#8197;nm). Remarkably, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662 exhibit outstanding separation capabilities, achieving adsorption selectivities of 4.3 and 5.9, respectively, for C2H2/CO2 (1/1, v/v) mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm their excellent separation capability, maintaining this performance even under conditions of 100&#8201;% humidity. Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations indicate that the exceptional adsorption performance is attributed to the well&#8208;defined pore cavities of the COFs, with fluorination of the building unit further enhancing C2H2 selectivity through improved electrostatic and host&#8211;guest interactions. This study expands the structural diversity of COFs and highlights their potential for low&#8208;energy separation processes.

Remarkably, JUC-661 and JUC-662 exhibit outstanding separation capabilities, achieving adsorption selectivities of 4.3 and 5.9, respectively, for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1/1, v/v) mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm their excellent separation capability, maintaining this performance even under conditions of 100&#8201;% humidity. Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations indicate that the exceptional adsorption performance is attributed to the well-defined pore cavities of the COFs, with fluorination of the building unit further enhancing C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity through improved electrostatic and host&#8211;guest interactions. This study expands the structural diversity of COFs and highlights their potential for low-energy separation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Substituent&#8208;Effect in NHCP&#8208;Plumbylenes with a Phosphaplumbene Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aryl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes is achieved through metathesis reactions. Based on computational studies, the substituent effect and the potential double bond character in these species are discussed. A formal [2+2] cycloaddition at a P&#8722;Pb bond demonstrates the synthetic equivalence to double bonds.







Abstract
This work explores the use of plumbylene&#8208;phosphinidenes to address the challenge of isolating P=Pb bonds. Herein, we report the synthesis of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene phosphinidene (NHCP) substituted chlorotetrylene dimers [(IDipp)PECl]2 (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; IDipp=C([N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)CH]2)). Substituent attachment via salt metathesis (E=Sn, Pb) enables the isolation of NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene (IDipp)PSn(SiTms2SiTol3) as well as NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208; and NHCP&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted plumbylenes (IDipp)PPb(SiTms2SiTol3) and (IDipp)PPb(mTer) (mTer=2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Tms=Trimethylsilyl). Access to these structures not only expands this chemistry to the heaviest of group 14 elements but also provides a deeper understanding of the substituent effect on NHCP&#8208;tetrylene bonding. Computational studies demonstrate that both silyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted species exhibit partial multiple bond character, with the silyl&#8208;substituted species showing higher bond orders and reduced polarization. This is further supported by the short P&#8722;E bond lengths observed in their solid&#8208;state structures. Finally, the formal [2+2] cycloaddition of diphenylketene to (IDipp)PPb(mTer) provides experimental evidence for the ability of NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes to serve as synthetic equivalents of P=Pb double bonds.

         <title>Maximizing the Accessibility of Acid Sites Within Zeolite Catalysts for Syngas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the effective diffusion length into the relationship between the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factors of reaction rates, a 12MR channel length of 60&#8197;nm is identified to approach the threshold length for full access to the 8MR acid sites of MOR zeolite in direct syngas conversion. Consequently, MOR60 exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Mass transport within zeolites is pivotal in determining the accessibility of active sites to reactants and hence the catalytic performance. However, there lacks of quantitative guidance for synthesis of desired zeolites with reduced diffusion limitation. Herein, we take mordenite (MOR) zeolite as a model, which is characterized by 12&#8208;membered rings (MR) channels as transport path towards the active sites within the 8MR side pockets for syngas conversion to light olefins. By correlating the effective diffusion lengths (

) with the Thiele modulus and the effectiveness factors of reaction rates over a composite catalyst ZnAlOx&#8208;MOR, we determine that the shortest 12MR channel length (

2L

 ${2L}$



) of 60&#8197;nm in this study is close to the threshold length necessary for full access to the 8MR acid sites. As a result, it exhibits excellent catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%. Furthermore, the methodology is general and essential for further development of efficient zeolite catalysts with fully accessible active sites.

         <title>Abstraction of Hydride from Alkanes and Dihydrogen by the Perfluorotrityl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of a perfluorotrityl cation (F15Tr+) as a salt with halogenated carborane anions. These salts are stable at ambient temperature in the solid state. As predicted by theoretical calculations, F15Tr+ displays remarkable propensity for abstraction of a hydride. It extracts a hydride rapidly from alkanes and slowly even from dihydrogen.







Abstract
Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient&#8208;temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C6F5)3C+ or F15Tr+) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F15Tr+ cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8722;CH2&#8722;groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated TEMPO&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photo&#8208;Induced Hydrogen Peroxide Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitroxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) was synthesized using a one&#8208;pot strategy for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The involvement of the TEMPO active site accelerates photogenerated charge separation. It promotes O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway, resulting in an H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a water&#8208;benzyl alcohol system.







Abstract
Molecular engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offers an alternative approach to conventional anthraquinone oxidation via photo&#8208;induced H2O2 production from O2 reduction. Despite their potential, reported photocatalysts suffer limited proton mobility, low selectivity, and insufficient charge separation and utilization. Herein, we report a nitroxyl radical (TEMPO) decorated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;COF photocatalyst via a one&#8208;pot strategy. Under visible light irradiation, highly crystalline TAPP&#8208;TPDA&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;COF (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in two&#8208;phase water&#8208;benzyl alcohol (10&#8201;% BA) system through direct two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) pathway. The mechanistic study by DFT calculations and in situ DRIFT spectra suggests Yeager&#8208;type adsorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate on the nitroxyl radical site (N&#8722;O&#8901;). The efficient photocatalytic performance and stability of TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF are attributed to the involvement of the nitroxyl radical, which enhances selective O2 adsorption, establishes a distinct electron density distribution, and facilitates photogenerated charge separation compared to TT&#8208;HT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF counterparts. This study uncovers a new perspective for constructing metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;mediated radical&#8208;based COFs for sustainable energy conversion, storage, and biomedical applications.

The efficient photocatalytic performance and stability of &lt;b&gt;TT-T-COF&lt;/b&gt; are attributed to the involvement of the nitroxyl radical, which enhances selective O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, establishes a distinct electron density distribution, and facilitates photogenerated charge separation compared to TT-HT-COF and TT-COF counterparts. This study uncovers a new perspective for constructing metal-free, redox-mediated radical-based COFs for sustainable energy conversion, storage, and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Covalent and Cell&#8208;Active ALKBH5 Inhibitors with Potent Antileukemia Effects In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors. Compound 18&#8201;l exhibited good ALKBH5 inhibitory activity, and excellent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l also had intracellular targeting at the proteomic level.







Abstract
The N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase ALKBH5 is the only other identified m6A eraser except for FTO, and dysregulated ALKBH5 functions were closely associated with leukemogenesis. However, the development of ALKBH5 inhibitors is slow compared to FTO inhibitors. Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as potent and covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors in this work. The analog 18&#8201;l exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on ALKBH5 (IC50=0.62&#8197;&#956;M), and exerted a strong antiproliferative effect on NB4 cells with IC50 of 0.63&#8197;&#956;M. The Kd value of 18&#8201;l binding to ALKBH5 was 804&#8197;nM, while no binding was observed with FTO. This result indicated that 18&#8201;l was a highly selective inhibitor of ALKBH5 rather than FTO. Additionally, proteomic experiments showed that 18&#8201;l directly targeted ALKBH5 in cells and altered m6A levels on mRNA, blocked the related downstream signal pathways, promoted differentiation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l exerted excellent in vivo antitumor activity with TGITV values of 66.3&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mg/kg in NB4 tumor xenograft models.

         <title>Superhelical Self&#8208;Assembly of Microcrystals from Cyclodipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclodipeptide platform delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner. Here we present a cyclodipeptide platform which delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in situ reaction&#8208;induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra&#8208;high yields and phase purity. The pathway comprises formation of subunit microcrystals and the subsequent assembly through adhesion of favorable planes. The cyclodipeptide adopts a folded geometry that generates 2D hydrogen bonded networks differing from the typical 1D duplex hydrogen bonding of diketopiperazines skeletons. The assembly of subunit crystals driven by the hydrogen bonding undergoes dislocations mediated by the inherent chirality of cyclodipeptides. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Dominant Face&#8208;On Oriented Perylene&#8208;Diimide Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry has been used to synthesize a non&#8208;ionic cathode interlayer (PDIBr&#8208;TOT). The dominant face&#8208;on orientation arising from the bulky and extended side chains affords a solar cell efficiency of 19.52&#8201;%, out&#8208;performing typical self&#8208;doping interlayers. Furthermore, the weak electron&#8208;donating side chains in the PDIBr&#8208;TOT interlayers remarkably enhance the device stability.







Abstract
Electron transport properties of cathode interlayers are crucial to high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face&#8208;on molecular orientation of non&#8208;ionic perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208; (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n&#8208;doping effects. 1&#8208;(2,5,8&#8208;trioxadec&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated&#8208;PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr&#8208;TOT. TOT side chains impart PDI&#8208;based interlayers with a dominant face&#8208;on orientation, meanwhile leading to a negligible doping effect due to their weak electron&#8208;donating properties. Impressively, at a slight doping level, higher electron mobility is gained through efficient vertical charge transport channels built by preferred face&#8208;on molecular orientations of PDIBr&#8208;TOT, beating the results acquired through strong doping effects of traditional PDIBr&#8722;N with an edge&#8208;on orientation. Thus, PDIBr&#8208;TOT can suppress exciton recombination and lower the surface energies for good contact with active layers, consequently leading to increases in fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current. Integrating PDIBr&#8208;TOT with various active layers, a remarkable efficiency of 19.52&#8201;% is obtained. Moreover, device stability is enhanced by restrained doping effects. Modulating face&#8208;on orientations of cathode interlayers prescribed here will encourage further innovative designs of high&#8208;performance cathode interlayers towards OSC advances.

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiS&#8208;induced free&#8208;electron reversal migration discharges dz2&#8208;orbital electrons of Au cocatalysts to reduce the antibonding occupancy of Au&#948;+&#8208;Oad bonds, thus improving O2 adsorption and stabilizing *OOH intermediates on NiS@Au cocatalysts to achieve highly selective H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82&#8197;&#956;mol/h/50&#8197;mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07&#8201;% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo&#8208;isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release performance using these light&#8208;responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.







Abstract
Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8211;270&#8197;nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8211;2.14&#8197;nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7&#8197;times greater than that of electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.

         <title>Light&#8208;intersecting Photoclick Reactions for Bioorthogonal Labeling on Single Cells: Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide as a Photoswitchable Reporter</title>

Harnessing T&#8208;type photoswitching (&#955;1) of dibenzothiadiazepine&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), a dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting&#8208;controlled photoclick system is established, synchronizing with photolysis of sydnone (&#955;2) to enable cycloaddition. The photoswitching of DBTDD is pivotal in enabling bioorthogonal decoration of phospholipids on live cell membranes, increasing efficacy in line with elevated 445&#8197;nm laser power density with subcellular spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The advancement of ring&#8208;strain preloaded dipolaro&#8208;/dienophiles plays a crucial role in bioorthogonal chemistry, enabling multiple high&#8208;precision conjugations toward biomolecules simultaneously. However, durability of these ring&#8208;strain preloaded reagents in vivo is a concern, as the ring&#8208;strain is not reloadable once released during delivery process. In situ conversion of light&#8208;energy into ring&#8208;strain is a promising approach to ensure both biostability and spatiotemporal control endowed by light. Herein, we advance a seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzene photoswitch, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), bridged by a sulphone moiety. The photoisomerization from Z&#8208;DBTDD to ring&#8208;strain&#8208;loaded E&#8208;DBTDD enables an accelerated cycloaddition with various photogenerated dipoles to establish novel photoclick reactions, featuring a dual&#8208;&#955; (405&#8197;nm+445&#8197;nm) synergistic control. In reactions with monoarylsydnones, a higher photo&#8208;stationary ratio of E&#8208;DBTDD, achieved by varying the power density of 445&#8197;nm laser, presented an ultrafast cycloaddition rate (kE=6.6&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with a 13.8&#8208;fold acceleration compared with Z&#8208;DBTDD, which is superior to established ring&#8208;strain reporters (e.g., BCN&#8208;OH, sTCO&#8208;OH, DBTD). Then, bioorthogonal photoclick labeling of DBTDD tagged artificial phospholipid on living cell membranes was realized at subcellular resolution via an essential dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting lithography with an elevated efficiency by adjusting the 445&#8197;nm power density.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene with High Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH), achieving an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at &#8722;0.62&#8197;V vs. RHE, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Zinc doping significantly promotes acetylene adsorption and activation, accelerates reaction kinetics, and effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and over&#8208;hydrogenation, offering a highly efficient strategy for sustainable ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) provides a petroleum&#8208;independent strategy for ethylene production. However, the challenges of high overpotentials and strong hydrogen evolution competition reaction over conventional electrocatalysts at industrial current densities result in substantial energy consumption, limiting the practical application of EASH technology. Herein, zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts are designed and prepared via a facile impregnation and electroreduction relay method. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;2.7Zn catalyst exhibits an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% and a reaction potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the previously reported electrocatalysts. The combined results of experimental tests and theoretical calculations demonstrate zinc doping significantly enhances acetylene adsorption and accelerates reaction kinetics, leading to a notable decrease in overpotential. Furthermore, the increased *H&#8208;*H binding energy barrier and the improved ethylene desorption on Cu&#8208;2.7Zn effectively suppress hydrogen evolution and acetylene over&#8208;hydrogenation, contributing to the enhancement of ethylene Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin is introduced to simultaneously boost the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Advanced characterization techniques have revealed that coumarin preserves the mechanical properties of the PEO framework, provides new Li+ hopping centers and constructs a Li2O&#8208;rich SEI layer with excellent Li+ transport dynamics, which are crucial for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO's crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis offers a powerful and sustainable alternative to conventional chemical manufacturing techniques. The direct and selective electrohydrogenation of olefins has enormous potential applicability; however, this reactivity has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Herein, we show that an efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 can promote such transformations. This approach enables olefins to be electrohydrogenated (often below &#8722;3.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) at high current density (JGeo up to 133 mA/cm2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility, requires low catalyst loading, and affords a diverse series of valuable molecules (more than 70 examples) with high chemoselectivity. In addition, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r. &gt; 19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine.</dc:description>

         <title>Digital&#8208;Twin&#8208;Assisted Insights into Irreversible Capacity and Activation Strategy Power High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs), the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current&#8208;collector as that in the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando transport of charge &amp; mass. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on assumed or simplified models. Herein, we build digital&#8208;twin electrodes with digital&#8208;space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital&#8208;model&#8208;driven simulation, we find an interesting &#8220;lithium trapping&#8221; effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes but not near current&#8208;collector region. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Anti&#8208;site Defects in FeWN2 Nanosheets for Enol Electrooxidation Coupled with H2 Evolution at a Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from biomass electrooxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electrooxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#8208;H and O&#8208;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant anti&#8208;site defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8208;2 at 0.69 V (vs. RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.12 V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60&#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as a Primer in a Dual&#8208;Layer Coating for Corrosion Protection on Iron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly&#8208;stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, we demonstrate that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively prevented corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#177;0.2%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Switching Between Nonlinear&#8208;Optical&#8208;Active Nitrate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored syntheses of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, particularly those of metastable NCS polymorphs, remain extremely challenging due to the complex interactions of their constituent primitives. We report herein the first successful synthesis of a set of three nitrate supramolecular polymorphs (C2H5N4)(NO3) (&#945;&#8209;, &#946;&#8209;, and &#947;&#8208;phases) by a pH&#8208;modulation secondary&#8208;bond strategy, via&#160;the assembly of&#160;two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar primitives. Solutions of different pH result in differing orientation of secondary bonds between [C2H5N4] and [NO3] primitives. Secondary bonds dominate the packing of primitives in crystal lattices; varying these secondary bonds can afford NCS or centrosymmetric nitrate supramolecular polymorphs, with 2D &#945;&#8209;phase irreversibly transformed to 2D &#946;&#8209;phase in a solution of appropriate pH. These two polymorphs display distinctly different SHG responses and birefringences, ascribed to variation in stacking of 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded layers resulting from the differing environmental pH. Supramolecular crystal structures comparison and theoretical studies confirm the crucial role played by secondary&#8208;bond interactions between adjacent primitives in the rare nitrate supramolecular polymorphs. This work paves the way in elucidating the supramolecular polymorph transition&#8208;mechanisms and correlating the polymorph structures and their NLO properties, and thereby discloses a new paradigm for development of high&#8208;performance NCS materials with tailored optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt; 90%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7 days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7 days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35 days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and treating distinct diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8208;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via the Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote meta&#8208;selective C&#8208;H functionalizations of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8208;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta&#8208;positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8208;norbornyl&#8208;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>A Magnetic Field&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics by Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn2+ ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr3 (Mn&#8208;CsPbBr3) perovskite, a magnetic field&#8208;responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn2+ ions drives charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr3, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. Increased spin&#8208;polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40 V was obtained for Li&#8208;O2 batteries with Mn&#8208;CsPbBr3 cathodes which demonstrate an ultralow overpotential of 0.12 V and an ultra&#8208;high energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8208;O2 battery system and provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8208;O2 battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Retarding Phase Segregation via Lattice Reinforcement for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Organic Tandem solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operational perovskite/organic tandem solar cells&#160;are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single&#8208;junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA+) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA+ with a larger ionic radius entering the A&#8208;site of lattice tilts the [PbX6]4&#8208; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#8211;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high&#8208;power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting values, delivering a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.34 V. Notably, 0.062&#8208;cm2 and 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandem solar cells&#160;achieved remarkable efficiencies of 26.15% (certified of 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, exhibiting excellent operational stability of T90 ~ 1350 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonmetallic High&#8208;Entropy Engineered Nanocarbons for Advanced ORR Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co&#8208;doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in&#8208;situ polymerization modification of ZIF&#8208;8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a non&#8208;metal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all&#8208;site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O2 species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co&#8208;doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8208;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2 and demonstrating long&#8208;term stability over a 16&#8208;day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high&#8208;entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Superprotonic Conduction over Wide Humidity Range Driven by Enhanced Proton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conducting materials play a key role in various fields, and their proton conduction is profoundly restricted by the proton dissociation process. This process has two components: dissociation from acidic groups (e.g. &#8208;SO3H) and dissociation from intermediate species (e.g. H3O+, C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H+). Extensive research has concentrated on the former, utilizing acidic groups with minimal proton dissociation energy or low pKa values, while the latter's substantial effects have been largely overlooked. In reality, proton&#8208;accepting atoms within intermediates, such as oxygen and nitrogen, typically produce a higher electron cloud density compared to those in acidic groups. This results in a pronounced electrostatic binding effect on mobile protons, as well as high dissociation energies. Thus, diminishing the dissociation energy associated with intermediates is paramount in the development of high&#8208;performance proton conductors. Herein, we construct one covalent organic framework based proton conductor, achieving superprotonic conduction over wide humidity range by decreasing the dissociation energy of protons from intermediates. The success of this approach can be attributed to two key factors: the crowded guest molecules within the framework that mitigate proton hydration, and the concurrent establishment of C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H+ interactions. These combined effects significantly reduce the electrostatic attraction exerted on mobile protons, thereby enhancing proton conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Grain High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Visible&#8208;Spectrum White Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission phosphors are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), overcoming the complex and high costs of traditional mixed phosphors. However, their practical application is hindered by low luminescence efficiency. In this regard, we develop a generalization strategy that involves creating heterostructure interfaces to prevent the detrimental energy transfer process, thereby boosting efficiency. The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (~93.9), a low correlated color temperature (~3100 K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;grain phosphor is an excellent candidate for healthy full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum phosphors technology and inspire the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Arrangement of Ordered D&#8208;A Components in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arrangement of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) components in order at a molecular level provides a means to achieve efficient electron&#8208;hole separation for promoting the activity of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the coordination assembly of D&#8208;A molecules with desired staggered energy levels in two isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) 1 and 2, which exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without using any cocatalysts and photosensitizers. The modulation of active metal sites of the D&#8208;A MOFs leads to an increase of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates from 1260 to 3218 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the energy bond defined by the D&#8208;A components assisted with metal centers is the key to efficiently generate photogenerated charge carriers, and 2 has an appropriate affinity to proton to reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. Besides, the enhanced proton transport kinetics based on the arrayed free carboxyl groups in the hydrogen bonded network endows 2 higher proton conductivity than 1, thus promoting the usage rate of active metal sites in 2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Solvent Effects for Enhanced Oxidation and Coordination in Selective Piezocatalytic Gold Recovery from End&#8208;of&#8208;life Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient gold (Au) recovery from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) under environmentally sustainable and mild conditions presents a significant challenge in resource recycling. This study introduced a novel piezocatalytic method for Au recovery from E&#8208;waste using a mixed acetonitrile&#8208;water (CH3CN&#8208;H2O) solution. The findings emphasize the crucial role of solvent effects in modulating catalytic performance, with a 75% CH3CN solution offering the most efficient recovery. The solvent not only influenced the oxidation and coordination steps crucial for Au extraction but also facilitated electron and mass transfer, accelerating the generation of reactive species that promote Au dissolution. Furthermore, water amplified the effect of the solvent by modifying the chemical potential of surface species, thus optimizing catalytic reactivity. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezocatalytic system achieved 100% Au recovery from various types of E&#8208;waste, exhibiting excellent adaptability across a broad pH range. Large&#8208;scale experiments at the kilogram level confirmed its practicality, with 100% recovery from printed circuit boards and 98% from central processing unit boards. This study underscores the importance of solvent effects in piezocatalysis and provides new insights into the sustainable recovery of precious metals, thereby paving the way for the design of solvent&#8208;assisted catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Two Mechanistically Distinct Reactions from a Single Iron Complex: a Tandem Approach to Thermally Stable and Recyclable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Albumin Drugs&#8208;Cored Spherical Nucleic Acid (ad&#8208;SNA) Platform for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albumin&#8208;based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA&#8208;approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy.&#160;However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor&#8208;targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications.&#160;Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs&#8208;cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency,&#160;superior tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities,&#160;and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we delivered NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor&#8208;specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR&#8208;II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures. In addition, the adSNAs are straightforward to synthesize and scalable for large&#8208;scale production, offering significant potential to advance the development of clinical targeted drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Throughput Microarrays of Peptidoglycan Fragments as a Novel Sero&#8208;Diagnostic Tool for Patient Antibody Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel on&#8208;chip synthesis technology, microarrays of peptidoglycan fragments were generated comprising 864 variants derived from Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. These were used to map monoclonal antibody specificity and to screen samples from patients with the autoimmune disease epidermolysis bullosa, revealing distinct antibody responses. This highlights the platform's potential for profiling microbiome&#8208;associated diseases.







Abstract
Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a complex biopolymer crucial for cell wall integrity and function of all bacterial species. While the strong inflammatory properties of PGN and its derived muropeptides are well&#8208;documented in human innate immune responses, adaptive immunity, including antibody responses to PGN, remain inadequately characterized. Microarray technology represents a cost&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient method for studying such interactions. Our laser&#8208;based technology enables the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of biomolecules on functionalized glass slides. Here, this on&#8208;chip synthesis was developed for PGN fragments, to generate a variety of 216 stem peptides and attach six different glycan moieties that are major structural components of bacterial cell walls. Thereby, 864 PGN fragments from different Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive species were generated. The arrays were validated with four different monoclonal antibodies against PGN or poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine and identified their epitopes. Finally, proof of concept for antibody profiling in patient samples was performed by comparing a panel of well&#8208;characterized plasma samples of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients suffering from (chronic) wounds with Staphylococcus aureus infection. EB patients show an increased response to the muramyl dipeptide. Therefore, this novel high&#8208;throughput PGN glycopeptide microarray technology promises to identify distinct antibody profiles against human microbiomes in diseases, notably in those involving the intestine.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Marine Diterpenoids Caucanolide E and F by Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation: Rigorous Reassignment of Two Almost Indistinguishable Diastereomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of gem&#8208;hydrogenation, which exploits the electrophilic character of the ruthenium carbene intermediates transiently formed, to natural product total synthesis allowed the stereostructure of a pair of diastereomeric seco&#8208;cembranoids that are almost indistinguishable by NMR to be rigorously assigned. Computational analysis of the data by the CP probabilistic method provided independent confirmation.







Abstract
As the spectra of the diastereomeric marine seco&#8208;cembranoids caucanolide E and F are almost identical, the isolation team had not been able to firmly assign their stereostructure. The puzzle has now been solved by a synthetic approach predicated on biogenetic considerations, which suggested that both natural products are 10S configured but differ in the configuration of their C8 stereocenter. Under this proviso, they can be distinguished by comparison with synthetic samples that are deliberately 8S,10S and 8S,10R configured: only one natural product can match sign and magnitude of the [&#945;]D of one of these reference compounds; this particular caucanolide must be the 8S,10S isomer. Both reference compounds needed for this benchmarking exercise were accessible from a single precursor via ruthenium catalyzed gem&#8208;hydrogenation of an enyne to furnish an alkoxyfuran in the first place, followed by hydrolysis; this key transformation leverages the electrophilic character of the pianostool ruthenium carbene intermediates passed through. The recorded data showed that the assignment proposed in the literature is incorrect and needs to be reversed; this conclusion was independently confirmed by a combined NMR/DFT approach using a CP3 probability analysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the spectra of the diastereomeric marine &lt;i&gt;seco&lt;/i&gt;-cembranoids caucanolide E and F are almost identical, the isolation team had not been able to firmly assign their stereostructure. The puzzle has now been solved by a synthetic approach predicated on biogenetic considerations, which suggested that both natural products are 10&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; configured but differ in the configuration of their C8 stereocenter. Under this proviso, they can be distinguished by comparison with synthetic samples that are deliberately 8&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; and 8&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; configured: only one natural product can match sign and magnitude of the [&#945;]&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of one of these reference compounds; this particular caucanolide must be the 8&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; isomer. Both reference compounds needed for this benchmarking exercise were accessible from a single precursor via ruthenium catalyzed &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-hydrogenation of an enyne to furnish an alkoxyfuran in the first place, followed by hydrolysis; this key transformation leverages the electrophilic character of the pianostool ruthenium carbene intermediates passed through. The recorded data showed that the assignment proposed in the literature is incorrect and needs to be reversed; this conclusion was independently confirmed by a combined NMR/DFT approach using a CP3 probability analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity and Magnetic Coupling of Triangulene Dimers Linked via para&#8208;Biphenyl Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangulene dimers linked by one or two para&#8208;biphenyl units were synthesized on Au(111). STM, non&#8208;contact AFM, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet magnetic exchange coupling for Dimer 1 (ES&#8208;T=15&#8197;mV), influenced by the dihedral angles of the two para&#8208;biphenyl units. Dimers 2&#8242; with an ES&#8208;T=6.6&#8197;mV were obtained from a more flexible precursor equipped with one para&#8208;biphenyl linker.







Abstract
Triangulene and its homologues are promising building blocks for high&#8208;spin low&#8208;dimensional networks with long&#8208;range magnetic order. Despite the recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of coupled triangulenes, key parameters such as the number of organic linking units or their dihedral angles remain scarce, making further studies crucial for an essential understanding of their implications. Here, we investigate the synthesis and reactivity of two triangulene dimers linked by two (Dimer 1) or one (Dimer 2) para&#8208;biphenyl units, respectively, on a metal surface in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum environment. First&#8208;principles calculations and model Hamiltonians reveal how spin excitation and radical character depend on the rotation of the para&#8208;biphenyl units. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the successful formation of Dimer 1 on Au(111). Non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) measurements resolve the twisted conformation of the linking para&#8208;biphenyl units for Dimer 1. On the contrary, the inherent flexibility of Dimer 2 induces the planarization of the para&#8208;biphenyl, resulting in the spontaneous formation of two additional five&#8208;membered rings per dimer connected by a single C&#8722;C bond (Dimers 2&#8242;). Furthermore, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic (S=0) coupling of the observed dimers, underscoring the critical influence of dihedral angles and structural flexibility of the linking units in &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic nanostructures.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Gas Sensor of Mixed&#8208;dimensional Heterostructures Combining Borophene and BC2N Quantum Dots: Enhanced Detection through Binary Cooperative Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research introduces a significant advancement in gas sensor technology by decorating two&#8208;dimensional borophene with zero&#8208;dimensional BC2N quantum dots. Integrating theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, our study demonstrates substantial enhancements in NO2 gas sensing performance, with sensors detecting concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;ppm and achieving a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% at 30&#8197;ppm, surpassing current technologies.







Abstract
The emergence of mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures has inspired worldwide interests in recent years, opening up new avenues for potential nanotechnology applications. Herein, we proposed a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterostructure composed of borophene sheets and BC2N quantum dots. The gas sensing performance of the heterostructure was evaluated through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental methods. Specifically, first&#8208;principles calculation results show that NO2 is the most strongly interacting molecule and induces the largest amount of charge transfer between the molecule and the heterostructure, suggesting exceptional sensitivity and selectivity of the heterostructure to NO2 gas. Following the theoretical insights, a borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure gas sensor was developed and its gas detection abilities were assessed with exposure to various gases at room temperature. Remarkably, this sensor displayed a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% to 30&#8197;ppm NO2 and remain a high sensitivity of 108&#8201;% even to 0.2&#8197;ppm NO2. These results highlight borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure as a superior NO2 gas sensor, demonstrating enhanced sensing via BC2N quantum dots and integrated theoretical&#8208;experimental approaches.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Polyester&#8208;Derived Alcohol into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals by Engineering Atomically Dispersed Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs atomically dispersed Pd species on TiO2 catalyst for photoreforming polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into value&#8208;added glycolaldehyde. The Pd single atoms can greatly promote the photocatalytic performance by enriching the photogenerated holes and promoting ethylene glycol adsorption, achieving a high glycolaldehyde yield of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Photoreforming presents a promising strategy for upcycling waste polyester&#8208;derived alcohol into valuable chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge due to its low performance and unsatisfactory selectivity toward high&#8208;value C2 products. Here, we report the highly efficient and selective conversion of ethylene glycol (EG, a monomer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) to glycolaldehyde using atomically dispersed Pd species supported on TiO2 catalyst. A glycolaldehyde production rate of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8901; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO2 enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C1 products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction Enabled by Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction was realized through a synergistic catalysis strategy by merging visible light and chiral Lewis acid, affording enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;amino &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones with high enantioselectivity and good functional group tolerance. The mechanism studies demonstrated a stereoselective radical coupling process.







Abstract
Classical aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction generally involves excess reductants. Herein, we developed a visible light&#8208;induced catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction via a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;assisted direct excitation of imines without additional reductants, enabling the carbon&#8211;iodine bond cleavage of iododifluoromethyl ketones and the subsequent enantioselective radical coupling. This protocol provided an ingenious access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino ketones containing a gem&#8208;difluorine moiety. The mechanistic studies including radical trapping experiment, NMR experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance experiment, cyclic voltammetry experiment and spectroscopic analysis rationalized the reaction process.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Fence Effect in Au Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;fence strategy for tailoring the electrostatic interaction between metal&#8211;organic framework structure and nitroarenes substrate molecules for boosting selective hydrogenation, leading to an excellent conversion (100&#8201;%) of 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene to 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene along with high selectivity and ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 turnover frequency), which provides a novel method to construct efficient catalyst for selective hydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The chemoselective reaction are vital for fine chemicals, which requires economical and environmentally friendly catalysts. In order to improve the selectivity of multi&#8208;reaction competition, herein, we propose a novel ionic&#8208;fence strategy to synthesize heterogeneous catalyst for efficient hydrogenation. Practically, UIO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) modified with pyridinium&#8208;linker has been constructed through post&#8208;synthetic chains with paired anion via quaternization and ion exchange to form ionic&#8208;fence MOF (IFMOF&#8208;Cl), which can manage the adsorption mode of nitro substrate, further confine the formation of metal nanoparticles with high dispersity. The optimal Au@IFMOF&#8208;Cl catalyst demonstrates satisfactory selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro group compared to acetylene group in 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene. Specifically, it owns a high yield of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (~97&#8201;%) with ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF) and long stability, far superior to other catalysts without ionic fence effect. Adsorption experiments and density functional theory studies reveal that the incorporation of ionic fence could modulate the adsorption energy of nitro group, which is responsible for the high selectivity enhancement. Notably, this ionic&#8208;fence strategy exhibits comprehensive universality towards a wide range of substrates (23 kinds in total), providing a promising avenue for precisely engineering the internal microenvironments of catalysts to achieve highly selective synthesis of fine chemicals.

         <title>Direct Upcycling of Degraded LiCoO2 Towards High&#8208;Performance Cathodes via a Multifunctional Organic Lithium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) structure, the deficiency of Li ions severely causes cracks in the particles, leading to a slow diffusion rates and low efficiency of electrons and Li ions. The upgraded lithium cobalt oxide (LRD&#8208;LCO) was obtained by mixing the D&#8208;LCO with lithium lignosulfonate for direct regeneration by one&#8208;step annealing; the LRD&#8208;LCO structure gets integrated and smooth due to Li ions replenishment and doping by elemental Na and S, and the electron and ion transfer rates are enhanced dramatically.







Abstract
Direct recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is a promising technology for resource sustainability and environmental conservation. However, the lithium sources for cathode regeneration are typically mono&#8208;functional, resulting in low performance enhancement of the recycled material. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step direct upcycling method to recycling degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) with lithium lignosulfonate (Li&#8722;L). Li&#8722;L as a multifunctional organic lithium salt can spontaneously attach to the surface of the D&#8208;LCO molecules, thus providing replenishment of Li and doping of elemental sodium and sulfur during the regeneration process. Benefiting from the more stable structure of regenerated LCO supported by Na and S elements, the diffusion efficiency of Li ions and electrons can be improved during charging/discharging. As a result, the cell with upcycling LCO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 220.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and retention rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 10&#8197;C with a maximum cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. More importantly, life&#8208;cycle analysis shows that the upcycling method performs optimally in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as economic benefits, providing a prospective pathway for the large&#8208;scale application of recycling spent batteries.

         <title>Super&#8208;Concentrated Alkali Hydroxide Electrolytes for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturating water with potassium hydroxide revives the grand old alkaline batteries in a rechargeable mode. A triggered proton hopping process break the stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff for super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes.







Abstract
Increasing the salt concentration of an electrolyte to over 10&#8197;M brings new solute&#8208;solvent interactions that define an emerging class of super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. To this class we introduce a super&#8208;concentrated alkaline electrolyte. Nearly saturated with KOH (at 15&#8197;M), the aqueous solution displays a broad electrochemical stability window (&gt;2.5&#8197;V on Au) while retaining an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27&#8197;S/cm at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Without a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, we can confirm the role of electron transfer kinetics in determining the stability as opposed to the thermodyanmic effect computed based on activity coefficients. The compositionally simple solution also allows spectroscopies and ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation to identify a novel mechanism of OH&#8722; structural diffusion, where unlike the conventional Grotthuss mechanism through hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, electrostatic forces sustain proton hopping and break the common stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff. A high ZnO solubility in the electrolyte further mitigate the issue of passivation when a Zn anode is deeply discharged. These unique properties enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity &gt;10&#8197;Ah/cm2 at 40&#8197;mA/cm2 to meet practical needs of safe, inexpensive energy storage.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5 mW/cm2), limiting energy efficiency and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25 mW/cm2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Surface Residues Direct Encapsulation into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Performance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to guide the formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by exposing surface residues of proteins, thereby embedding enzymes into MOFs. Nitrogen&#8208;enriched Cyt&#8197;c serves as a model to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, leading to significantly improve enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency. The strategy is applicable for a variety of enzymes, demonstrating the potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Herein, we highlight the role of nitrogen&#8208;enriched surface groups on proteins in directing topological transformations of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Using a modified&#8208;protein&#8208;directed MOFs template synthesis (mDTS) strategy, we demonstrate that these surface modifications on cytochrome c (Cyt&#8197;c) selectively induce the formation of leaf&#8208;like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;L). This approach not only enables a structural transition from ZIF&#8208;8 to a more open ZIF&#8208;L framework but also substantially enhances the catalytic activity and loading of Cyt&#8197;c beyond traditional immobilization methods. Adjusting the concentration of the surface modifier allows for precise tuning of the Cyt&#8197;c activity, allowing optimal enzyme function at specific modifier levels. Furthermore, our results reveal that surface modifications of a variety of proteins can facilitate the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, emphasizing the broad applicability of the mDTS method. This approach offers significant promise for developing highly efficient protein&#8208;MOF composites, offering transformative potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D Linear Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thermal aggregation, disordered linear polymers are transformed into ordered 2D trapezoidal polymers, which provide migration pathways for ion diffusion, thereby accelerating ion transport. Moreover, thanks to the high ion diffusion, the capacity remains largely unaffected even when the loading increases (from 1 to 6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, benefiting from the exceptionally large conjugated structure, its electrochemical stability is significantly enhanced.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional structure of cathode materials possesses fast kinetics in aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, in organic linear polymers it is rare to form two&#8208;dimensional structures due to the bond rotations of the polymerization reaction. In this work, inspired by the process of forming carbon fibers from polyacrylonitrile, a novel two&#8208;dimensional linear polymer (2DLP) of poly(2H,11H&#8208;bis[l,4]triazino[3,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;m]triphenodithiazine&#8208;3,12&#8208;diyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diyli&#8208;dene&#8208;11,12&#8208;bis[methyldene]) (PTL) cathode materials were prepared for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials by designing ladder structure polymer molecules with highly restricted bond rotations. PTL possess fast cations diffusion (4.27&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) due to its layered structure. Moreover, the PTL electrodes exhibit an ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (7000&#8197;cycles still remain 87&#8201;% capacity remains). Meanwhile, as PTL mass loading increase from 3.13 to 6.27&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the specific capacity kept 98&#8201;% retention after 100&#8197;cycles. Besides, the assembled Zn/PTL flexible pack battery exhibits a 6.6&#8197;mAh capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, though a range of ex site analysis, it was supported that the charge storage mechanism of PTL is driven by the imine moiety, and accompanies by the insertion and extraction of Zn2+/H+ ions. This work attempts to provide a new sight of improve the poor ion diffusion coefficient of organic materials.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Boron Enolates to Construct Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild and convenient method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes. The asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates was also developed, providing efficient access to diverse valuable chiral aldehydes in good yields and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enolates are ubiquitous intermediates in organic synthesis. Among them, boron enolates exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns and selectivities due to the presence of a boron atom, making their synthesis highly attractive. Although methods for accessing ketone&#8208; or ester&#8208;derived boron enolates are well&#8208;developed, much less progress has been made in the development of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates due to aldehydes&#8242; high tendency toward self&#8208;condensation. Therefore, the practical applications of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates are significantly hindered. We present herein an efficient method for the preparation of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes, avoiding the use of acidic R2BCl/R2BOTf and bases and leading to improved functional group tolerance. Utilizing this convenient protocol, we developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates, yielding a wide array of chiral aldehydes bearing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, which are prevalent in various natural products and bioactive molecules. The synthetic utility and practicality of this method are demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale reactions and asymmetric syntheses of the ent&#8208;5HT1&#8197;A antagonist as well as biological activity studies in inhibiting the growth of plant pathogens.

         <title>Mixing Functionality in Polymer Electrolytes: A New Horizon for Achieving High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a supramolecularly extended/cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by introducing an elaborate MBO plasticizer in polymer matrix for ASSLMBs. This innovative PCPE system possesses unique topological cross&#8208;linking structure and Lewis&#8208;acid interaction driven MBO&#8208;salt assembly superstructure, effectively overcomes the discrepancy between accelerating Li+ migration kinetics and enhancing mechanical robustness, thus achieving excellent electrochemical performances of practical ASSLMBs.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are a key materials component for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). In these membrane&#8208;like films, accelerating Li+ migration while enhancing the mechanical strength of SPEs is challenging. Herein, we introduce a new concept of supramolecularly organized, cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by mixing an ion&#8208;conducting, multi&#8208;arm boron&#8208;containing oligomer (MBO) solid plasticizer into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;lithium salt matrix. Studies reveal that the Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron sites of MBO and lithium&#8208;salt anions induces an amorphous MBO&#8208;salt assembly subphase with percolating nanochannels for rapid Li+ transport. Meanwhile, due to the structural compatibility of the multiple linear arms of MBO with PEO, a supramolecular polymer network is obtained which partly crystallizes around the ionic nanodomains, offering an PCPE with improved mechanical strength hosting interconnected ion transport pathways. The resulting PCPE shows simultaneously enhanced ionic conductivity, improved mechanical properties, and film interface stability, which enable a dendrite&#8208;free Li/Li symmetric cell which could be cycled over 2600&#8197;h. Excellent electrochemical performance is also demonstrated in a close&#8208;to&#8208;practical high capacity ASSLMBs.

         <title>Aryl Silicon Nucleophiles in Bismuth Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis is reported, in the context of the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We present a catalytic protocol utilizing bismuth for the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones, showcasing a seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis. This catalytic process is enabled by a series of Bi&#8208;based organometallic transformations, including an unprecedented transmetalation of aryl silicates to Bi(III) complexes and the formal migratory insertion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the Bi&#8208;C bond. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.

         <title>Solvent Chemistry Manipulated Iodine Redox Thermodynamics For Durable Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aprotic solvents with strong electron&#8208;donating properties facilitates charge transfer with iodine and promotes complexation with iodide ions as solvent&#8901;I3&#8722; species, which leads to a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. However, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide ions, which results in one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;).







Abstract
The diverse valences of iodine enable it with multi&#8208;electron transfer capability for energy dense batteries. However, previous studies indicate that the primary I&#8722;/I2 redox couple exhibits distinct behaviors depending on electrolyte choice, with the mechanistic basis of aqueous versus nonaqueous systems remaining unclear. Here, we elucidated the solvent effect on iodine redox, particularly focusing on polyiodide formation and their molecular interaction correlations. We validate that a thermodynamically one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;) occurs in the protic solvents, while it is a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. This distinction arises from strong electron&#8208;donating properties in aprotic solvents that facilitate charge transfer with iodine, promoting complexation with iodide as solvent&#8901;I3&#8722; species.

&lt;p&gt;The aprotic solvents with strong electron-donating properties facilitates charge transfer with iodine and promotes complexation with iodide ions as solvent&#8901;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species, which leads to a two-step transformation (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8596; I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &#8596; I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in aprotic solvents. However, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide ions, which results in one-step conversion reaction (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8596; I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diverse valences of iodine enable it with multi-electron transfer capability for energy dense batteries. However, previous studies indicate that the primary I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox couple exhibits distinct behaviors depending on electrolyte choice, with the mechanistic basis of aqueous versus nonaqueous systems remaining unclear. Here, we elucidated the solvent effect on iodine redox, particularly focusing on polyiodide formation and their molecular interaction correlations. We validate that a thermodynamically one-step conversion reaction (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8596; I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) occurs in the protic solvents, while it is a two-step transformation (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8596; I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &#8596; I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in aprotic solvents. This distinction arises from strong electron-donating properties in aprotic solvents that facilitate charge transfer with iodine, promoting complexation with iodide as solvent&#8901;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species. Conversely, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide. Furthermore, to address the limitations of single protic electrolytes &#8211; characterized by sluggish dissolution-precipitation and slow ion migration rates &#8211; we propose a hybrid electrolyte combining water and ethylene glycol.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Circular Photogalvanic Effects in Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskite Ferroelectric&#8208;based Transistor toward Multi&#8208;state Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement multi&#8208;state memory behavior through gate&#8208;tunable circular photogalvanic effects in the transistor device based on a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of perovskite ferroelectrics for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of integrated devices.







Abstract
Spintronics has long been an exciting branch of condensed matter science, among which the spin splitting of energy bands in an inversion asymmetric material endows the circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE) toward high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, we have successfully achieved gate&#8208;tunable CPGE in a biaxial perovskite ferroelectric (n&#8208;HA)2CsPb2Br7 (1, n&#8208;HA is n&#8208;heptanamine), involving the broken symmetry from its spontaneous polarization. Strikingly, under left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, this CPGE acquires a large anisotropy factor for photocurrents up to ~1.04, far beyond most organic semiconductors and chiral counterparts (&lt;0.2). It is the large splitting coefficient along the ky direction (~1.476&#8197;eV &#197;) that contributes to the significant realization of CPGE in 1. Notably, this spin&#8208;based CPGE of 1 has been modulated via the gate&#8208;voltage manipulation in its transistor&#8208;type devices, leading to multi&#8208;state memory behaviors. That is, six distinct conductance states are obtained under circularly polarized light, containing the original, high/low&#8208;state responses L(&#8208;1,0,1) to the left circularly polarized light, as well as three right components R(&#8208;1,0,1). This study establishes a pathway for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of ferroelectric integrated devices.

         <title>Can Electroactive Tracer Molecules Reveal Viscoelastic Structure by Measuring Non&#8208;Fickian Diffusion?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voltage scans of duration t electrolyze reducer R to oxidizer O yielding peak&#8208;currents (Ip). The ensuing concentration gradient of R induces a diffusion rate towards the electrode that peaks at Ip and decays as 1/t1/2. Plotting log of Ip2 vs. 1/t&#945; introduces diffusion exponent &#945; as slope indicator of &#8220;free&#8221; Fickian diffusion (&#945;=1) in viscous liquids and &#8220;hindered&#8221; Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208;diffusion (&#945;&lt;1) in viscoelastic hydrogels.







Abstract
We find that viscous and viscoelastic fluids are distinguishable by gauging Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of dissolved electroactive molecules. Typically, such fluids are differentiated by measuring the mean&#8208;squared&#8208;displacement &lt;&#916;r2&gt; of embedded tracer particles (~1&#8197;&#956;m) diffusing over time (t). From the relationship &lt;&#916;r2&gt;=6Dt&#945; (D=particle diffusivity), log plots of &lt;&#916;r2&gt;vs.t&#945; reveal regimes encoded in the slope &#945;. For Fickian diffusion &#945;=1, whereas &#945;&lt;1 and &#945;&gt;1, indicate Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208; and super&#8208;diffusion, respectively. Here, we electrolyzed redox reporters as molecular tracers in selected fluids. The current (I) relationship I

 ${\propto }$



v1/2 (v=scan&#8208;rate) was recast as I2vs.1/t&#945; to introduce &#945; as Non&#8208;Fickian quantifier in log plots. When viscosity increased at high concentration of small&#8208;molecules, D for the redox reporter declined but &#945; remained constant at ~1 (Fickian). In contrast, both D and &#945;(&lt;1) decreased in viscoelastic hydrogels confirming a molecular sub&#8208;diffusive regime. These results agree with particle microrheology on the same fluid types using optical methods that are inapplicable to molecules. By quantifying Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of electroactive molecular tracers, our method can uncover diffusion&#8208;structure relationships to identify regulators in neurodegenerative liquid&#8208;solid transitions of protein aggregates. Unlike tracer particles, the diffusivity of tracer molecules is controlled by the applied potential and electrode size.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Assisted Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Unsymmetric Internal Alkynes by Scandium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;assisted regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetric internal alkynes including homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and amines with hydrosilanes has been achieved by using half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst, providing an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized silylalkenes with high regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes is the most straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient method for the synthesis of silylalkenes. However, the hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes often encounters regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity challenges. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes bearing heteroatom functional groups with hydrosilanes by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. This protocol offers an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized multisubstituted silylalkenes from a variety of internal homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and tertiary amines and hydrosilanes, featuring 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and excellent regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 r.r. and &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 syn/anti). The mechanistic details have been elucidated by control experiments and isolation and examination of some key reaction intermediates. It was revealed that an interaction between the heteroatom (O, S or N) in the internal alkynes and the Sc center was critical for achieving the unprecedented high selectivity.

         <title>Manipulating &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions in Halogenated Additives for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells with 19.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Two halogenated volatile solid additives DBB and DFBB selected to improve photovoltaic performance has been systematically studied. Our results demonstrate that the addition of DFBB with a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes compared to DBB can regulate the multi&#8208;scale morphology to achieve a superior efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO and 19.8&#8201;% for D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO. This work provides valuable insights to develop volatile additives for high performance OSCs.







Abstract
The incorporation of volatile solid additives has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the influence of the electronic structure of these additives on morphological evolution remains insufficiently understood. Herein, 1,4&#8208;Dibromobenzene (DBB) and 1,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;2,5&#8208;dibromobenzene (DFBB) are introduced as volatile additives into OSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that DFBB has a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes interaction compared to DBB, enabling more robust intermolecular interactions with acceptors. The synergistic halogen interactions between DFBB and the active layer matrix balances the differences in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor during the film formation process, promotes the formation of dense molecular packing and ordered orientation, optimizes the vertical composition distribution, and promotes the formation of domain sizes close to the exciton diffusion distance. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated with DFBB achieves an efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% with a fill factor (FF) of 80.8&#8201;%, which is superior to the control and DBB. Further validation across various systems, including PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, highlights similar efficiency enhancements, with the D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO system achieving an outstanding PCE of 19.8&#8201;%. This work demonstrates that the modulation of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in volatile additives can effectively optimize multi&#8208;scale morphology for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Initiated N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Polymerization for the Design of Stereostructural Dobby Polypeptides with Jellyfish&#8208;Type Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dobby polypeptides with unique jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures are synthesized via &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride. Their biocompatible building blocks, efficient synthesis, well&#8208;defined structures and excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities render the jellyfish&#8208;type polypeptides as promising candidates for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Strict criteria of biomedical materials in synthesis efficiency, structure determinacy, and biological safety pose formidable challenges for the synthesis of dobby polypeptides. Herein we reported a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine (TMG)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) strategy to synthesize a series of dobby polypeptides that fulfill the criteria of biomedical materials. By leveraging TMG's catalytic mechanisms in nucleophilicity enhancement for CD hydroxyl groups and active center creation for NCA monomers, this strategy achieves efficient NCA polymerization within 2&#8197;hours and high monomer conversion up to 93.5&#8201;%. Meticulous characterizations illustrate that CD&#8208;centric polypeptides present jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures, in which the arm number, length, orientation and initiation sites are precisely determined. Simultaneously, CD&#8208;centric polypeptides possess excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities to guide nanostructure fabrication, exhibiting broad&#8208;spectrum small&#8208;molecule drug encapsulation. Additionally, natural CD applied in multipoint initiation of core&#8208;first NCA ROP fundamentally improves the biodegradability and biosafety of dobby polypeptides, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.

         <title>Niobium Phosphide&#8208;Induced Sulfur Cathode Interface with Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Flux Enables Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbP induces the decomposition of lithium salts, which resulting in the formation of a LiF&#8208; and LiN&#8208;rich interfacial layer at the sulfur cathode interface for facilitating high&#8208;flux Li+ transport. The optimized interface reduces the conversion energy barrier of Li2S and effectively prevents the passivation of catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Research on the Li&#8722;S catalytic chemistry primarily focus on the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts and the exploration of their reaction mechanisms, with limited attention given to the impact on the interface at the cathode. Moreover, regulating the Li+ flux at the cathode interface can enhance Li2S conversion kinetics without compromising the intrinsic catalytic activity of catalyst. This work presents a paradigm that employs interface regulation to enhance Li&#8722;S battery (LSB) cycling stability. A novel phosphorus doped carbon supported niobium phosphide nanocrystals (NbP/PC) catalyst is developed and demonstrates exceptional intrinsic activity for lithium polysulfide conversion while it facilitates lithium salt dissociation through intermolecular hybridization. The NbP&#8208;induced functional interface layer with abundant LiF and Li3N provides efficient Li+ transport channel for Li2S decomposition, which further mitigates the passivation of active sites. In consequence, the assembled LSB exhibits a capacity retention rate of 0.04&#8201;% per cycle after 1100 cycles at a 1&#8197;C. Furthermore, the pouch battery with an energy density of 451&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 maintains stable performance over 20 cycles. This strategy addresses the limitations of traditional catalytic material design in the chemical regulation of the cathodic interface for promising future of LSBs.

         <title>Spin Polarization&#8208;Boosting Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics and Exciton Dissociation in Fe Nanoparticle&#8208;Loading Graphitic Carbon Nitride toward Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of exciton properties plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of photocatalysts, primarily due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs caused by the strong Coulomb interaction between them. In this study, we explore the spin polarization effect in nanohybrids composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, which accelerates exciton dissociation and spin&#8208;selective electron transfer, thereby improving the selective photoreduction of CO2 into CO. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs, embedded in the iron oxide layer on the surface of Fe nanoparticles, function as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via a double exchange interaction (Fe2+&#8211;O&#8211;Fe3+). This process facilitates spin&#8208;selective electron transfer from g&#8208;C3N4 to Fe species, thereby contributing to the efficient conversion of CO2. This work provides novel insights into the design of spin&#8208;dependent photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate (PMS) addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Oxygen Evolution Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antifluorite Prelithiation Agent Based on Anionic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for irreversible lithium loss is crucial for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Antifluorite Li&#8208;rich Li5FeO4 (LFO) is a promising prelithiation agent due to its high theoretical capacity (867 mAh/g) and superior decomposition dynamic (&lt; 4.0 V versus. Li/Li+). However, the oxygen evolution mechanism in LFO remains unclear, limiting its application as an ideal prelithiation agent. Herein, we systematically track the full lifecycle oxygen footprint in LFO lattice, electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface (SEI). We demonstrate the lattice mismatch induced by the quasi&#8208;disorder rocksalt intermediate phase can activate the lattice oxygen oxidation promoting the dimerization to O2. Specifically, in contrast to the O&#8208;O dimers formed within typical anionic&#8208;redox active cathodes, the oxidation of lattice oxygen in LFO generates O&#8208; stabilized in Li6&#8208;O configuration. Significantly, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O configurations transforms into a superoxo dimer, which further evolves into O2 via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process. Moreover, we demonstrate that nucleophilic intermediates threaten the stability of electrolytes and SEI. Leveraging the insights above, we offer comprehensive perspectives for the modification of ideal prelithiation agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Electrolysis for Recovering Transmembrane Carbon Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 electrolysis in alkaline media presents advantages by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and enhancing the CO2 reduction selectivity. However, it suffers from the carbonation issue, leading to substantial carbon loss due to CO2 transmembrane transport. To tackle this issue, we here put forward a redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy. By integrating a highly reversible redox couple, this approach spatially separates the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic oxygen evolution reactions into two electrolyzers, thereby enabling the recovery and reuse of transmembrane CO2. Anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) was chosen as the redox mediator owing to its suitable redox potential, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high solubility, and non&#8208;transmembrane shuttling characteristics. It allowed the RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis system to operate continuously at 100 mA/cm2, maintaining a high faradaic efficiency for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion consistently around 90%, while effectively capturing the transmembrane CO2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration validates the feasibility of RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis and highlights its significant potential to advance the practical application of CO2 electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Valence Engineering via Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced on Vanadium Centers for Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered vanadium&#8208;based compounds have attracted attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundant vanadium valence states. However, the slow migration of Zn2+ ions and their poor cycling stability hinder their practical application in AZIBs. Herein, using a one pot solvothermal method, the polyoxometalates (POMs) were inserted into the aluminum vanadate interlayer spacing, and a series of novel three&#8208;dimensional nanoflower cathode materials (HAVO&#8208;MMo6&#8208;X) were successfully fabricated. The unique electron&#8208;rich structure of the POMs accelerated the migration of Zn2+ on the cathode to obtain a high specific capacity. Owing to the synergistic pillar effect of POMs and HAVO, the interlayer spacing of HAVO&#8208;FeMo6&#8208;50 increased to approximately 14.33 &#197;. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to analyze the coordination environments of the cathode materials. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques demonstrated the storage mechanism of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the introduction of POMs had the dual function of improving conductivity and reducing the Zn2+ migration barrier. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Key Properties that Drive Redox Mediator Activity in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is known to utilize exogenous small molecule quinone mediators to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), allowing it to produce a detectable current in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2); however, structural variations in the core of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone EET mediators have shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone&#8208;based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (&#916;Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and &#916;Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum, and each generated Ndh2&#8208;dependent current over background signal. Importantly, an amine&#8208;containing mediator yielded incredibly stable current output over the course of the experiment (up to 5 days). These findings improve our understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships for quinone&#8208;mediated EET and provide stable mediators for bioelectronic sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LIBX&#8208;A401: A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Its Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid metabolism is essential for cellular homeostasis, and its disruption is linked to various diseases. Acyl&#8208;coenzyme A synthetase long&#8208;chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism, has emerged as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis&#8208;related conditions and cancer. Antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone is the reference ACSL4 inhibitor. However, its potent activity on peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), a key regulator of lipid metabolism, represents a significant limitation. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of LIBX&#8208;A401 (compound 9), a potent ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone but devoid of PPAR&#947; activity. We showed that its binding to ACSL4 is ATP&#8208;dependent. Using Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry, we demonstrate that ATP binding stabilizes the ACSL4 C&#8208;terminus, with LIBX&#8208;A401 further stabilizing this domain and altering the fatty acid gate&#8208;region. Photoaffinity labeling with a diazirine probe identified A329 within the fatty acid binding site, while molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for LIBX&#8208;A401 binding. LIBX&#8208;A401 exhibits significant anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supported by demonstrated target engagement. These findings position LIBX&#8208;A401 as a valuable tool for studying ACSL4 in ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases and cancer, while its elucidated binding mode paves the way to the rational design of improved ACSL4 inhibitors with therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesise arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#223;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.</dc:description>

DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Degradation of Polycaprolactone into Adipic Acids over Pt/TiO2 in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading polyester wastes into high value&#8208;added chemicals can achieve carbon recycling, which is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot protocol to oxidatively degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) with air into adipic acid (AA) mediated by ionic liquid (IL, e.g., 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [BMIm][NTf2]) in water. In this protocol, IL catalyzes the hydrolysis of PCL into 6&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid (6&#8208;HHA), and further mediates the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA into AA over TiO2 supported Pt nanocatalysts, reaching the highest AA yield of 85.6% under relatively mild conditions (140 &#176;C, 1.5 MPa). Mechanism investigation indicates that both O2&#8226;&#8208; and &#8226;OH derived from oxygen and water involve in the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA to form 6&#8208;oxohexanoic acid&#160;via two pathways, which further convert into AA. The IL inhibits the overoxidation of AA, thus leading to a high selectivity towards AA. This protocol provides a green and feasible way to degrade PCL, and also to access AA.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Circularity via Chemical Recycling to All Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc., via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triphenylamine&#8208;Functionalized Co&#8208;Assembly Material for Record Efficiency Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High quality distribution and surface modification of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and stability of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a new co&#8208;assembly material, 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAMs orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) characterization unveil that TPAI can bind with SAMs through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to effectively diminish SAMs aggregation and improve the orderly assembly of SAMs. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations confirm that the co&#8208;assembly TPAI could bind with upward perovskite by &#8211;NH3 and Pb interaction for spreading the perovskite solution and improving the quality of perovskite film. The obtained favorable buried interface between SAMs and perovskite augmented hole extraction and transfer capability. Consequently, the TPAI&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs achieve a high VOC of 1.26 V, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.60%, the highest reported PCE for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, maintaining 96.71% initial PCE after tracking at maximum power point (MPP) for 1400 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Ethylene Dimerization over Well&#8208;defined Nickel&#8208;zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene dimerization&#160;is a crucial chemical process, which currently relies on organo&#8208;metallic&#160;catalysis with&#160;the assistance&#160;of overdosed&#160;additives as cocatalysts. Heterogeneous&#160;nickel catalysts&#160;have been investigated as alternatives for ethylene dimerization, however suffer from low catalytic activity and/or poor 1&#8208;butene selectivity. Herein, we report a simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization. Typically, Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y shows unprecedent performance with 1&#8208;butene formation rate of 3.8&#180;105&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;and 1&#8208;butene selectivity of 91.2 %, comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous and heterogeneous nickel catalysts but without the assistance of any cocatalysts. With the combination of advanced characterization techniques and comprehensive&#160;theoretical simulations, it has been demonstrated for the first time&#160;that the in&#8208;situ&#160;generated Ni&#8208;alkyl motif is the intrinsic active site and ethylene dimerization proceeds dominantly via&#160;the Cossee&#8208;Arlman pathway. The dynamic hydrogen transfer&#160;between ethylene/alkyl ligand and zeolite framework dedicates to the observed catalytic performance, resembling of the role of cocatalyst in homogeneous nickel catalysis. This work not only provides an effective strategy for developing eligible&#160;catalysts for additive&#8208;free ethylene dimerization&#160;to 1&#8208;butene,&#160;but also offers valuable insights into bridging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual 1,1&#8208;Dicarboxylation Selectivity in the Domino Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with Formate and Application in Polyimides Photoresist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report for the first time a photoinduced domino 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of malonic acid derivatives using a cesium formate solution (80% w/w in water), which is different from previous dicarboxylation methods that usually produce succinic acids. Interestingly, solid cesium formate with additional water led to mono&#8208;carboxylation product. Mechanism experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the malonic acid derivative is formed through the &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to a cinnamate intermediate. This method enables direct preparation of water&#8208;soluble carboxylate&#8208;functionalized molecules and polymers from hydrophobic alkyne&#8208;containing precursors, showing potential usability in photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Yb3+&#8208;Induced Bright Ligand Up&#8208;Conversion Luminescence in 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ln3+&#8208;induced ligand up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) in coordination polymers (CPs) effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional organic UCL mechanisms. However, current research on UCL in Ln&#8208;CPs has predominantly focused on the UCL of Ln&#179;&#8314; ions themselves, while investigations into Ln&#179;&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL have been overlooked in Ln&#8208;CPs. Herein, by doping Yb&#179;&#8314; into the Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n (1) (FCA = 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), we have prepared Yb3+&#8208;doped 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n ( x = 0.2, 2; x = 0.5, 3; x = 0.7, 4; x = 0.9, 5; x = 1, 6). Investigation of the UCL of FCA in these CPs reveals that Ln&#179;&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL were achieved for the first time.

However, current research on UCL in Ln-CPs has predominantly focused on the UCL of Ln&#179;&#8314; ions themselves, while investigations into Ln&#179;&#8314;-induced ligand UCL have been overlooked in Ln-CPs. Herein, by doping Yb&#179;&#8314; into the Ln-CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n (1) (FCA = 9-fluorenone-2-carboxylic acid), we have prepared Yb3+-doped 1D chain Ln-CPs of [Y2-2xYb2x(FCA)6]n ( x = 0.2, 2; x = 0.5, 3; x = 0.7, 4; x = 0.9, 5; x = 1, 6). Investigation of the UCL of FCA in these CPs reveals that Ln&#179;&#8314;-induced ligand UCL were achieved for the first time. Notably, 4 not only displays bright UCL under both 10 W/cm&#178; and 15 W/cm&#178; excitation power of 980 nm laser, but also achieves an absolute UCQY of 0.003%, opening new avenues for the development of Ln-CPs as UCL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8208;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cofactors, particularly 1,4&#8208;NADH, is crucial for advancing oxidoreductase catalysis. Electrocatalysis provides a promising route for 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration, but the expensive catalyst, typically a rhodium organometallic complex, is frequently required to guarantee the high selectivity of 1,4&#8208;NADH, significantly limiting its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction in nature, a direct electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed by modification of the surface of nickel oxide (NiO) with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) (denoted as CB[8]&#8208;NiO). The host&#8208;guest interaction between CB[8] and NAD+ was proved, which is similar in principle to substrate&#8208;enzyme&#8208;specific recognition. CB[8] acted as a catalytic pocket for NAD+, providing a suitable cavity volume to accommodate the molecule of NAD+. NAD+ entered the CB[8] cavity and approached the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to achieve the regioselective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. Remarkably higher 1,4&#8208;NADH selectivity of 97.8% on CB[8]&#8208;NiO was obtained at &#8722;0.47 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) than that of bare NiO (77.4%).</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;minute Fabrication of Metal Organic Framework Membranes via Additive&#8208;accelerated Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient fabrication of metal organic framework (MOF) membranes is important for their broad applications in molecular separations. However, current approaches for MOF membrane fabrication are usually time&#8208;consuming due to the slow, random nucleation and crystal growth, particularly the lack of in&#8208;situ defect healing ability. Here, we report an additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition method, which allows ultrafast fabrication of MOF membranes through the synergy of electric field and catecholamine additives. The strong electric field facilitates the directed nucleation of MOF on the substrates while the multifunctional additives accelerate the MOF crystallization, growth and grain&#8208;boundary defect healing. Consequently, we fabricate well&#8208;intergrown, uniform MOF (ZIF&#8208;8) membranes with an ultrathin thickness of ~180 nm in 30 seconds, which is the most rapid fabrication of MOF membranes till now. The membranes exhibit superior C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with a C3H6 permeance of 145 GPU and a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151 as well as good stability at high pressure of 7 bar, and the ultrafast membrane fabrication can be achieved on commercial ceramic substrates, exhibiting the potential for practical applications. This work may establish a platform for fast and controllable fabrication of MOF membranes as well as many other membranes based on metal&#8208;coordination chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Fused Propellanes: A Geometrically Rigid multihelicene Nanocarbon with Ampli&#64257;ed Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis of a geometrically distinct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral nanocarbon, which is composed of three &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene subunits fused on a [3,3,3]propellane with P,P,M/M,M,P con&#64257;gurations in the helicene subunits. This nanocarbon can isomerize into the thermodynamically more stable isomer with PPP/MMM con&#64257;gurations in the helicene subunits. Both 3D nanocarbons display a very stable configuration, which can be separated by chiral HPLC. Notably, the nanocarbons display significantly enhanced chiroptical properties compared to the refer&#8208;ence &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene, due to the improved alignment of magnetic and electric transition dipole moments. The twisted [6]helicene subunits in the nanocarbon provide concave surfaces that are suitable&#8211;albeit relatively weak&#8211;host for C60, forming a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Short&#8208;path Hydrogen Spillover&#160;on CeO2&#8208;Supported PtPd Nanoclusters for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen spillover&#160;in supported&#160;metal electrocatalysts has garnered significant research attention owing to its potential to enhance the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the design of such electrocatalysts faces critical challenges, including the facilitation of hydrogen spillover and the reduction of its associated energy barriers.&#160;Herein, PtPd alloy clusters are anchored to the CeO2&#160;surface, enabling short&#8208;path hydrogen spillover in heterogeneous catalysts and lowering&#160;the reaction energy barrier&#160;in acidic environments. During&#160;the&#160;HER process, hydrogen is initially adsorbed on the noble metal surface and subsequently migrates&#160;to the interface, rather than precipitating&#160;directly on the CeO2&#160;surface. This&#160;interface exhibits&#160;a near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (0.023 eV).&#160;Consequently,&#160;the catalyst demonstrates an exceptionally low&#160;overpotential of only 5.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in acidic media, along with remarkable&#160;long&#8208;term stability. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of highly efficient HER electrocatalysts for acidic environments based on hydrogen spillover mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Against the Wallach's rule through Rational Design of Metal&#8208;free Chiral Perovskites towards Efficient Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential applications of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials in chiroptical devices have attracted considerable interest. Nevertheless, the design of efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescent pure organic materials remain a significant challenge, largely due to the limitations imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law and Wallach's rule. In this study, we employed the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite strategy to overcome these restrictions. The introduction of cyclohexylenediammonium cations as the A&#8208;site of chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites resulted in the generation of an efficient near&#8208;infrared/red phosphorescence at 637 nm with a lifetime of up to 227.98 &#956;s. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can reach up to 71.22%, accompanied by an anisotropy factor of 9.8&#215;10&#8208;3. The Figure of merit (FM = PLQY&#215; |glum|) is 6.98&#215;10&#8208;3, which is the highest value achieved among all the pure organic circularly polarized phosphorescent materials. Our work proposes a unique strategy to achieve highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence based on non&#8208;conjugated luminophores, which is accomplished by combining the superior optical and electronic properties of metal&#8208;free perovskites with chirality based on the rational molecular design.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Relay catalysis represents significant efficacy in alleviating competition among different reactants during coupling reactions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism underlying relay catalysis for the urea electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, we have developed a catalyst (CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC) comprising Cu atomic clusters (CuAC) with satellite Cu&#8722;N4 single atoms (CuSA) sites on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous interconnected carbon skeleton (NC), enabling elucidation of a relay catalysis process for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;.

         <title>Anomalous Magnetic Hysteresis up to 20 K in a Non&#8208;Kramers Light&#8208;Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;lanthanides (Ln), despite their widespread uses in commercial permanent magnets, are among the least explored metal elements as building blocks of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their smaller magnetic moments as well as weaker spin&#8211;orbit couplings than those of the heavy&#8208;Ln counterparts, and so far only a neodymium (Nd) complex has been reported showing a small magnetic hysteresis at 2 K. Here we report a low&#8208;coordination praseodymium (Pr) complex, namely Pr@C81N, featuring a non&#8208;Kramers trivalent Pr ion entrapped within an azafullerene cage and behaving as the first Pr&#8208;based SMM. Although the weak non&#8208;axial ligand field imposed only by the carbon cage on the integer&#8208;spin Pr(III) elicits nondegenerate spin states, Pr@C81N shows an anomalous magnetic hysteresis up to 20 K using a field sweep rate of 20 Oe/s, which is the highest temperature among all reported light&#8208;Ln SMMs. In addition to the ideally minimized spin&#8208;phonon coupling in the low coordination, the origin of such an unexpected magnetic bistability for the non&#8208;Kramers complex likely lies in nuclear sublevels arising from a large Pr hyperfine coupling, which feature distinct electronic magnetizations within the highly mixed ground electronic state.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Asymmetric Electronic Structure of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atomic Sites toward Excellent Electrochemical H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To advance electrochemical H2O2 production and unravel catalytic mechanisms, the precise structural coordination of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts is urgently required. Herein, the Co&#8208;N5 site with an asymmetric electronic configuration is constructed to boost the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) compared to symmetric Co&#8208;N4, effectively overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity in H2O2 production. Both experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that breaking the symmetry of Co&#8208;N sites promotes the activation of O2 molecules and moderates the adsorption of the key *OOH intermediates by disrupting the linear scaling relationship for intermediate adsorption. This modulation enables efficient H2O2 production and its effective retention for subsequent applications. As a proof of concept, Co&#8208;N5 achieves a H2O2 production rate as high as 16.1 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in a flow cell, outperforming most recently reported counterparts. Furthermore, the coupling of 2e&#8208; ORR with the oxidation of cellulose&#8208;derived carbohydrates accomplishes high formic acid yields (84.1% from glucose and 62.0&#8211;92.1% from other substrates), underpinning the sustainable electro&#8208;refinery for biomass valorization at ambient conditions. By elucidating the intrinsic relationship between 2e&#8722; ORR and the asymmetry of single&#8208;atomic sites, this work paves the way for high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Formamide via an Oxidant&#8208;Free Photoinduced Radical Coupling Route over Pt&#8208;CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large&#8208;scale manufacturing of formamide is always involved with the use of carbon monoxide, hence developing a series of eco&#8208;friendly synthesis routes is of great significance. Alternative feedstock of low&#8208;cost methanol is expected to fulfill this breakthrough due to its green and renewable nature, however, the overoxidation of methanol severely inhibits the efficacious formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia through the conventional catalytic route. Herein, we report the successful development of a direct radical coupling route for converting methanol and ammonia into high&#8208;selectivity formamide and hydrogen without extra oxidants under ambient conditions. The optimized Pt&#8208;CdS photocatalysts offered an impressive formamide production rate of 1.45 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, as well as an exceptional hole selectivity reaching up to 63.5%. The oxidant&#8208;free radical mechanism of high&#8208;efficiency formamide generation as revealed by in situ characterizations (e.g., in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ transient absorption spectroscopy), stemmed from the photogenerated holes oxidizing the methanol to hydroxymethyl radical for subsequently direct C&#8722;N coupling with amino radical. This work demonstrates an efficient oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced radical coupling strategy with the promise of an acceptable alternative to current technologies for artificial photosynthesis formamide using clean and abundant solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Solvolysis Reaction Dynamics under Electrostatic Catalysis and Proton Tunneling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A central goal of chemical mechanism research is to provide a comprehensive interpretation of chemical reaction pathways to clarify the evolution patterns of reactions. In this work, we present an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in&#8208;situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through the precise control of an oriented external electric field, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and elucidate their roles in the solvolysis reaction. Both temperature&#8208; and isotope&#8208;dependent experiments, in combination with theoretical simulations, reveal crucial roles for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer and the proton&#8208;tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This work highlights the precise manipulation of chemical reactions by electrostatic field and opens up a universal route to discover unknown intermediates or novel phenomena in the processes of material transformation and life activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Reversibility and Kinetics of Heterovalent Ion&#8208;Substituted Mn&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogue Cathodes via Intervalence Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn3+ (d4) in manganese&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) exhibits intrinsic orbital degeneracy upon sodiation/desodiation, resulting in severe Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which causes rapid capacity decay and sluggish kinetics. Unfortunately, traditional modification strategies are deficient for electronic tuning of Mn3+ to address these issues. Herein, Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions is unraveled in a series of novel V3+&#8208;substituted MnPBA to enhance electrochemical reaction reversibility and kinetics. Precisely, IVCT drives electron distribution from localized to delocalized, achieves electronic coupling and mitigates Jahn&#8208;Teller by transferring a single&#8208;electron of Mn3+ eg orbital. Notably, the reported Na1.2V0.63Mn0.58Fe(CN)6 cathode demonstrates incredible rate capability (136.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 mA g&#8208;1 and 94.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1), remarkable long&#8208;cycle stability (91.6% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 20 mA g&#8208;1 and 90.7% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1), and robust performance across a wide temperature range (98.59% capacity after 300 cycles at &#8208;30&#176;C and 50 mA g&#8208;1), surpassing the majority of reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes. The intrinsic functioning mechanisms of IVCT and quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanisms were adequately understood through systematic in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations. This study further develops electron&#8208;tuning of PBA, opening a new avenue toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiazolium&#8208;linked Crystalline Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks for Mixed Electronic&#8208;ionic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficiently mixed electronic&#8208;ionic (MEI) conductive pathways within a single functional material at the microscale is essential yet challenging for various electronic devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) feature pre&#8208;designed functionalities and uniform pores, making them highly desirable platforms for the transport of electrons and ions. However, for MEI conductive COFs, achieving high crystallinity when incorporating high&#8208;density ionic groups within the extensively &#960;&#8208;electron delocalized skeletons remains a challenge due to intermolecular interactions. Herein, we reported a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach to synthesize new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs, M = Cu, Co, Fe), where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. These MEICOFs demonstrated broad ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared absorption bands and narrow band gaps. As a proof of concept, the mixed electronic and hydroxide ionic conductivity of CuEICOF were determined to be 55.2 and 0.01 S m&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, MEICOFs film could directly catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction without additional conductive agent and the rotation of electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Disentangling Radiative and Non&#8208;radiative Deactivation Pathways in&#160;CuI &#8208;based TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid&#8208;state CuI complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh3)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes &#964;(T) into their radiative and non&#8208;radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST&#160;from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non&#8208;radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(T)&#160;data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by kISC in the studied compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Ordered Polymorphism of Small Molecule Acceptor Delivering Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancements in narrow bandgap organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies beyond 20%. Achieving this milestone necessitates precise control over the active layer morphology, particularly its crystallinity and phase distribution, to optimize light absorption, charge transport, and suppress charge recombination. However, controlling SMA morphology remains a significant challenge due to their strong aggregation tendency. Existing methods, including high&#8208;temperature annealing and introducing high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point additives, frequently yield disordered polymorphs with limited scalability. Here, we report a novel approach utilizing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive to induce the formation of a highly ordered polymorph of BTP&#8208;eC9 through mild annealing at 60 &#176;C. This marks the first demonstration of such an ordered SMA polymorph, exhibiting optical properties comparable to ideal crystals, including enhanced anisotropy, refractive index, and extinction coefficients. The specific polymorph further enables the formation of a well&#8208;organized PM6 donor arrangement, establishing an optimal bicontinuous network morphology. Consequently, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.53%, which further increases to 20.32% with the addition of an anti&#8208;reflection layer. This work provides a scalable and effective strategy for enhancing OSC performance and highlights the critical role of polymorphism in optimizing photovoltaic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Whole&#8208;cell Lysosome SMLM Imaging as Indicators for Functional Diagnostics with a Low&#8208;Phototoxic Spontaneously Blinking Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics are closely linked to lysosome functions, making long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging of whole&#8208;cell lysosomes a potential indicator for functional diagnostics. However, the phototoxicity of probes in SMLM imaging often compromises the reliability of the observed lysosomal dynamics. Here, we developed Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a spontaneously blinking silicon rhodamine probe with near&#8208;infrared excitation, enabling low phototoxicity, long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomal morphology, and pH dynamics for up to 50 minutes. This probe enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of key lysosomal characteristics&#8212;distribution, size, and lumen pH&#8212;critical for understanding lysosomal dynamics and their physiological and pathological roles. By analyzing these parameters, we investigated lysosomal function under acidosis and starvation and evaluated the effects of seven anticancer drugs (paclitaxel, rapamycin, periplocoside, metformin, erastin, polyphyllin and gefitinib). Our results revealed that periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while other drugs generally induced an increase. Notably, paclitaxel elevated lysosomal pH and led to a sparser lysosomal distribution. These findings underscore the potential of Aze&#8208;HMSiR as a powerful tool for diagnosing lysosomal function and monitoring dynamic changes in response to physiological conditions and pharmacological treatments, establishing it as a robust platform for functional diagnostics and drug screening, particularly in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;isomerization of&#160;azobenzene&#8208;extended&#160;charybdotoxin for the optical control of Kv1.2 potassium channel activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural peptides from animal venoms effectively modulate ion channel activity. While photoswitches regulate small compound pharmacology, their application to&#160;natural&#160;peptides&#160;rich in disulfide bridges and active on ion channels&#160;is novel due to larger pharmacophores. We initiated a pilot study integrating azobenzene photoswitches into charybdotoxin (ChTx), known for blocking potassium channels.&#160;Two click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;compatible azobenzene were synthesized differing in length and amide orientation (Az1&#160;&amp; Az2).&#160;Az1&#160;was&#160;grafted onto ChTx at various amino acid positions using L&#8208;azidohomoalanine mutation. ChTx monomers outperformed dimers, particularly with azobenzene at position 14, by exhibiting optimal photoswitching activity. In the&#160;cis&#160;configuration,&#160;Az1&#160;altered ChTx's pharmacophore, reducing potassium channel blockage,&#160;while conversely Az2&#160;increased ChTx potency. This study pioneers photoswitch application to complex peptides, leveraging structure&#8208;activity relationships. Successful integration depends on precise azobenzene positioning and chemical grafting guided by SAR insights. This advancement underscores the adaptability of photoswitch technology to intricate peptide structures, offering new avenues for pharmacological modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Degradation of ZBP1 with Covalent PROTACs for Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Z&#8208;DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) has emerged as a critical pathogen&#8208;sensing protein that, upon activation, triggers necroptotic signaling cascades, leading to a potent inflammatory response and potentially causing significant tissue damage. However, available drugs specifically developed for the effective inhibition or degradation of ZBP1 is still lack so far. In this study, we developed a potent covalent recognition&#8208;based PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) molecule for the degradation of ZBP1. It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA&#8208;containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1&#8208;PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation&#8208;inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Ethylene/Acrylate Copolymers  Synthesized with Highly Active Neutral Nickel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular weight is a crucial parameter in catalytic olefin polymerization to determine the thermomechanical properties of polymers. Elevating the molecular weight of ethylene/acrylate copolymer, a typical polar polyolefin, has been a persistent challenge. This study presents the direct synthesis of ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (UHMW) ethylene/acrylate copolymers using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component phosphine&#8208;phenolate nickel catalyst under mild conditions. The coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and various acrylates, such as methyl acrylate, n&#8208;butyl acrylate, and t&#8208;butyl acrylate, can yield ethylene/acrylate copolymers with UHMWs (Mn) ranging from 1,000 to 2,700 kDa, with exceptional activities of up to 4.03 &#215; 106 g mol&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. A relatively large&#8208;scale synthesis (30&#8211;50 g) of UHMW ethylene/acrylate copolymers was notably achieved. The properties of these UHMW ethylene/acrylate copolymers were comprehensively evaluated, demonstrating that these copolymers retained the bulk properties of ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) while exhibiting improved surface and dyeing properties. Particularly, the tensile strength of the ethylene/acrylate copolymers significantly increased with higher molecular weights, reaching 44 MPa (147 MPa after a pre&#8208;drawing ratio of 3.1), which is comparable to that of UHMWPE.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronegative Strategic Positions in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Unlocking High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold (Au) concentrations accumulated from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and industrial leachates far surpass those found in natural ores, a highly valuable resource if efficient recovery methods can be developed. Despite advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), achieving adsorbents with high selectivity, large capacity, and rapid adsorption kinetics remain challenging because of limitations in partial pore wall sites. Here, we present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs (HATP&#8208;COFs) with an electronegative skeleton, specifically designed for selective Au recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers within the COFs introduce electron&#8208;rich sites that extend across strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the overall structural integrity. These features facilitate efficient Au capture through electrostatic interactions, achieving an exceptional adsorption capacity exceeding 2366 mg g&#8722;1 with rapid kinetics, making HATP&#8208;COFs one of the most efficient pure COFs reported to date. Moreover, these HATP&#8208;COFs demonstrate remarkable selectivity, stability, and scalability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronegative skeleton introduces critical binding sites, promoting strong electrostatic interactions with Au3+ ions and improving adsorption kinetics. This work highlights the potential of charge&#8208;interface engineering in COFs as a transformative strategy for developing next&#8208;generation materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Screening of Siloxane Molecules as Electrolyte Additive for High&#8208;Temperature Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but face significant challenges at extreme temperatures. Especially at high temperatures, side reactions and electrode dissolution are exacerbated by repeated cycling. It is therefore essential to optimize the electrolyte formulation. Here, a series of siloxane molecules are screened to boost the high&#8208;temperature performance of anode materials in SIBs. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening prefers to interact with anions, resulting in reduced P&#8208;F bonding and the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. This association also raises the oxidation potential and improves the Na&#8208;ion transfer. Additionally, MDM inhibits the hydrolysis of PF6&#713;, reducing the deleterious species in the electrolyte. Therefore, commercial Sn microparticles show a reversible capacity of 752 mAh g&#8208;1 at 60 oC after 750 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, much better than the case without MDM. This result exceeds the reported data at high temperatures. MDM as an electrolyte additive also improves the high&#8208;temperature performance of Bi and hard carbon. These results provide useful guidance for the rational selection of electrolyte additives for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a strategy of selectively breaking the C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds using commercially available low&#8208;cost Lewis acid (LA) and reconstructing the broken C(sp3)&#8208;N bonds with NaOH to high&#8208;efficiently and fully recycle EPs waste into high&#8208;value platform chemicals firstly, that is bisphenol A (BPA) and 4,4'&#8208;methylenebis (N, N'&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80). The yield of BPA is 93% wt. with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt.% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100 % recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Due to its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and byproducts, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridyl organoboron reagents has been developed. The merger of the reagents with a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling condition enables a robust and efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.







Abstract
The stability of 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents is a long&#8208;standing issue in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry due to hydrolysis. However, as the use of pyridine&#8208;based pharmaceuticals continues to increase, there is a high demand for stable and reactive 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents. Herein, a general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents has been developed. The application of the water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents in a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling with a halide scavenger enables an efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Allows Control of Remote Stereochemistry in Asymmetric Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral ligand and a racemic keto&#8208;alcohol starting material allows a hydrogen borrowing cyclisation reaction to form products with both high yields and high enantioselectivity. The excellent yields and enantiomeric purities of the products formed from a racemic starting material are indicative of a dynamic kinetic resolution process involving a base labile cyclohexene intermediate. Finally, the cyclic products can be easily manipulated to a wide range of enantiopure acyl cyclohexanes.







Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;substituted ketones via hydrogen borrowing alkylation of both racemic linear precursors and 1,5&#8208;diols is described. The base mediated racemization of an intermediate cyclohexenone to facilitates a dynamic kinetic resolution, affording highly enantioenriched cyclohexanes in excellent yields, which could be further functionalized by removal of the Ph* group. DFT modelling revealed the mode of enantioinduction to be a stepwise process comprising of a hydride transfer and a coordination change to a &#960;&#8208;allylic enolate complex with the iridium catalyst.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208; and Quarterpyridine&#8208;Based Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>

Terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based vinylene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs are synthesized, which exhibit considerably high light&#8208;visible catalytic efficiency with the H2O2 production rate (HPR) is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water and O2 atmosphere. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The revealed structure&#8211;property relationship presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
This paper presents multipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely defined position and number of pyridinium cationic groups. Specifically, three terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based trialdehydes were synthesized, and utilized as the starting monomers to polymerize with trimethylpyridinium bromide to yield vinylene&#8208;linked iTPy&#8208;COF, iTPPy&#8208;COF and iQPPy&#8208;COF, respectively. Thus constructed donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs exhibit considerably high light&#8208;visible catalytic efficiency for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis by the dual&#8208;channel mechanisms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). In pure water and O2 atmosphere, the H2O2 production rate (HPR) of iTPPy&#8208;COF after 1&#8197;h reaction is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Moreover, it is found that changing the arm lengths and ratios of pyridine to benzene ring in the frameworks significantly affects the photocatalytic capability. The structure&#8211;property relationship is investigated in terms of the variations of electronic structures through the theoretical simulations and measurements of photophysical parameters such as fluorescence lifetimes, photocurrent intensities, and impedances of charge transfer, which presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Controlled Internal Electric Field in MOF/COF Heterojunction Towards Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently connected NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti)/TpBpy&#8208;COF heterojunction with a strong internal electric field was constructed to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting performance. The results show that the co&#8208;exposure of the (001) and (111) crystal faces in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) forms the strongest internal electric field with TpBpy&#8208;COF, promoting the effective separation of photogenerated charges in the S&#8208;scheme path.







Abstract
Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H2 and O2 evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF&#8208;based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S&#8208;scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two isoindigo&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG) were synthesized using a microwave&#8208;assisted method. By modulating core planarity, distinct morphological variations were achieved, with the highly crystalline, planar sheet&#8208;like I&#8208;TTA material standing out. This material exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting (OER and HER) reactions with low overpotential and promotes the potential of COFs in sustainable energy applications.







Abstract
Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG (I=Isoindigo, TTA=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)&#8208;trianiline, TG=triamino&#8208;guanidinium hydrochloride salt). By introducing two amine core units with different planarity, such as triazine and ionic guanidinium units, we control the morphology, crystallinity, and corresponding electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar two dimensional (2D) nanosheets covalent organic framework (COF), I&#8208;TTA whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (COP), I&#8208;TG with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134&#8197;mV for HER (in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4) and ~283&#8197;mV for OER (in 1&#8197;M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24&#8197;hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

         <title>3D Cluster&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COFs, utilizing multicore Cu clusters with specific stereochemical configurations as building blocks, were first synthesized through a stepwise assembly strategy. In comparison to isolated Cu4 clusters, the well&#8208;ordered porous framework structure of Cu4COFs exhibits a narrower band gap, enhanced structural integrity, and more efficient charge transfer characteristics. These features endow Cu4COFs with greatly enhanced performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Copper clusters exhibit superior catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and their defined structures endow them with unique advantages for modeling the catalytic mechanism at the atomic level. Additionally, the construction of highly stable and regularly structured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on copper clusters still presents significant challenges. Herein, we reported two highly stable and reactive cluster&#8208;based COFs (termed Cu4COF&#8208;1 and Cu4COF&#8208;2) constructed via a stepwise assembly strategy. The epitaxially amino&#8208;modified Cu4 cluster (Cu4&#8208;NH2) was initially synthesized based on coordination bonds. Then, Cu4COFs were obtained by the covalent linkage of Cu4&#8208;NH2 clusters and organic linkers. Compared with isolated Cu4 clusters, the Cu4COFs exhibit greater stability, a narrower band gap, a larger specific surface area, and better charge transfer ability, which endow them with superior photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the covalently linked Cu4COFs could efficiently lower the energy barrier for the formation of the critical *COOH intermediate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This study offers a solid basis for the atomically precise construction of novel metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COF catalysts.

Compared with isolated Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; clusters, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;COFs exhibit greater stability, a narrower band gap, a larger specific surface area, and better charge transfer ability, which endow them with superior photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance under visible light. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the covalently linked Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;COFs could efficiently lower the energy barrier for the formation of the critical *COOH intermediate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This study offers a solid basis for the atomically precise construction of novel metal-cluster-based COF catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates is presented using a transition metal&#8208;free route through a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization on gram scale. Terephthalates were readily converted into aromatic diisocyanates in flow and used to synthesize 100&#8201;% renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.







Abstract
Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum&#8208;derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D&#8208;galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram&#8208;scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram&#8208;scale preparation of 1,4&#8208;phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5&#8208;toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high&#8208;pressure gases or costly transition&#8208;metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.

         <title>Expanding Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam (PoTeM) Core Structure Diversity by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis and Bioengineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) derive from ornithine&#8208;based lysobacterene A. To expand the PoTeM core structure carbon skeleton by a CH2&#8208;unit, a synthetic access to lysobacterene A and an extended analog was developed, and cyclization by cognate ikarugamycin cyclases IkaBC was achieved in vitro. Building on these results, the adenylation domain of the NRPS IkaA was programmed to directly incorporate l&#8208;lysine, giving biotechnological access to the first backbone&#8208;engineered PoTeM, homo&#8208;ikarugamycin.







Abstract
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) represent a growing class of bioactive natural products that are derived from a common tetramate polyene precursor, lysobacterene A, produced by an unusual bacterial iterative polyketide synthase (PKS)/non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway&#8208;specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton do currently not exist. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural l&#8208;ornithine&#8208;derived building block by l&#8208;lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo&#8208;ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept l&#8208;lysine, which upon co&#8208;expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo&#8208;ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically&#8208;Stretchable Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Electron Acceptors with Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By novel molecular design, a dimerized acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) was synthesized. DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based rigid devices render an efficiency of 18.75&#8201;% and crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. A polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL) was prepared via polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. Compared to DY&#8208;FBrL, PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based rigid devices display a higher COS of 23.45&#8201;% but a lower efficiency of 14.13&#8201;%. Importantly, intrinsically&#8208;stretchable devices based on DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL exhibit excellent device stretchability.







Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are emerging as promising candidates for powering next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, developing molecular design strategies to achieve both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach by synthesizing a dimerized electron acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) that enables rigid OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.75&#8201;% and a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. The enhanced PCE and stretchability of DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based devices are attributed to its extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and elongated side chains. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL), synthesized via the polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. While PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices exhibit a slightly lower PCE of 14.13&#8201;%, they achieve a significantly higher COS of 23.45&#8201;%, representing one of the highest PCEs reported for polymerized acceptors containing only flexible linkers. Consequently, IS&#8208;OSCs fabricated using DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL achieve notable PCEs of 14.31&#8201;% and 11.61&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, the device stretchability improves progressively from Y6 (strain at PCE80%=11&#8201;%), to DY&#8208;FBrL (strain at PCE80%=23&#8201;%), and PDY&#8208;FL (strain at PCE80%=31&#8201;%). This study presents a promising molecular design strategy for tailoring electron acceptor structures, offering a new pathway to develop high&#8208;performance IS&#8208;OSCs with enhanced mechanical properties.

         <title>All&#8208;alkynyl Protected Rod&#8208;Shaped Au9(AgCu)126 Nanocluster with Remarkable Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of large&#8208;size alloy nanoclusters (~2 nm) is still challenging. An all&#8208;alkynyl protected [Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#8801;C)68(BF4)]4+ (x=0 ~ 20) (1) trimetallic nanocluster has been synthesized and structure determined by SCXRD. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28 protected by 68 PhC&#8801;C ligands with 15 distinct alkynyl&#8211;metal binding configurations. Theoretic calculation reveals that the 1 features a HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 0.29 eV. This suggests that 1 is situated at the boundary of the transition from a molecular to a metallic state. Remarkably, compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibit significantly enhanced photothermal conversion capability. A substantial temperature rise of ~ 51.5 &#176;C within 5 min (&#955;ex = 660 nm, 0.5 W/cm2) and a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 84.7% at 12 &#956;M in N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were observed.Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption(TA)&#160;spectroscopy reveals that the electron&#8208;phonon coupling&#160;(&#964;e&#8208;ph) of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1, when employed as a photothermal material, shows promise in biothermal therapy, photothermal catalysis, and photothermal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Force Spectroscopy Uncovers Root Zone&#8208; and Bacteria&#8208;Specific Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding root&#8208;bacteria interactions with plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is key to developing effective biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture. We performed single&#8208;cell force spectroscopy using the atomic force microscope (AFM) to study the primary attachment of two PGPR, Bacillus velezensis and Pseudomonas defensor, to different regions of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Force measurements with individual cells uncovered distinct attachment strategies by each strain, involving binding via micrometer&#8208;long polymers from both bacteria and root surfaces. Flagella differentially affected the binding interactions of each PGPR; their removal altered binding characteristics differently for each strain, highlighting the importance of surface polymeric molecules in early root colonization. Using silica beads to mimic the negatively charged bacteria, we demonstrated the influence of electrostatic forces on root&#8208;bacteria interactions. We examined interactions with abiotic surfaces of varying surface energies, revealing the roles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces in initial binding. Our measurements show that differences in physico&#8208;chemical properties of bacteria and roots are responsible for variations in primary attachment strategies between PGPR strains and root regions. Parallel fluorescence measurements corroborated our AFM single&#8208;cell analysis. Overall, our results provide a nanoscale view of bacterial attachment to roots, offering key insights into how beneficial bacteria colonize roots, crucial for enhancing biofertilizer effectiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Sensitized Activation of Lophyl Radicals by Heptamethine Cyanines Enables Dry Film Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The near&#8208;infrared&#160;(NIR)&#160;sensitized generation of lophyl radicals (L&#8729;) by heptamethine cyanine led to initiation of radical photopolymerization of multi&#8208;functional acrylates when different hexaarylbisimidazoles (HABIs) and N&#8208;phenylglycine (NPG) operated coinitiator. The latter functioned as donor. For a deeper understanding, heptamethine cyanines were used following a photoinduced electron transfer&#160;(PET).&#160;HABI&#160;derivatives with electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents demonstrated that those with electron acceptors resulted in a higher photopolymerization efficiency of multifunctional acrylates. Tri&#8208;(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA) and tri&#8208;methylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA)&#160;served as the monomers.&#160;Sensitizers (Sens) exposed with a high intense NIR&#8208;light source at 808 nm exhibiting a positive charge in the cyanine pattern significantly operate more efficient for radical photopolymerization than a&#160;Sens&#160;without a positive charge. Differences in efficiency of&#160;PET&#160;can give an&#160;&#160;explanation for these differences.&#160;&#160; The heat generated by the cyanine's internal conversion from S1&#160;to S0&#160;additionally influenced the slightly endothermic reaction between&#160;L&#8729; and&#160;NPG.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Bond Functionalization of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;typical C&#8208;functionalized sugars represent a prominent yet hardly accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. The available synthetic methodologies towards such sugar derivatives suffer either from an extensive use of protecting groups, requiring long and laborious synthetic manipulations, or from limited predictability and non&#8208;controllable site&#8208;selectivity of the employed C&#8208;functionalization reactions. In this work, we disclose an alternative synthetic methodology towards non&#8208;typical sugars that allows facile, site&#8208;selective, and stereocontrolled C&#8208;functionalization of sugars through a traceless tethering approach. The described silyl&#8208;based redox&#8208;active tethering group appends directly to the unprotected sugar substrate and mediates the C&#8208;functionalization reaction through a photochemically&#8208;promoted 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, while transforming into a readily&#8208;removable silyl protecting group. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrate substrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant C&#8208;functionalized carbohydrate conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)&#8208;Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>

In&#160;the reaction with CO, cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] with CO2 led to insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#8210;C bonds and all Mg&#8210;N bonds, yielding&#160; magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C4H4)]. The reactions can be viewed as the &#8220;masked&#8208;magnesium(I)&#8221; induced cross&#8208;coupling of ethene with either CO or CO2, to give more complex organic products. Reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#8210;N bonds of the magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this dissociates to monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2.

Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate&#160;gave formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2] gave trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;CO2)Mg}(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into one Mg&#8210;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;, Au(II)&#8208;, Au(III)&#8208;Fluoride Complexes: Synthesis and Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III) are summarised. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several developments of these complexes with a range of supporting ligands, which has enabled their reactivity to be studied. Herein, these advances are highlighted, organised by the oxidation state of Au and supporting ligand.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III), up to and including 2024, are reviewed herein. Despite the flourishing field of gold catalysis, these complexes had long been elusive due to their instability. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several reports of these complexes in recent years. The use of a variety of supporting ligands have facilitated access to these complexes, which has allowed their reactivity to be further studied and understood, thereby laying the ground for future reaction development. This review highlights these advances, organised by the formal oxidation state of the gold centre and the supporting ligand.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with high stability at elevated temperatures were assembled using fluorine&#8208;graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvent. At temperature of 80&#8201;&#176;C, the batteries could operate at high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 and stably run for 240 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1, the corresponding pouch cell showed high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries demonstrate promising prospects in terms of high&#8208;density energy storage and efficient CO2 fixation. However, their practical application is impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics and leakage of volatile and flammable organic electrolytes, especially for high temperature application scenarios, leading to large polarization and limited cycling stability. Herein, we fabricate a highly rechargeable and stable Li&#8208;CO2 battery with high temperature adaptability by employing fluorine&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvents. The employed FGDY, which possesses homogeneous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon, high specific surface area, and uniform pores, significantly enhances the battery reaction kinetics. Consequently, the fabricated Li&#8208;CO2 batteries operate consistently at a large current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C while showcasing high discharge capacity of 29050&#8197;mAh&#8901;g&#8722;1 along with excellent cycling stability. As proof of concept, Li&#8208;CO2 pouch cells achieve a high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the device, and show outstanding cycling stability at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This study underscores the effectiveness of graphdiyne&#8208;derived carbon catalysts in achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Novel Low&#8208;Cytotoxic and Highly Efficient Type I Photoinitiators for Visible LED&#8208;/Sunlight&#8208;Induced Photopolymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops new photoinitiators (PIs) for photopolymerization, combining high efficiency, low toxicity, and compatibility with 3D printing. The C5 compound, designed via molecular modeling, outperforms commercial PIs, improving initiation by 40&#8211;132&#8201;% under LED and sunlight. Its efficiency, photochemical mechanism, and low toxicity are experimentally confirmed.







Abstract
The development of photoinitiators (PIs) combining high initiation ability, low&#8208;toxicity, and availability for high&#8208;precision 3D printing is a key challenge and an urgent problem to be solved nowadays in photopolymerization. In this study, carbazole chalcone glyoxylate oxime ester derivatives (denoted as Cs, C1&#8722;C5) containing both glyoxylate and oxime ester moieties with good light absorption properties in the visible range have been designed as type I PIs for the free radical photopolymerization (FRP) of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) under 405&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) as well as sunlight irradiation. The reaction properties and mechanism of Cs are firstly predicted by molecular modeling/molecular design, which anticipate that C5 could exhibit the best photoinitiation ability, this structure being more prone to decarboxylation. Subsequent experimental results clearly show that the photoinitiation ability of C5 outperforms that of the benchmark commercial PIs (methyl benzoylformate (MBF), diphenyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO)), and phenylbis (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;phosphine oxide (BAPO) under the same conditions. Compared to TPO, the photoinitiation ability of C5 improved by 40&#8201;%, 132&#8201;%, and 47&#8201;% exposed to LED@405&#8197;nm, LED@450&#8197;nm, and sunlight. In addition, C5 is successfully applied to 3D printing for the manufacture of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution object. The photochemical mechanism of C5 is systematically and comprehensively analyzed using a combination of steady state photolysis, decarboxylation reaction, fluorescence experiments, and electron spin resonance&#8208;spin trapping (ESR&#8208;ST) technology. It is found that both glyoxylate and oxime ester in C5 are highly active and capable of undergoing decarboxylation reactions to produce CO2 and free radicals, which is consistent with the results predicted by molecular modeling. Furthermore, the low&#8208;toxicity of C5 is evidenced by cytotoxicity assays. The comprehensive molecular modeling and experimental approach adopted in this research has led to the development of novel PIs that are highly efficient and low&#8208;toxic, and can be used for high&#8208;precision 3D printing, which offers broad application prospects in the fields of environmental sustainability, visible light curing, and biomedical science.

         <title>Copper(I) Halide Complex Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Aggregate Induced Emission for Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) halide complex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging performance, which is resulted from the joint effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption of the heavy Cu2I2 core, high exciton utilization efficiency facilitated by the fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and the effective suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions in solid state.







Abstract
Developing solution&#8208;processable and stable scintillators with high light yields, low detection limits and high imaging resolutions holds great significance for flexible X&#8208;ray imaging. However, attaining an optimal equilibrium among X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, exciton utilization efficiency, and decay lifetime of scintillators remains a substantial challenge. Here, a new Cu(I) halide complex was synthesized in a mild condition. It exhibits intense blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic, as well as good water&#8208;oxygen stability and photochemical stability. Notably, the complex shows excellent radiation resistance and efficient radioluminescence (RL) with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 42.5&#8197;nGyairs&#8722;1. This superior scintillation performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption by the heavy Cu2I2 core, the high radiation&#8208;induced exciton utilization rate in TADF process, and the remarkable suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions by the restriction of intramolecular motions in solid state. Furthermore, the favourable solution processability of the complex facilitates the successful fabrication of a flexible film, achieving high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with a resolution of 17.3&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of hybrid Cu(I) halides with AIE&#8208;TADF effects for high&#8208;energy radiation detection and imaging, opening up new avenues for the exploration of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalysts Derived from Water&#8208;Induced Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Aerogel for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast transformation process and underlying formation mechanism of water&#8208;induced pure metal&#8211;organic framework aerogels are demonstrated. The derived edge&#8208;enriched oxygen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nickel sites anchored on the defective carbon belts (a&#8208;Ni/DCBs) display excellent catalytic activity and durability toward electrochemical water oxidation, resulting from the optimized electronic structure and reduced thermodynamic energy barrier.







Abstract
Research on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) aerogels is relatively scarce, primarily constrained by the limited availability of synthetic methods. Herein, a water&#8208;induced rapid conversion process of MOF powder to MOF aerogel is demonstrated, where the macroscopic transition is essentially due to the reassembly of microscopic constituent units and the rapid alteration of morphological structure. The derived catalyst possesses abundant holes left by the acid leaching process, leading to the high enrichment of O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites on the concomitant carbon edges. Consequently, such a catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, only requiring a low overpotential of 279&#8197;mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the reduced OER energy barrier over the edge&#8208;enriched O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites, as compared with internal O&#8208;coordinated sites and traditional N&#8208;coordinated sites. This is primarily attributed to the optimization effect of distinctive O&#8208;coordinated structure and synergistic edge effect on the electronic structure of active Ni centers.

         <title>Direct CO2 Activation and Conversion to Ethanol via Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to activate and convert CO2 in dissolved as well as gaseous form via reactive oxygen species was established. Within only 5&#8197;h reaction time at atmospheric conditions, room temperature a conversion efficiency of 92&#8201;% from CO2 to 12.2&#8197;mmol/L ethanol was achieved. Direct Air Capture experiments gave similar results, which showcases both the inherent flexibility of this method as well as its efficiency.







Abstract
The growing demand for energy and the excessive use of fossil fuels represents one of the main challenges for humanity. Storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuels or value&#8208;added chemicals without creating additional environmental burdens is a key requirement for a sustainable future. Here we use biomimetic artificial photosynthesis and present a dPCN&#8208;224(H) MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic system, which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate and convert CO2 to ethanol under atmospheric conditions, at room temperature and in 2&#8211;5&#8197;h reaction time. The system provides a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion efficiency (CTE) of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, this method also allows the conversion of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC), making it a rapid and versatile method for both dissolved and gaseous CO2.

         <title>Chemical Energy Lights Up Europium&#8208;Based Ultra&#8208;bright Afterglow for Bioanalysis Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photochemical afterglow system was constructed through structural design and coordination, lighting up the weak&#8208;emissive fluorophore in the form of afterglow through chemiexcitation. Ultimately, a system with a highest reported afterglow luminescence QY of 27.5&#8201;% was accomplished and successfully applied in high SBR in vivo bioimaging and highly sensitive in vitro diagnostic of SAA through lateral flow immunoassay. Ab: antibody; AG: afterglow; PS: polystyrene; QY: quantum yield; SBR: signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio; SAA: serum amyloid A.







Abstract
Photochemical afterglow materials are gaining great attention for the property to continuously emit light after the excitation source is removed. However, their limited luminescence quantum yield (QY) and brightness hinder the use in biological applications. In this study, we introduce a novel photochemical afterglow system that combines a newly designed photoenergy cache unit (PCU) with an emitter through coordination covalent bonds. The PCU boasts a dark state to significantly emit photons only through chemiexcitation in the process of photochemical reactions, facilitating direct energy transfer to the emitter and resulting in bright afterglow. The related mechanisms further guided us to achieve the highest reported afterglow luminescence quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;%. The system can be encapsulated and dispersed in aqueous solutions for in vivo bioimaging in living mice under mild and simple conditions (low concentration, low excitation power, short excitation time, short exposure time), and also for in vitro diagnostic through lateral flow immunoassay, enabling the highly sensitive detection of the inflammatory biomarker serum amyloid A (SAA) and demonstrating excellent correlation with clinical test results. This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such systems for further biomedical applications.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Mn2+&#8208;Based Scintillation Screens for X&#8208;Ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview introduces the scintillation mechanism and synthesis methods of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) scintillators, and emphatically summarizes the research progress in fabrication strategies of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging.







Abstract
Scintillators play a pivotal role in multiple fields such as medical imaging, radioactive contaminant detection, non&#8208;destructive testing, high&#8208;energy physics and homeland security. However, the traditional inorganic scintillators are faced with the shortcomings of high fabrication cost and low light yield. In recent years, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have become the promising alternatives for their excellent luminescence properties, favorable air and irradiation stability, and low&#8208;cost preparation. Among them, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) have attracted wide attention due to their particular flexible molecular structure design, easy synthesis and low toxicity. This minireview summarizes the latest progress in high performance Mn2+&#8208;Based scintillation screens. Herein, the scintillation mechanism of OIMnHs scintillators is firstly discussed. Then, the different synthesis methods of OIMnHs scintillators are briefly described, including solvent diffusion, cooling crystallization, evaporative crystallization and solid&#8208;state mechanochemical synthesis. After that, the recent strategies of OIMnHs for forming scintillation screens applying to X&#8208;ray imaging are emphatically reviewed, which are growing large single crystals, fabricating to glass or ceramic and blending with polymers. The fabrication progress and applications of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens were introduced and the structure&#8211;property relationship of these screens was discussed. Finally, the challenges of this new scintillator material are summarized, and the potential research directions for future exploration are proposed.

         <title>Robust Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles via Ethynyl Bonding for High&#8208;Fidelity Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, rapid and user&#8208;friendly strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates via stable Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bonds was developed, which showed better resistance to biothiols than Au&#8722;S conjugates, enhancing detection signal fidelity and reliability in cell imaging, especially in complex physiological environments. This strategy addresses the longstanding issue of stability towards biothiols, thereby making it a valuable tool for a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
While Au&#8722;S bonds have been widely applied in preparing gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugates for biosensing, cell imaging, and biomedical research, biothiols in complex biological environments can seriously interfere with the stability of the conjugates due to ligand exchange. Herein, we communicate a robust and fast strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates (PFCs) using the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, which can be completed within two minutes. The resulting Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs exhibited better stability and resistance to biothiols than the corresponding Au&#8722;S PFCs, and also demonstrated excellent stability in high salt concentration, a wide range of pH values, and varying temperatures. The mechanism of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C conjugation was confirmed using molecular dynamics simulation and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs significantly improved the signal fidelity in an intracellular caspase imaging assay. Overall, the developed strategy provides a promising approach for constructing AuNP nanoprobes, allowing reliable detection and broadening the potential for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Direct Observation of Electron Donation onto the Reactants and a Transient Poisoning Mechanism During CO2 Electroreduction on Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ techniques reveal key insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Ni single atom catalysts. Through poisoning studies, we reveal that the reduction of the system does not result in a metal&#8208;based reduction, rather it is associated with donation of electrons onto a combination of the support and the reactants. We demonstrate the suitability of these catalysts for application to CO2 waste streams which have unavoidable impurities.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are an important class of materials that mediate chemical reduction reactions, a key subset of which is Ni within a carbon support for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, how the metal atom/clusters and the carbon&#8208;based support act in concert to catalyze CO2RR is not well understood, with most reports attributing activity solely to the Ni&#8208;Nx/C moieties. To address this gap, we have undertaken a mechanistic investigation, employing in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with electrochemical studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to further understand how Ni single atoms work in conjunction with the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix to promote CO2RR to CO, and how the presence of impurities such as those present in CO2&#8208;containing waste flue gases (including NOx, and CN&#8722;) changes the catalyst upon reduction. In contrast to previous works, we do not find strong evidence for a purely metal&#8208;based reduction upon application of negative reductive potentials. Instead, we present evidence for an increase in the equatorial vs. axial splitting of Ni, consistent with electrons moving onto the reactants via the Ni single atom 3dz2 orbital. In addition, we demonstrate a transient poisoning mechanism of the Ni SAC by nitrite and thiocyanate, explaining the recovery of activity during CO2RR. These insights can aid the design of practical CO2 valorization technologies.

A dual site catalyst Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C with single Fe atom and Cu NPs on N&#8208;doped carbon to enhance the coupling of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N) for urea synthesis. The Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high FEurea of 50.05&#8201;% with a flow cell at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized.







Abstract
Synthesis of urea through electrocatalytic coupling reaction of CO2 with nitrite (NO2&#8722;) represents a sustainable means to substitute the conventional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthetic protocol. The direct conversion of dilute NO2&#8722; in real wastewaters to urea with high efficiency is still a significant challenge, as C&#8208;intermediates tend to go through an extensive reduction achieving mostly C&#8208;containing productions due to the lack of N&#8208;intermediates, originating from slow diffusion rate of NO2&#8722;. Herein, we report the charge&#8208;polarized Fe&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Cu&#948;+ dual sites in metal/carbon heterojunction material (Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; solution (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N). The electron&#8208;rich single Fe atoms dispersed N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) restrain *CO desorption, and the electron&#8208;deficient Cu nanoparticles (Cu) promote the deep reduction of NO2&#8722; to *NH2. As a result, the obtained Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for urea of 50.05&#8201;% with a yield of 850.57&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in a flow cell. Moreover, Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized. The present results provide a valuable reference for the design of new catalysts for efficient synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds in dilute NO2&#8722; solution.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced Inversion and Amplification of Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) in Supramolecular Assemblies of Axially Chiral Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented control of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated fluorescent enantiomers is achieved through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The naphthalene monoimide (NMI) fluorophores (R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI), each equipped with two pyridyl functionalities, show solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and enhanced chiroptical properties through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Co&#8208;assemblies with chiral diacids (D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids) produce hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical structures, resulting in inversion and amplification of CD and CPL properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly and chiroptical properties of two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminogens, R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI, each equipped with two pyridyl moieties for hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding with chiral diacids. The two enantiomers display aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and increased CD and CPL signals in the self&#8208;assembled state with a high glum value of 1.5 (&#177;0.06)&#215;10&#8722;2 in 1:9 dioxane:methylcyclohexane. Crystallographic analysis confirmed mirror&#8208;image helical structures for R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, leading to elongated hexagonal platelets. Supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of R&#8208;NMI with D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids (D&#8208;TA and L&#8208;TA) could remarkably modulate and invert the chiroptical properties of R&#8208;NMI, which is unachievable with control chiral monoacids. The co&#8208;assembled structures were driven by pyridine&#8208;carboxylic acid H&#8208;bonding as revealed from the crystal structure analysis, which was also supported by computational studies. Strikingly, R&#8208;NMI+D&#8208;TA leads to an exceptionally high fourfold amplification in the glum value [5.4 (&#177;0.04)&#215;10&#8722;2] with an inverted sign, which additionally demonstrates intriguing temperature&#8208;dependent switching. In contrast, R&#8208;NMI+L&#8208;TA results in a threefold reduction in the glum value [0.54 (&#177;0.015)&#215;10&#8722;3], also with an inverted sign compared to R&#8208;NMI alone, establishing a clear strategy for chiral discrimination between the two enantiomers of TA.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Agent for Synergistic Tumor Therapy: Co&#8208;Activation of Photochemical&#8208;Biological Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic composite nanotherapeutic agent (HAP@BMPns) was developed for synergistic tumor therapy. HAP@BMPns is triggered by the acidic tumor environment to release the photosensitizer BMP and Ca2+, thereby synergistically activating photochemical&#8208;biological effects through the production of O2&#8722;&#8901; based Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions and mitochondrial damage caused by Ca2+ overload, ultimately achieving a synergistic effect for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;mode photodynamic therapy (PDT) based on photochemical reactions is limited by the tumor microenvironment, which reduces the ablation efficiency for solid tumors. Making it vital to seek ways to improve the tumor therapeutic effect. Based on this, we propose a dual&#8208;mode intelligent nanotherapeutic system (HAP@BMPns) based on photochemical&#8208;biological effects. HAP@BMPns is composed of an acid&#8208;responsive high&#8208;calcium biomimetic nanomaterial (HAP) and photosensitizer (BMP), which can spontaneously activate photochemical (Type&#8208;I PDT) and biological effects for synergistic cancer therapy. HAP@BMPns breaks down upon entering tumor cells under acidic conditions, releasing a large amount of Ca2+ and BMP. Triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, which induces mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis. Synchronously, Type&#8208;I PDT of BMP under two&#8208;photon (800&#8197;nm) laser irradiation becomes activated, resulting in enhanced destruction of tumor cells by the photochemical effect. Cell studies have indicated that HAP@BMPns (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) exhibits a strong inhibitory efficiency on tumor cells growth, with low (22.4&#8201;%) survival rate. However, the individual components, i.&#8201;e. BMP (5.0&#8197;&#956;M) and HAP (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) display low inhibitory efficiency with high survival rates (55.9&#8201;% and 63.0&#8201;% respectively). Therefore, this dual&#8208;mode synergistic treatment strategy using acid&#8208;triggered photochemical&#8208;biological effects significantly enhances the ablation of solid tumors, realizing the synergistic effect. We hope that this design strategy can provide guidance for the design and development of a tumor therapeutic platform.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Spillover Promotes Stable Synthesis of Vinyl Chloride on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric O/N co&#8208;doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized by a sequential oxygen etching strategy to overcome the over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during acetylene hydrochlorination. This single&#8208;atom Ru thus induced an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover based on the electrostatic potential difference, which resulted in enhanced kinetics to proceed the reaction via Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier.







Abstract
Ru single&#8208;atom catalysts hold great promise for the robust synthesis of vinyl chloride through acetylene hydrochlorination. However, the easy over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during reaction suppress the catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we have synthesized an oxygen doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst by a sequential oxygen etching strategy, which delivers the remarkable yield of vinyl chloride monomer (&gt;99.38&#8201;%) and stability (&gt;900&#8197;h, 180&#8197;h&#8722;1), far beyond those reported Ru counterparts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric structure of single&#8208;atom Ru promotes an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover after the activation of hydrogen chloride, which enables the reaction to proceed through Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier of acetylene hydrochlorination compared to the traditional Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway. As a result, the enhanced reaction kinetics further restrict over&#8208;chlorination of single&#8208;atom Ru, thereby ensuring the excellent durability. This work offers a strategy for designing multifunctional catalysts with enhanced performances for acetylene hydrochlorination.

         <title>Broadband&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition and Thermoinduced Cycloreversion&#8208;Powered Dynamic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion of pyrenylvinylpyrylium salt elicit bending of its crystals by exposure to visible light and straightening by heating. This example represents a novel concept of energy conversion where the energy stored in the bonds of the strained cyclobutane ring is converted to work of dynamic molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanically responsive dynamic molecular crystals are central to developing efficient, rapid, and robust materials capable of conversion of light energy to mechanical work. However, unlike some other, mainly photochromic molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems, solids that undergo photoinduced [2+2] cycloaddition have not been thoroughly explored for powering reversible actuation, despite that this reaction system carries potential in the heavily strained bonds of the cyclobutane ring. In this study, we propose that broadband&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition can be used to store energy and actuate dynamic organic crystals by irradiation with visible light. The prototypical material, pyrenylvinylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (1&#8211;PVPyL), undergoes a topochemical [2+2] cycloaddition induced not only by ultraviolet radiation (365&#8197;nm) but also by monochromatic green light (532&#8197;nm), red light (620&#8197;nm) and broadband visible light in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) manner, causing its crystals to bend. The crystals effectively act as energy depots, where the reverse deformation can be initiated by heating and the stored energy is released via thermal cycloreversion reaction. Given the ubiquity of the [2+2] cycloaddition in the solid state, the current study invites the development of new dimeric MOST architectures that utilize sunlight for energy storage and thermal triggers for energy release. Within a broader scope, this approach provides a platform for fabrication of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven crystal actuators capable of harnessing sunlight.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area, Ultra&#8208;thin Organic Films with Both Photochromic and Phosphorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doped materials used the most common plastic polymers (terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride) as hosts exhibited visible photochromic and room temperature phosphorescence phenomena simultaneously. A large&#8208;scale industrial&#8208;grade film that exhibited excellent photostability was successfully fabricated, enabling direct application.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most commonly used polymers in plastic products. Therefore, endowing these polymers with unique optical properties would significantly enhance their overall technological value. Herein, we synthesized a phosphorescent molecule, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuran (DBF), with notable reversible photochromic properties (switching between colorless and deep red) as the guest and constructed a doped system with the above polymers as the hosts. All doped materials exhibited both room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and reversible photochromic properties. The guest molecule exhibited strong reversible cyclization activity and small conformational changes during the reaction process, as well as moderate rigidity of the host matrix, which enabled the uncommon coexistence of these two properties in the doped system. Finally, DBF/PET was successfully formed into a transparent and uniform film with a length of 200&#8197;m, a width of 20&#8197;cm, a thickness of only 60&#8211;70&#8197;&#956;m. This film exhibited excellent thermal&#8208;stability, sensitivity, and resistance to photo&#8208;fatigue, indicating its applicability in industrial production.

         <title>A Hollowed&#8208;Out Heterometallic Cluster for Catalytic Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural lanthanide&#8208;nickel clusters Ln132Ni78 (Ln=Gd, Eu) were synthesized by the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ln3+ and Ni2+ in the presence of iminodiacetate. Both clusters feature a hollow truncated tetrahedral structure with trumpet&#8208;shaped passageways that connect the exterior and the interior of the cluster cage. The solution&#8208;stable cluster has been shown to catalyze size&#8208;selective Knoevenagel condensation and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;containing clusters are synthetically challenging and with significant chemical and materials applications. Herein, two isostructural heterometallic clusters of the formula (NO3)12@[Ln132Ni78(OH)292(IDA)48(CH3COO)96(NO3)12(H2O)78]Cl44&#8901;xH2O&#8901;yCH3OH (IDA=iminodiacetate; Ln=Gd 1, x=110, y=0; Ln=Eu 2, x=95, y=40) were obtained via co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ln3+ (Gd3+ or Eu3+) and Ni2+ in the presence of iminodiacetate (IDA). Crystallographic studies show that each features a truncated tetrahedral core of Ln132Ni78 within which a void of 1.1&#8197;nm in diameter; connecting the central cage and its exterior are four trumpet&#8208;like passageways surface&#8208;decorated with dinuclear units of [Gd(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2Gd]. Mass spectroscopic analyses indicate that both clusters maintained their structural integrity in aqueous solution, with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy providing the most convincing visual evidence in support of the cluster&#8216;s solution stability. Size&#8208;selective Knoevenagel condensation, believed to occur in the passageways on the basis of experimental and molecular modeling results, was achieved in the presence of 1. The application of 1 as a uniquely structured molecular reactor and a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst was further illustrated by the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically significant 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

         <title>Unlocking HFIP for Fluoroalkylation with Molecular Photoelectrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Organofluorine compounds bearing the hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate fluoroalkylation reagents. Herein we report a molecular photoelectrocatalysis method for the C&#8722;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent.







Abstract
Despite the increasing interest in radical&#8208;based fluoroalkylation techniques, the organofluorine compounds bearing the partially fluorinated hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate reagents. Herein we report an unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic method for the C&#8722;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing the readily available hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent. In this process, HFIP is converted into hexafluoroisopropyl radicals, enabling fluoroalkylation reactions. This study broadens the potential applications of molecular photoelectrocatalysis, highlighting its capacity to enable transformations that are difficult to accomplish through traditional electrochemical or photochemical approaches.

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>

Thermoplastic elastomers: Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene, ethylene butadiene rubber and highly crystalline polyethylene segments are prepared using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization. They display low&#8208;viscosity above the melting point of PE and high elastic performances upon crystallization of PE segments.







Abstract
Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt;150&#8201;&#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions on Functionalized Porous Aromatic Cages for Gold Recovery from Complex Aqueous with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for efficient high&#8208;capacity gold recovery. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner. The theoretical calculations and dedicated experiments suggest that anion&#8208;&#960; interactions between the [AuCl4]&#8722; and TFP fractions on T&#8208;PAC cooperated with S/N boning and redox effects play the decisive role for the highly efficient gold&#8208;recovery performance.







Abstract
High capacity, selective recovery and separation of precious metals from complex aqueous solutions is essential but remains a challenge in practical applications. Here, we prepared a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for precise recognition and recovery of gold. T&#8208;PAC exhibits an outstanding gold uptake capacity of up to 2260&#8197;mg/g with fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption selectivity. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner. The theoretical calculations and dedicated experiments suggest that anion&#8208;&#960; interactions between the [AuCl4]&#8722; and TFP fractions on T&#8208;PAC cooperated with S/N boning and redox effects play the decisive role in the highly efficient gold recovery performance.

         <title>Multiple Structural and Phase Transformations of MOF and Selective Hydrocarbon Gas Separation in its Amorphous, Glass Phase States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiple structure transformation and phase evolution within MOF provide a vivid example showing the diverse MOF dynamic chemistry under both room and high temperature. The generated disordered hierarchical pores in amorphous and glassy MOFs different to the crystalline precursor, contributes to efficient separation of either C2H2/C2H4 or C3H6/C3H8 gases mixture for the first time in breakthrough experiments.







Abstract
The first wide&#8208;view image of multiple structural and phase transformations for MOFs, ranging from crystal state transformations to the extreme limit approaching liquid/glass phase, was presented. The process involves i) an initial crystalline transformation from square&#8208;layer framework [Co2(pybz)2(CH3COO)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (Co2) to a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated and ordered vacancies contained framework [Co(pybz)2(CH3OH)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH (CoM) due to in situ disassemble&#8208;reassemble, ii) thermal induced departure of a pair of cis&#8208;form coordinated methanol in CoM leads to amorphous framework a&#8208;dCoM, iii) glass transition to super&#8208;cooled liquid scl&#8208;dCoM, iv) obtaining MOF glass g&#8208;dCoM upon quenching the super&#8208;cooled liquid, and v) re&#8208;crystallization of super&#8208;cooled liquid generates 6&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia&#8208;net framework [Co(pybz)2]6n (rec&#8208;dCoM) under further heating. The access to glass from CoM, provides a new self&#8208;perturbation strategy to create MOF glasses without melting. The wider pore size distribution in amorphous/glassy MOFs than crystalline precursor achieved the first time selective hydrocarbon gas separation by breakthrough experiments, which bring efficient separation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;99&#8197;C2H2/C2H4 by either a&#8208;dCoM or g&#8208;dCoM and produce polymer grade C2H4 with purity&#8805;99.5&#8201;% after a single adsorption process. Furthermore, the mixture of 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;C3H6/C3H8 can be separated by a&#8208;dCoM.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Controlled Protein Switches: Development and In Vitro and In Vivo Applications</title>

Engineering artificial allosteric protein switches controlled by rare earth elements allows the development of assays, construction of bioelectronic devices, and REE&#8208;controlled microorganisms.







Abstract
Lanthanides, which are part of the rare earth elements group have numerous applications in electronics, medicine and energy storage. However, our ability to extract them is not meeting the rapidly increasing demand. The discovery of the bacterial periplasmic lanthanide&#8208;binding protein lanmodulin spurred significant interest in developing biotechnological routes for lanthanide detection and extraction. Here we report the construction of &#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;lanmodulin chimeras that function as lanthanide&#8208;controlled enzymatic switches. Optimized switches demonstrated dynamic ranges approaching 3000&#8208;fold and could accurately quantify lanthanide ions in simple colorimetric or electrochemical assays. E.coli cells expressing such chimeras grow on &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics only in the presence of lanthanide ions. The developed lanthanide&#8208;controlled protein switches represent a novel platform for engineering metal&#8208;binding proteins for biosensing and microbial engineering.

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinel oxide, Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen is developed by high&#8208;throughput methods. The lattice oxygen activation is facilitated by Cr oxidation (Cr3+&#8594;Cr6+), accompanied by cation migration from octahedral to tetrahedral sites. This geometric conversion generates oxygen non&#8208;bonding states essential for lattice oxygen oxidation. Oxidized oxygen species are stabilized through dimerization with CrO4 tetrahedra (d0 Cr6+). The oxide demonstrates high activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with outstanding stability for over 170&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6 octahedrons to CrO4 tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non&#8208;bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8722;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Acetylene Layered Hybrid Perovskites in Photovoltaics</title>

We demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based organic spacer cations. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and use them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior performances and enhanced operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptional potential in converting solar energy to electric power in photovoltaics, yet their application is hampered by limited operational stability. This stimulated the development of hybrid layered (two&#8208;dimensional, 2D) halide perovskites based on hydrophobic organic spacers, templating perovskite slabs, as a more stable alternative. However, conventional organic spacer cations are electronically insulating, resulting in charge confinement within the inorganic slabs, thus limiting their functionality. This can be ameliorated by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the spacer cations. We demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating for the first time aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based (4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methylammonium (BMAA) and buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylbis(4,1&#8208;phenylene)dimethylammonium (BDAA) spacers, respectively. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and apply them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior device performances with a power conversion efficiency of up to 23&#8201;% and higher operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced G&#8208;Quartets: Robust Supramolecular Polymers Exhibiting Heating&#8208;Induced Aqueous Phase Transitions Into Gel or Precipitate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) forms robust, thermoset, and redox&#8208;responsive G&#8208;quadruplex (G4.Cu+) supramolecular polymers (SPs) through unique metallophilic interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic forces. Interestingly, these SPs undergo aqueous phase transitions into a hydrogel via slow dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking below the cloud temperature (Tcp) and fast, complete dehydration into a solid precipitate above Tcp, exhibiting LCST behavior.







Abstract
Certain proteins and synthetic covalent polymers experience aqueous phase transitions, driving functional self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we unveil the ability of supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by G4.Cu+ to undergo heating&#8208;induced unexpected aqueous phase transitions. For the first time, guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) formed a highly stable G&#8208;quartet (G4.Cu+)/G&#8208;quadruplex as a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure with temperature tolerance, distinct from the well&#8208;known G4.K+. The G4.Cu+ self&#8208;assembled in water through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, metallophilic and hydrophobic interactions, forming thermally robust SPs. This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger coordination of Cu+ to four carbonyl oxygens of G&#8208;quartet and the presence of Cu+&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Cu+ attractive metallophilic interactions in Cu+&#8208;induced G&#8208;quadruplex, exhibiting a significantly higher interaction energy than K+ as determined computationally. Remarkably, the aqueous SP solution exhibited heating&#8208;induced phase transitions&#8212;forming a hydrogel through dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking of SPs below cloud temperature (Tcp) and a hydrophobic collapse&#8208;induced solid precipitate above Tcp, showcasing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. Notably, this LCST behavior of G4.Cu+ SP originates from biomolecular functionality rather than commonly exploited thermo&#8208;responsive oligoethylene glycols with supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, exploiting the redox reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+, we demonstrated control over the assembly and disassembly of G&#8208;quartets/G&#8208;quadruplex and gelation reversibly.

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>

TOC illustrates an approach to hydrogen release using low&#8208;load Pt on ALD&#8208;TiO2&#8208;modified &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 pellets for the dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), such as methylcyclohexane and hydrogenated biphenyl/diphenylmethane mixture. The cost&#8208;efficient catalytic reactor is crucial for LOHC import scenarios, enabling effective hydrogen storage, release and transport within existing infrastructure.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.

         <title>Optimization of Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemical Probes for the Pseudoknot RNA of the Frameshift Element in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 frameshift element pseudoknot plays a crucial role in viral replication. Using various techniques, especially NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vitro frameshift assays, we have developed and optimized chemical probes that serve as fundamental structures for potential inhibitors targeting viral RNAs.







Abstract
Targeting the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a viable option for antiviral drug development. We explored three ligand binding sites of the core pseudoknot RNA of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 frameshift element. We iteratively optimized ligands, based on improved affinities, targeting these binding sites and report on structural and dynamic properties of the three identified binding sites. Available experimental 3D structures of the pseudoknot element were compared to SAXS and NMR data to validate its dominant folding state in solution. In order to experimentally map in&#8197;silico predicted binding sites, NMR assignments of the majority of nucleobases were achieved by segmental labeling of the pseudoknot RNA and isotope&#8208;filtered NMR experiments at 1.2&#8197;GHz, demonstrating the value of NMR spectroscopy to supplement modelling and docking data. Optimized ligands with enhanced affinity were shown to specifically inhibit frameshifting without affecting 0&#8208;frame translation in cell&#8208;free translation assays, establishing the frameshift element as target for drug&#8208;like ligands of low molecular weight.

         <title>Dynamic, Single&#8208;cell Monitoring of RNA Modifications Response to Viral Infection Using a Genetically Encoded Live&#8208;cell RNA Methylation Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor allowing for dynamically monitoring of RNA m6A modification at single&#8208;cell resolution is reported, and has been used to elucidate the interaction between host&#8208;cell RNA modifications and the infection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants.







Abstract
RNA modifications, such as N6&#8208;methylation of adenosine (m6A), serve as key regulators of cellular behaviors, and are highly dynamic; however, tools for dynamic monitoring of RNA modifications in live cells are lacking. Here, we develop a genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor that can dynamically monitor RNA m6A level at single&#8208;cell resolution. The sensor senses RNA m6A in cells via affinity&#8208;induced cytoplasmic retention using a nuclear location sequence&#8208;fused m6A reader. It allows for simultaneously measure RNA m6A dynamics and viral invasion at single&#8208;cell level. Based on the single&#8208;cell analytical tool, we found that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection enhances host&#8208;cell RNA m6A level, and high&#8208;level RNA m6A modification in host cells, in turn, facilitates viral infection. Particularly, Omicron, a variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, that features as high infection capacity, however, exhibits a reduced facilitation of m6A modification in host cells. In addition, the sensor can estimate viral inhibition via measuring cellular m6A level, that was explored for screening potential antiviral drugs. The methylation sensor can serve for elucidating the interplay between pathogens and host&#8208;cell epigenetics at single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Nanocrystals with Aggregate Anionic Structure Enable Ion Transport Decoupling of Chain Segment Movement in Poly(ethylene oxide) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike classical poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes, single ion conductors, and crystalline polymers, this work discovered a novel ion transport mechanism mediated by PEO3: LiBF4 nanocrystals with aggregate anionic structure, which decouples the movement of PEO segments. The ultra&#8208;thin PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte exhibits balanced ion conductivity, Li+ transference number, and mechanical strength, extending the life of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes are promising for lithium batteries, but Li+ transport in these electrolytes relies on amorphous chain segment movement, leading to low Li+ mobility and poor mechanical strength. Here we propose a novel Li+ transport mechanism mediated by PEO3:LiBF4 nanocrystals (NCPB) with the aggregate (AGG) anionic structure, which enables a change from amorphous to crystalline phase dominated ion transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte. Experiments and simulations reveal that the interaction between Li+ and F in NCPB with AGG anionic structure simultaneously restricts anion transport and reorients anions within the free volume of NCPB, resulting in a three&#8208;coordination intermediate to facilitate Li+ transport. The unique Li+ transport mechanism through NCPB makes the PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte with a high Li+ transference number (0.73) and remarkably increased mechanical strength (storage modulus &gt;100&#8197;MPa) at 45&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, the Li|LiFePO4 batteries with the ultrathin self&#8208;supported PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte (10&#8197;&#956;m) exhibit significantly improved cycle life (97&#8201;% @ 468 cycles) compared to those with PEO/LiTFSI electrolyte (failed @ 68 cycles). This work demonstrates a novel ion transport mechanism for achieving selective and rapid Li+ transport.

A dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex is armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO). Upon pH&#8208;stimuli, the complex can disintegrate and release the TCS and DFO in situ. By promoting tissue regeneration while eliminating microbial pathogens, the nanogel complex can effectively treat persistent periodontitis.







Abstract
Periodontitis is a microbe&#8208;driven inflammatory disease leading to bone resorption and tissue destruction. We propose a dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO) for combating microbial pathogens and promoting tissue regeneration. The nanogel system (NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO) that we fabricated from linear polyglycerol exhibits well&#8208;defined spherical morphology and a positively charged surface for bacteria adhesion. The rapid and sustained degradation of NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO in the acidic environment of an infection site induces the on&#8208;demand release of TCS and DFO. The NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO shows potent bacteria elimination of the gingivitis&#8208;causing bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis in both planktonic (99.9&#8201;%) and biofilm (99&#8201;%) states. Furthermore, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO can promote vascularization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Contributing to the synergistic effect of TCS and DFO, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO demonstrates significant bone tissue regeneration and accelerated healing of periodontitis in vivo. This polyglycerol&#8208;based nanogel may therefore offer smart combined delivery of multiple therapeutics against bacteria&#8208;driven diseases.

         <title>A Highly Dispersed Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalyst for Efficient Domino Hydroformylation Reductive Amination of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly dispersed Co&#8722;N/C catalyst has been developed for the efficient hydroaminomethylation of alkenes using CO and H2. This heterogeneous catalyst enables the synthesis of a broad range of secondary and tertiary amines, including pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The catalyst shows excellent activity, reusability, and scale&#8208;up potential, offering a green and cost&#8208;effective alternative to noble metal catalysts for amine synthesis.







Abstract
The hydroaminomethylation of alkenes using CO and H2 proceeds efficiently in the presence of a heterogeneous Co&#8722;N/C catalyst with highly dispersed metal centers. Various secondary and tertiary amines can be effectively synthesized from cyclic and linear aliphatic alkenes using this specific material. The active sites of the optimal catalyst result from the synergistic effect of atomically dispersed Co sites with their surrounding N atoms, and the high surface area as well as structural defects of the NC support. The broad applicability (&gt;54 examples), including pharmaceutically relevant molecules, together with the high activity and reusability, underline the general applicability of this catalytic system.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizer Prodrug for Self&#8208;Amplified Immune Therapy Via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work proposes a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for tumors and reports the first activatable photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis. Unlike existing combination therapies, HDIM demonstrates a significantly enhanced synergistic and cascading anti&#8208;tumor effect. Using HDIM, systemic immune activity is successfully remodeled to prevent tumor infiltration and metastasis.







Abstract
Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment, but its application is hindered by tumors&#8217; low immunogenicity and the difficulty of immune cell infiltration. Here, to address above issues and achieve targeted tumor treatment, we designed the first activated small molecule photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis, and proposed a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for enhanced tumor therapy. HDIM can be specifically activated by the tumor hypoxia and then simultaneously initiate immuno&#8208;therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;induced pyroptosis with NIR laser irradiation. Mechanism study demonstrated that the immunogenicity in tumor can be significantly enhanced by HDIM&#8208;induced pyroptosis and immune cells are recruited, thus effectively amplifying the therapeutic effect of the released immune drugs. As proof of application, we have utilized HDIM for primary tumor and distant tumor therapy. And the experiment results showed that compared to current monotherapy as well as simple combination therapy, the photosensitizer prodrug HDIM exhibited much superior tumor treatment effect owing to its synchronous activation of pyroptosis and immuno&#8208;therapy in tumor.

         <title>Converting Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;atom Catalyst to a New FeNxSey Cluster Catalyst for Proton&#8208;exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

This work successfully converts Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to an entirely new Fennessey cluster catalyst, which is highly active, selective, and strong H2O2&#8208;tolerance for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) single&#8208;atom catalyst is the most promising alternative to platinum catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however its high performance cannot be maintained for a long enough time in device operation. The construction of a new Fe coordination environment that is completely different from the square&#8208;planar Fe&#8722;N4 configuration in classic Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst is expected to break the current stability limits of Pt&#8208;free catalysts, which however remains unexplored. Here, we report, for the first time, the conversion of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to a new FeNxSey cluster catalyst, where the active Fe sites are three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) co&#8208;coordinated by N and Se atoms. Due to this unique Fe coordination configuration, the FeNxSey catalyst exhibits much better 4e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Specifically, the yields of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and &#8901;OH radicals on the FeNxSey catalyst are only one&#8208;quarter and one&#8208;third of that on the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart, respectively. Therefore, the FeNxSey catalyst exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, losing only 10&#8197;mV in half&#8208;wave potential E1/2 after 10,000 potential cycles, much smaller than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst (56&#8197;mV), representing the most stable Pt&#8208;free catalysts ever reported for PEMFCs. More significantly, the 3D co&#8208;coordination structure effectively inhibits the Fe demetallization of the FeNxSey catalyst in the presence of H2O2. As a result, the FeNxSey based PEMFC shows excellent durability, with the current density attenuation significantly lower than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C based device after accelerated durability testing. Our work provides guidance for the development of next&#8208;generation Pt&#8208;free catalysts for PEMFCs.

         <title>Harnessing Multi&#8208;Center&#8208;2&#8208;Electron Bonds for Carbene Metal&#8208;Hydride Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up approach leveraging preexisting m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds enables the synthesis of a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8208;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2. With superior stability to Stryker's reagent, DFT calculations attribute this stability to hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with &#960;&#8208;accepting carbenes. This bench&#8208;stable cluster serves as an efficient and selective copper&#8208;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst in several catalytic applications.

N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands possess the ability to stabilize metal&#8208;based nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. With respect to metal&#8208;hydride nanomaterials, however, carbenes are rare, which is surprising if one considers the importance of metal&#8208;hydride bonds across the chemical sciences. In this study, we introduce a bottom&#8208;up approach that leverages preexisting metal&#8208;metal m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds to access a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8208;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2 with superior stability compared to Stryker's reagent, a popular commercial phosphine&#8208;based copper hydride catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced stability stems from hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with the &#960;&#8208;accepting carbene. This new cluster emerges as an efficient and selective copper&#8208;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst, thereby providing a bench&#8208;stable alternative for catalytic applications.

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocyclic Carbenes for Enhanced Stability and Reactivity in Nanoparticle Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for effective surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs) utilizing block copolymers containing nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes blocks and poly(reactive ester) block. This approach enhances NPs&#8242; reactivity and stability, and is applicable to metal, metal oxide, and even rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are emerging as effective substitutes for conventional thiol ligands in surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs), offering exceptional stability to NPs under harsh conditions. However, the highly reactive feature of NHCs limits their use in introducing chemically active groups onto the NP surface. Herein, we develop a general yet robust strategy for the efficient surface functionalization of NPs with copolymer ligands bearing various functional groups. The polymer ligands consist of a multiple NHCs block, utilized for surface binding on NPs, alongside a poly(reactive ester) block intended for incorporating functional groups. The multiple NHCs block enables NPs with excellent colloidal stability across a broader range of pH values (0&#8211;14), temperature variations (&#8211;78&#8201;&#176;C&#8208;100&#8201;&#176;C), and electrolyte concentrations (0&#8211;1000&#8197;mM). Through the in situ ammonolysis of the poly(reactive ester) block, various active functional groups can be individually or together introduced on the NP surface. We further demonstrate the chemical reactivity of these functionalized NPs, including addition polymerization, Diels&#8211;Alder and Schiff base reactions. This method is applicable to various types of NPs, including metal NPs, metal oxide NPs, and even upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Photosensitizers: Cyanine&#8208;Carborane Salts for Superior Photodynamic Therapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multifaceted assessment of novel cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds exhibit efficient tumor targeting through uptake by organic anion&#8208;transporting polypeptides (OATP). Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, cyanine&#8208;carborane salts generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering apoptosis and significantly suppressing tumor cell proliferation and migration. In vivo studies demonstrate anti&#8208;tumor activity with minimal systemic toxicity, highlighting their potential as next&#8208;generation PDT therapeutics.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising targeted treatment for cancer. However, current PDT is limited by low tissue penetration, insufficient phototoxicity (toxicity with light irradiation), and undesirable cytotoxicity (toxicity without light irradiation). Here, we report the discovery of cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers (PSs) that harness the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing [cyanine+] with the inertness of [carborane&#8722;]. The implementation of [cyanine+] [carborane&#8722;] salts dramatically enhance cancer targeting of the PSs and decrease cytotoxicity. We characterize the cellular uptake of the cyanine&#8208;carborane PSs, organelle localization, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the ability to cogenerate multiple ROS species, suppression of pro&#8208;metastatic pathways, and activation of apoptotic pathways. We further demonstrate the ability of optimized PSs to eliminate tumors in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. These newly developed [cyanine+] [carborane&#8722;] salt PSs introduce a potent therapeutic approach against aggressive breast cancer while decreasing side effects.

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous and heterogeneous fluorescence with versatile colors were achieved on single crystals of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed bicomponent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with permanent porosity. Focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and microscopic fluorescence spectroscopy on single crystals reveal structure and property relationship.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of multicomponent molecules in a non&#8208;stoichiometric composition have drawn great interest due to their tunable properties. However, the photobehavior of the single crystals of such mixed HOFs has not been explored. Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization and photobehavior of single crystalline non&#8208;stoichiometric HOFs (NS&#8208;HOFs). NS&#8208;HOFs (BTNT&#8208;1) with various composition ratios were successfully obtained as single crystals from two analogue tetratopic carboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores (NTTA and BTTA, respectively). The heterogeneous distribution of the components was thoroughly confirmed by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy and local crystallographic analysis using focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray radiation. The versatile fluorescence of BTNT&#8208;1 behavior depends on the composition ratio and distribution of the component in the single crystals. We observed not only fluorescence bands with various colors such as purple, blue, green and white, depending on the composition ratios, but also different emission bands from a single crystal. We provide details on their emission lifetimes following the composition, emission color and targeted region on the crystal. This work is the first example of single crystal studies applied to organic porous co&#8208;crystals and demonstrates unique and versatile optical properties of carboxylic acid&#8208;based NS&#8208;HOFs. The results provide a concept of creating functional mixed porous materials capable of different and tunable optical properties.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Stepwise Reduction of Aliphatic Carboxylic Esters to Aldehydes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The method described here unlocks the puzzle of the photochemical reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters by sequential SET/HAT processes under the synergistic action of a phenolate&#8208;type photocatalyst and a thiol catalyst. The stepwise reduction of esters to aldehydes and alcohols under mild conditions provides a practical method for fundamental functional group transformation.







Abstract
The reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes and alcohols is a fundamental functional group transformation in chemistry. However, the inertness of carbonyl group and the instability of ketyl radical anion intermediate impede the reduction of carboxylic esters via photochemical strategy. Herein, we described the reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters with synergistic dual photocatalysis via phenolate&#8208;catalyzed single electron transfer process and thiol&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer process. The competitive back electron transfer process was effectively inhibited by protonation of the ketyl&#8208;type radical anion. This protocol enabled the efficient reduction of carboxylic esters to alcohols under mild conditions. By interruption of the reduction with prolinol, the step&#8208;controlled reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes was accomplished. The developed process was also successfully applied to the preparation of deuterated alcohols and aldehydes from esters with D2O as the deuterium source.

&lt;p&gt;The method described here unlocks the puzzle of the photochemical reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters by sequential SET/HAT processes under the synergistic action of a phenolate-type photocatalyst and a thiol catalyst. The stepwise reduction of esters to aldehydes and alcohols under mild conditions provides a practical method for fundamental functional group transformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes and alcohols is a fundamental functional group transformation in chemistry. However, the inertness of carbonyl group and the instability of ketyl radical anion intermediate impede the reduction of carboxylic esters via photochemical strategy. Herein, we described the reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters with synergistic dual photocatalysis via phenolate-catalyzed single electron transfer process and thiol-catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer process. The competitive back electron transfer process was effectively inhibited by protonation of the ketyl-type radical anion. This protocol enabled the efficient reduction of carboxylic esters to alcohols under mild conditions. By interruption of the reduction with prolinol, the step-controlled reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes was accomplished. The developed process was also successfully applied to the preparation of deuterated alcohols and aldehydes from esters with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as the deuterium source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stable Open&#8208;Shelled Au26 Nanocluster with Remarkable Performance in Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable open&#8208;shelled Au26 nanocluster with 15 valence electrons has been synthesized, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by magnetic measurements. This cluster shows high stability and excellent catalytic performance in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, achieving a record high TON of 100670 among atomically precise gold nanoclusters.







Abstract
Open metal sites are crucial in catalysis. We have used a &#8220;loose coordination strategy&#8221; (LCS) to preorganize open metal sites in gold cluster catalysts. A gold nanocluster with composition of [Au26(3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form)9(iPr2&#8208;imy)3(Me2S)](BF4)2 (iPr2&#8208;imy=1,3&#8208;Diisopropylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form=N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;phenyl)formamidine) (Au26) has been obtained by one pot synthesis, i.e. the direct reduction of Me2SAuCl in the presence of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and amidinate ligands. ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS reveals that the Me2S ligand is detached from the cluster to form open sites. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Surprisingly, Au26 has 15 valence electrons, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This open&#8208;shelled Au26 not only shows unexpected high stability but also exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, achieving a remarkable turnover number up to 100670.

         <title>Isolated Neutral Organic Radical Unveiled Solvent&#8208;Radical Interaction in Highly Reducing Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated neutral helicene radical revealed the missing link in highly photoreducing consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) mechanism. Extensive mechanistic studies implied interaction of short&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive photoexcited radical and acetonitrile that generates reduced solvent. To that end, numerous extreme photoreduction have been showcased through useful functionalization of aryl halides using reduced solvent mediated conPET method.







Abstract
Diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics is a key mechanistic debate when consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) is discussed in photoredox catalysis. In&#8197;situ generated organic photoactive radicals can access catalytic systems as reducing as alkaline metals that can activate remarkably stable bonds. However, in many cases, the extremely short&#8208;lived transient nature of these doublet state open&#8208;shell species has led to debatable mechanistic studies, hindering adoption and development. Herein, we document the use of an isolated and stable neutral organic nPrDMQA radical as a highly photoreducing species. The isolated radical offers a unique platform to investigate the mechanism behind the photocatalytic activity of organic photocatalyst radicals. The involvement of reduced solvent is observed, formed by single electron transfer (SET) between the short&#8208;lived excited state nPrDMQA radical and the solvent. In our detailed mechanistic studies, spectroscopic and chemical affirmation of solvent reduction is strongly evident. Reduction of aryl halides, including difluoroarenes is presented as a model study of the conPET method. Further, the activation of N2O, a greenhouse gas that is yet to be activated by photoredox catalysis, is showcased in the absence of a transition metal.

         <title>Adamantane&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate Phosphors AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ via Medium&#8208;Pressure Ion&#8208;Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the synthesis of nitridophosphate&#8208;based phosphors using hot isostatic pressing is presented. Ion exchange reactions starting from the Li&#8208;ion conductor Li10P4N10 enables the preparation of single crystals and bulk samples of compounds with the general formula AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10. Upon doping with Eu2+, these compounds exhibit remarkable luminescent properties across the green to red spectral range.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates have emerged as promising host compounds in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. Their industrial relevance has increased significantly, mainly due to recent advances in synthetic approaches under medium&#8208;pressure (MP) conditions, including ammonothermal synthesis and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary representatives CaxLi10&#8722;2xP4N10 (x=2, 2.7, 4) and Sr3Li4P4N10, prepared via a simplified ion exchange reaction under MP conditions, starting from the nitridophosphate&#8208;based lithium ion conductor Li10P4N10. The synthesis route allowed for the preservation of the anionic [P4N10]10&#8722; structural motif of the starting material, while simultaneously introducing potential doping sites for Eu2+ by incorporating divalent alkaline earth cations (Ca2+/Sr2+). Upon excitation of Eu2+ doped samples with blue light, strong luminescence due to parity&#8208;allowed 4f6(7F)5d1&#8594;4f7(8S7/2) transition can be observed in the red (Ca2Li6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=626&#8197;nm), yellow/orange (Ca2.7Li4.6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max1=506&#8197;nm, &#955;max2=592&#8197;nm and Sr3Li4P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=596&#8197;nm) and green (Ca4Li2P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=546&#8197;nm) spectral regions of the visible light. The compounds presented, together with the simplified synthetic approach, demonstrate the significant potential of ion exchange on Li ion conductors for the development of novel nitridophosphates in the future.

         <title>The Intrinsic Fluorescence of Peptide Self&#8208;Assemblies Across pH Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation deciphers the pivotal role of main&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding in peptide self&#8208;assembly as the primary source of intrinsic fluorescence. It demonstrates how pH&#8208;induced morphological diversity in peptides maintains fixed fluorescence peaks through the integrity of these bonding networks, while fluorescence intensity is modulated by structural variations. The study preliminarily unveils the fluorescence properties and regulatory mechanisms of self&#8208;assembled peptides.







Abstract
The regulation of solution pH on the structural and optical properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies remains a critical yet unresolved issue in peptide research. This study investigates the heptapeptide Ac&#8208;IHIHIQI&#8208;NH2 and its intrinsic fluorescence across a range of pH levels, demonstrating that variations in pH lead to significant changes in the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures. While the position of the fluorescence emission remains constant&#8212;due to the stability provided by the hydrogen bonding network of the peptide backbone&#8212;the intensity of the fluorescence exhibits a direct correlation with the degree of self&#8208;assembly. This finding underscores a dynamic relationship between structural morphology and optical properties. Notably, the ability of the peptide to self&#8208;assemble under diverse pH conditions is a novel observation that contrasts with previously reported literature. By employing a computationally driven approach, complemented by rigorous experimental validation, this work establishes a new paradigm for studying complex interacting systems such as peptide self&#8208;assembly. Our findings enhance the understanding of how environmental factors influence peptide behavior and pave the way for the design of innovative peptide&#8208;based materials with tunable optical characteristics, with potential applications in bioluminescent probes and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Coordinative Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;Electron Magnetic Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;coordinated polymers of &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins were fabricated by on&#8208;surface synthesis and coordination chemistry methods. Each porphyrinoid monomer features antiferromagnetic coupling and no interaction between nearest neighbors within the polymer backbone, behaving as a single magnetic entity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Electron magnetic compounds on surfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to interrogate spin interactions at the atomic scale, with great potential in spintronics and quantum technologies. A key challenge is organizing these compounds over large length scales, while elucidating their resulting magnetic properties. Herein, we offer a relevant contribution toward this objective, which consists of using on&#8208;surface synthesis coupled with coordination chemistry to promote the self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic porphyrin species. A porphyrin precursor equipped with carbonitrile moieties in a trans arrangement was prepared by solution synthesis and deposited on Au(111)/mica. Depending on the specific growth protocol, surface&#8208;promoted reactions led to the transformation of the precursor into non&#8208;magnetic Au&#8208;CN coordinated porphyrin monomers, covalent porphyrin dimers, and one&#8208;dimensional porphyrin polymers (based on porphyrin monomers or covalent porphyrin dimers), as revealed by scanning probe microscopy studies combined with theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the scanning tunneling microscopy tip could convert such closed&#8208;shell porphyrin units into open&#8208;shell species by the removal of some peripheral hydrogen atoms. The magnetic features (i.e., singlet or triplet ground state) of the porphyrin units comprising the polymers were investigated for polymers of different lengths. No magnetic exchange coupling between adjacent units was observed, suggesting protection of the magnetic entities.

         <title>Dendritic Molecular Baskets for Selective Binding of Toxic Methotrexate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic molecular baskets are biocompatible cavitands capable of including toxic methotrexate (MTX) in their aromatic cavity. The binding is chemoselective with the complex forming in competitive cell media. With the unique mode of recognition and modular structure, dendritic baskets are leading candidates for developing effective antidotes against MTX poisoning.







Abstract
We describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and bioactivity of dendritic basket 612&#8722;. This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (S)&#8208;glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self&#8208;association. 1H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between 612&#8722; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX2&#8722;) in water (Kd=9.2&#8197;&#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX2&#8722; folds inside 612&#8722; (&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N&#8208;methyl group. In consequence, 612&#8722; selectively binds MTX2&#8722; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC50&gt;150&#8197;&#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;6]14&#8722; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX2&#8722; as dihydrofolate reductase's affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of 612&#8722;. Nonetheless, considering the basket's biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Aromatic Linkers in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on the Performance of Monolithic Perovskite/Si Tandem Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PTZ&#8208;SAMs with various aromatic linkers and linking orientations were designed and synthesized as the hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). &#946;&#8208;NapPAPT could form dense and highly ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level alignment with the perovskite films.







Abstract
Aromatic linker&#8208;constructed self&#8208;assembled monolayers (Ar&#8208;SAMs) with enlarged dipole moment can modulate the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO), thereby improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. However, the specific role of the aromatic linkers between the polycyclic head and the anchoring groups of SAMs in determining the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we developed a series of phenothiazine&#8208;based Ar&#8208;SAMs to investigate how different aromatic linkers could affect molecular stacking, the regulation of substrate work function, and charge carrier dynamics. When served as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in PSCs and monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs), we found that the Ar&#8208;SAM with naphthalene linker along the 2,6&#8208;position axis (&#946;&#8208;Nap) could form dense and highly ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level alignment with the perovskite films. Using this strategy, the optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.86&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis, utilizing a 1.68&#8197;eV perovskite. Additionally, the encapsulated devices demonstrated enhanced stability under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2, 50&#8201;% RH, 65&#8201;&#176;C) with a T91 of 1000&#8197;hours. Notably, the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs, based on solution&#8208;processed micron&#8208;scale textured silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, achieved an efficiency of 28.89&#8201;% while maintaining outstanding reproducibility. This strategy holds significant promise for developing aromatic linking groups to enhance the hole selectivity of SAMs.

         <title>Locking up G&#8208;Quadruplexes with Light&#8208;Triggered Staples Leads to Increased Topological, Thermodynamic, and Metabolic Stability</title>

A photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) and intercalated motif (IM) structures enhances their stability, locks their topology, and increases enzymatic resistance while preserving biological activity. This method, applied to the Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) model and other G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, shows promise for future therapeutic applications, including more stable aptamers and molecular decoys in biological systems.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) are secondary, tetraplexed DNA structures abundant in non&#8208;coding regions of the genome, implicated in gene transcription processes and currently firmly recognised as important potential therapeutic targets. Given their affinity for human proteins, G4 structures are investigated as potential decoys and aptamers. However, G4&#8197;s tend to adopt different conformations depending on the exact environmental conditions, and often only one displays the specifically desired biological activity. Their less intensively studied counterparts, the elusive tetraplexed intercalated&#8208;motifs (IMs) are typically unstable at neutral pH, hampering the investigation of their potential involvement in a biological context. We herein report on a photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; such tetraplexed&#8208;structures, to increase their stability, lock their topology and enhance their enzymatic resistance, while maintaining biological activity. The chemical structure and topology of the stapled Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) was spectroscopically characterised and rationalised in silico. The method was then extended to other biologically relevant G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, hinting towards potential application of such stapled structures in a therapeutic context.

         <title>Buffered Hydroxyl Radical for Photocatalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative Methane Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven chemical cycle to generate &#8901;OH buffer, in which SO42&#8722; moderates &#8901;OH concentration by balancing &#8901;OH generation from excited&#8208;state [FeIII(SO4)(H2O)5]+ and the back reaction between &#8901;OH and Fe2+.







Abstract
Hydroxy radical (&#8901;OH) is a prestigious oxidant that allows the cleavage of strong chemical bonds of methane but is untamed, leading to over&#8208;oxidation of methane and waste of oxidants, especially at high methane conversion. Here, we managed to buffer &#8901;OH in an aqueous solution of photo&#8208;irradiated Fe3+, where &#8901;OH almost participates in methane oxidation. Due to the interaction between Fe3+ and SO42&#8722;, the electron transfer from OH&#8722; to excited&#8208;state Fe3+ for &#8901;OH generation is retarded, while excessive &#8901;OH is consumed by generated Fe2+ to restore Fe3+. When combined with a Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalyst, the buffered &#8901;OH converts methane to C2+ hydrocarbons and H2 with formation rates of 246 and 418&#8197;&#956;mol h&#8722;1, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches 13.0&#177;0.2&#8201;%, along with 10.2&#8201;% methane conversion and 81&#8201;% C2+ selectivity after 80&#8197;hours of reaction. Overall, this work presents a strategy for controlling active radicals for selective and efficient photocatalysis.

         <title>Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox Electrocatalyst for Durable Oxygen Evolution in Acid Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Cl&#8722;&#8208;assisted active site transfer strategy on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, achieving high OER selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic seawater. Typically, *Cl occupies the Ru site, shifting the OER center to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn, preventing metal site dissolution. Additionally, the active Mn sites create an environment that favors OER over CER, offering a selective and durable solution for acidic seawater electrolysis.







Abstract
Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir&#8208;based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non&#8208;precious Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200&#8197;hours. Different from the Cl&#8722;&#8208;free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER&#8208;insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER&#8208;favored local environment that inhibits CER. We introduce Cl&#8722;&#8208;assisted transfer of OER active sites to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn as a fundamental strategy for achieving highly selective and durable oxygen evolution in acidic seawater.

         <title>Low Evaporation Enthalpy Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting at Low Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

Ionic COFs with numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability were developed, achieving efficient water vapor adsorption and low enthalpy of evaporation at low humidity, offering cost&#8208;effective solutions for fresh water collection in desert regions.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25&#8201;%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25&#8201;%. These iCOFs are characterized by numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability, enabling efficient water vapor adsorption even at relatively low humidity levels. Through the use of various hygroscopic salt cations and precise control of ion concentration within the pores, the water state within the iCOFs pores can be effectively managed. Among the iCOFs, TB-COF-Li stands out with an impressive adsorption capacity of 0.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from 0 to 22&#8201;% RH. Notably, due to its ionic porous structure, TB-COF-Li exhibits a significantly lower enthalpy of evaporation, measured at 967.04&#8197;J&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to bulk water with an enthalpy of 2387.40&#8197;J&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, under simulated conditions of 1.5 solar intensity at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the majority of the adsorbed water can be rapidly desorbed without the need for additional energy input. This efficient desorption process contributes to a high water collection rate of 0.092&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the final atmospheric water harvesting device.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Olefins on Anorthic NaCoFe Alloy Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active (FexCoy)5C2 structure is developed through the synergistic effect of electronic (sodium) and structural (cobalt) promoters. This strategy facilitates the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into olefins at a low temperature of 240&#8201;&#176;C, achieving the highest STY of olefins at low temperatures, even better than a significant proportion under high&#8208;temperature operating conditions. Additionally, it retains the capability to synthesize olefins at 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins (CTO) represents an ideal pathway towards carbon neutrality. However, most current CTO catalysts require a high&#8208;temperature condition of 300&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C, resulting in high energy consumption and possible aggregation among active sites. Herein, we developed an efficient iron&#8208;based catalyst modified with high&#8208;sodium content (7&#8201;%) and low&#8208;cobalt content (2&#8201;%), achieving a CO2 conversion of 22.0&#8201;% and an olefin selectivity of 55.9&#8201;% at 240&#8201;&#176;C and 1000&#8197;mL/g/h, and it is even active at 180&#8201;&#176;C and 4000&#8197;mL/g/h with more than 25&#8201;% olefins in hydrocarbons. The catalyst was kept stable under continuous operating conditions of 500&#8197;hours. Numerous characterizations and calculations reveal high content of sodium as an electronic promoter enhances the stability of the active anorthic Fe5C2 phase at low temperatures. Further incorporating the above catalyst with cobalt, as a structural promoter, causes Fe species to form a FexCoy alloying phase, which in turn facilitates the formation of higher active anorthic (FexCoy)5C2 phase, different from the conventional carbides and alloy carbides. An in&#8208;depth investigation of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic promoters can improve catalyst performance, increase reaction efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and provide profound insights for understanding and optimizing CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Electron Transfer Mediator Modulates Type II Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Photosensitizers for Type I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal electron transfer&#8208;based strategy is introduced to modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This approach enables the conversion of existing Type&#8197;II MOFs into Type&#8197;I MOFs with hypoxic tolerance to function effectively under low&#8208;oxygen conditions, providing new insight into the development of Type&#8197;I MOFs.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive and effective local treatment, heavily depends on photosensitizer (PS) performance and oxygen availability. Despite the use of PS&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to address the solubility and aggregation issues of PSs, the inherent hypoxic intolerance of mainstream Type&#8197;II PDT remains challenging. Herein, we report an electron transfer strategy for the fabrication of hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type&#8197;I MOFs by encapsulating thymoquinone (TQ) into existing Type&#8197;II MOFs. With TQ serving as an effective electron transfer mediator, it facilitates the electron transfer process from the MOF ligand PS to oxygen, establishing the Type&#8197;I pathway and attenuating the original Type&#8197;II pathway. Four representative porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are synthesized to demonstrate the proposed strategy. Our findings reveal that TQ@MOF&#8208;1 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit enhanced anticancer activity under hypoxic conditions and superior in vivo antitumor efficacy compared to parent MOF&#8208;1 NPs. This work offers an effective and universal strategy to modulate ROS generation in PS&#8208;based MOFs, endowing hypoxic tolerance with improved PDT performance against solid tumors.

         <title>Tailoring the Reprocessability of Thiol&#8208;Ene Networks through Ring Size Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprocessing of thiol&#8208;ene networks was accomplished by carefully tuning the relative distance between two thioether functionalities and elevating the neighboring group participation concept. As a result we achieved a fast bond exchange at high temperatures. This allowed extrusion processing of cross&#8208;linked materials, while maintaining structural integrity below 70&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Recycling thermosetting materials presents itself as a major challenge in achieving sustainable material use. Dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking of polymers has emerged as a viable solution that can combine the structural integrity of thermosetting materials with the (re&#8722;)processability of thermoplastics. Thioether linkages between polymer chains are quite common, and their use dates back to the vulcanization of rubbers. While it is known that thioether bonds can be triggered to exchange through transalkylation reactions, this process is usually slow, as thioether moieties not only have to be activated by an alkylating agent, but the activated thioether also has to associate with a second thioether moiety in a classical SN2&#8208;type process. Here, we present the rational design of dynamic polymer networks based on simple dithiol&#8208;based monomers and a fatty acid derived triene. Two neighboring thioethers can undergo a much faster bond exchange reaction, and we found that the exchange dynamics can be further tuned over almost three orders of magnitude by tailoring the distance between two thioether functionalities. This resulted in thioether&#8208;cross&#8208;linked materials that could be processed by extrusion, a continuous reprocessing technique that was previously not accessible for this class of cross&#8208;linked materials, while still exhibiting appealing creep&#8208;resistance below 70&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a perovskite quantum dot (QD)&#8208;dye system for efficient energy transfer (ET) from QDs to dyes occurring via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type interaction, at minimal donor&#8208;acceptor spectral overlap. Dyes containing a dimethyl iminium binding group as part of their conjugated system are chosen for high binding affinity to QD surface, crucial for donor&#8208;acceptor spatial wavefunction overlap for efficient ET.







Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes to CsPbBr3 surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications, such as lighting.

     alt="Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely-Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work designs a perovskite quantum dot (QD)-dye system for efficient energy transfer (ET) from QDs to dyes occurring via the Dexter exchange-type interaction, at minimal donor-acceptor spectral overlap. Dyes containing a dimethyl iminium binding group as part of their conjugated system are chosen for high binding affinity to QD surface, crucial for donor-acceptor spatial wavefunction overlap for efficient ET.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD-dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QD-dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes to CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange-type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD-molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications, such as lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products by Modulating the Surface Microenvironment of Electrode with Polyethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

PEG was incorporated into the Cu electrode, achieving an FEC2+ of 90.3&#8201;% at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This modification relaxes Nafion, increasing active site availability and enhancing *CO and *OH adsorption, promoting C&#8722;C coupling. Simultaneously, the restructured hydrogen bond network reduces active hydrogen species, suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Modulating the surface microenvironment of electrodes stands as a pivotal aspect in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, we propose an innovative approach by incorporating a small amount of linear oligomer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), into Cu2O catalysts during the preparation of the CuPEG electrode. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward multicarbon products (C2+) increases from 69.3&#8201;% over Cu electrode without PEG to 90.3&#8201;% over CuPEG electrode at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH in a flow cell. In situ investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that PEG molecules significantly modify the microenvironment on the Cu surface through hydrogen bond interactions. This modification leads to the relaxation of Nafion, increasing the availability of active sites and enhancing the adsorption of *CO and *OH, which in turn promotes C&#8722;C coupling. Concurrently, the reconstructed hydrogen bond network reduces the presence of active hydrogen species, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Strained Dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane Enabled Planar Chirality Construction and [2.2]Paracyclophane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthesis of strained dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane, a benzyne analogue of [2.2]paracyclophane was realized and it could be utilized in various strain&#8208;release nucleophilic or cycloaddition reactions to synthesize diverse functionalized [2.2]paracyclophanes. A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent alkynylation of this intermediate generated valuable planar chiral PCP building blocks and heterocycles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity. This method provides a new general platform for challenging planar chirality construction.







Abstract
Planar chirality found tremendous use in many fields, such as chemistry, optics, and materials science. In particular, planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) are a type of structurally interesting and practically useful chiral compounds bearing unique electronic and photophysical properties and thus have been widely used in &#960;&#8208;stacking polymers, organic luminescent materials, and as a valuable toolbox for developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts. However, the synthesis of chiral PCP derivatives remains a longstanding challenge. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on chiral preparative liquid chromatography separation or chemical and kinetic resolution reactions. Here, we report an enantioconvergent alkynylation of an in situ&#8208;formed dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane intermediate by asymmetric copper(I) catalysis. This approach enables the efficient synthesis of valuable planar chiral PCP building blocks and heterocycles with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. The success of this reaction lies in the development of a practical route to access strained dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane intermediates, which can also be utilized in various strain&#8208;release nucleophilic or cycloaddition reactions to synthesize diverse functionalized PCPs. DFT calculations of this reaction suggest that the enantioselectivity is determined by the aryne complexation with chiral copper(I) acetylide and the subsequent insertion reaction.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Skeletal Rearrangement Enables the Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Xanthenes with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first example of a photocatalyzed intramolecular skeletal rearrangement strategy for constructing the xanthene scaffold. This approach has been successfully applied to synthesize highly functionalized xanthenes and to revise the structures of myrtucomvalones E and F. Furthermore, biological studies reveal that a xanthene demonstrates significant antiosteosarcoma activity both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Highly functionalized xanthenes possess an impressive range of bioactivities and daunting synthetic challenge due to their unique ring systems and stereocenters. Here, we report an unprecedented ketyl radicals&#8208;induced skeletal rearrangement reaction of spirodihydrobenzofurans, enabled by zero&#8208;valent iron as reducing agents via photoredox catalysis, facilitating the facile preparation of various highly functionalized xanthenes. The features of this protocol include high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, exceptionally mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, scalability to gram&#8208;scale quantities, and consistent delivery of good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies rationalize the function of this zero&#8208;valent iron&#8208;based reactivity in radical generation. Notably, this reaction was applied to the first asymmetric total synthesis of the complex polycyclic xanthene ent&#8208;myrtucomvalones E&#8722;F. Moreover, this work led to the discovery of an agent with highly effective antiosteosarcoma activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, potentially paving the way for the development of new xanthene&#8208;based candidates for osteosarcoma treatment.

         <title>The Role of Electron Transfer in Copper&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes were used to elucidate the mechanism of Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. For electron&#8208;rich substrates, a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism is followed, whereas electron&#8208;poor substrates follow CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr).







Abstract
We report copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes supported by a pyridinedicarboxamide ligand (L) as a platform for investigating the role of electron transfer in C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. While the copper(II) trifluoromethyl complex is unreactive towards (hetero)arenes, the formal copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex performs C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide range of (hetero)arenes. Mechanistic studies using the copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex suggest that the mechanism of arene trifluoromethylation is substrate&#8208;dependent. When the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer is high, the reaction proceeds through a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, where an initial electron transfer occurs between the substrate and oxidant prior to CF3 group transfer. Otherwise, a CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism is followed. These studies provide valuable insights into the role of strong oxidants and potential mechanistic dichotomy in Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.

When the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer is high, the reaction proceeds through a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, where an initial electron transfer occurs between the substrate and oxidant prior to CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group transfer. Otherwise, a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) mechanism is followed. These studies provide valuable insights into the role of strong oxidants and potential mechanistic dichotomy in Cu-mediated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Mesoscopic Disorder in Graphitic Carbon with Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. Our combined experimental and theoretical work provides a roadmap for elucidating mesoscopic disorder in graphitic carbon electrode materials under potential bias.







Abstract
Intrinsic structural and oxidic defects activate graphitic carbon electrodes towards electrochemical reactions underpinning energy conversion and storage technologies. Yet, these defects can also disrupt the long&#8208;range and periodic arrangement of carbon atoms, thus, the characterization of graphitic carbon electrodes necessitates in&#8208;situ atomistic differentiation of graphitic regions from mesoscopic bulk disorder. Here, we leverage the combined techniques of in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations to reveal that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. With this platform, we identify graphitic regions from amorphous domains by discovering that they demonstrate opposing electric&#8208;field&#8208;dependent infrared activity under electrochemical conditions. Our work provides a roadmap for identifying mesoscopic disorder in bulk carbon materials under potential bias.

         <title>Achieving over 20&#8201;% Efficiency in Laminated HTM&#8208;Free Carbon Electrode Perovskite Solar Cells through In Situ Interface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a chemical&#8208;mechanical in situ interface reconstruction strategy for the fabrication of HTM&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c&#8208;PSCs) by laminating a free&#8208;standing carbon electrode onto perovskite film. Our new strategy overcomes the contact issues within the perovskite/carbon electrode interface and boosts the efficiency to 20.31&#8201;% with enhanced stability.







Abstract
Laminating a free&#8208;standing carbon electrode film onto perovskite film is a promising method for fabricating HTM (hole transport material)&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c&#8208;PSCs), offering more flexibility by decoupling the processes of carbon electrode and perovskite layer formation. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of laminated HTM&#8208;free c&#8208;PSCs (&lt;16.5&#8201;%) remains lower compared to c&#8208;PSCs with printed carbon pastes (&gt;20&#8201;%), primarily due to poor interfacial contact between the perovskite and carbon layers. Herein, we report a chemical&#8208;mechanical driven in situ interface reconstruction strategy to solve such interface contact issues. The in situ interface reconstruction is firstly triggered by methylammonium chloride (MACl) surface treatment to chemically activate the film and then mechanically laminate the carbon electrode onto the softened perovskite film under heating. The perovskite film undergoes in situ regrowth and the carbon film starts to cure simultaneously, dynamically reconstructing the perovskite/carbon electrode interface. A tighter and conformal contact is achieved, greatly facilitating the carrier transport and extract. Ultimately, a champion PCE of 20.31&#8201;% is achieved with enhanced stability. Our in situ interface reconstruction strategy which is combinating the chemical and mechanical process offers a new choice for the further design of low&#8208;cost and efficient HTM&#8208;free c&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polyesters and Polycarbonates by Magnesium&#8208;Based Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MgCl2 catalyst system exhibits high selectivity and compatibility towards the depolymerization of the aliphatic (co)polyesters and polycarbonates under mild, solvent&#8208;free conditions (up to 98&#8201;% monomer yields). This approach provides a promising solution to the circular utilization of plastic materials.







Abstract
Developing a simple and efficient catalyst system for closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers to monomers is an essentially important but challenging task for the recycle of polymer wastes and preventing the downcycle of plastic products. Herein, we employ inexpensive, commercially available Lewis acids (LAs) to achieve closed&#8208;loop recycling in bulk through the catalytic depolymerization of aliphatic polyesters and polycarbonates. The scope of LAs is screened by thermogravimetric analysis experiments and distillation experiments. MgCl2 shows the best catalytic performance that can efficiently depolymerize eleven aliphatic polyesters and polycarbonates (i.e. poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) and poly(trimethylene carbonate)), into monomers (up to 98&#8201;% yield) at temperatures significantly lower than the ceiling temperature. Moreover, this catalyst system exhibits high selectivity and compatibility towards the depolymerization of (co)polyesters as well as the blends of polyesters and polycarbonates in the presence of other commodity plastics, as well as excellent recycle and reuse catalyst performance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the closed&#8208;loop recycling of monomers is achieved through the random chain scission and terminal group cyclization.

         <title>Regulating Crystalline Phase/Plane of Polymer Electrolyte for Rapid Lithium Ion Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insight into the mechanism of crystal phase and plane exerts on the transfer of lithium ion in poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) based polymer electrolytes is investigated in depth. &#946;&#8208;phase&#8208;dominant segments are obtained by regulating dissolving process and the newly exposed (111/201)&#946; crystal planes are conducive to provide more ion transport channels, which is beneficial to the rapid and smooth transfer of lithium ion.







Abstract
Electronic&#8208;rich functional groups and flexible segments have long been perceived to be the decisive factors influencing lithium&#8208;ion transfer in polymer electrolytes, while crystallinity is regarded as the great scourge. Actually, the research on the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane is still in scarcity. Herein, taking poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as an example, new (111/201) crystal planes (belonged to &#946;&#8208;phase) are regulated by dissolving process and clarified by Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the newly exposed (111/201) crystal planes provide higher binding energy with lithium ions and are conducive to provide more ion transport channels. 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance of new crystalline planes contained PVDF&#8208;HFP based electrolyte shows lower field and sharper peak intensity, further proves the rapid lithium ion transfer. Therefore, a high ionic conductivity of 6.42&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a large lithium&#8208;ion transfer number of 0.7 are achieved. This study offers a new insight into the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane on the transfer of lithium ion for polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Evolution of Supramolecular Coordination Assemblies Visually Monitored by Time&#8208;Dependent Multicolor Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable nanofiber structures triggered by the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and coordination between zinc ions and the organic ligands evolved into nanosheet assemblies over time in water, accompanied by fluorescence changes that enabled visual monitoring. This strategy could be extended to multiple ions and offers applications in temporal dynamic fluorescence encryption.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination assemblies play an important role in both material science and biological systems. Despite significant efforts in their development, most existing examples are thermodynamically controlled, which lack the adaptability and autonomy essential for the creation of advanced materials. In this work, we have developed non&#8208;equilibrium coordination assembly systems that can evolve over time through a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic controls. The introduction of zinc ions resulted in the formation of metastable fiber assemblies in a kinetically trapped state, which autonomously converted to thermodynamically stable nanosheets over time. This evolution process can be regulated by external stimuli and visually monitored by the time&#8208;dependent multicolor fluorescence. The construction strategy was versatile across other various ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, offering inspiring insights for the design of complex systems that operated both in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Enhanced Photoiniferter Polymerization under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter polymerization operating efficiently under visible light is reported. Addition of biocompatible citric acid, accelerates photolysis, eliminating induction periods by enhancing chain transfer agent consumption and reaction rates. This method yields well&#8208;defined polymers with near&#8208;quantitative conversions in just two hours and demonstrates versatility across various monomers, including the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers.







Abstract
Photoiniferter (PI) is a promising polymerization methodology, often used to overcome restrictions posed by thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization. However, in the overwhelming majority of reports, high energy UV irradiation is required to effectively trigger photolysis of RAFT agents and facilitate the polymerization, significantly limiting its potential, scope, and applicability. Although visible light PI has emerged as a highly attractive alternative, most current approaches are limited to the synthesis of lower molecular weight polymers (i.e. 10,000&#8197;g/mol), and typically suffer from prolonged reaction times, extended induction periods, and higher dispersities when high activity CTAs (photoiniferters), such as trithiocarbonates, are employed. Herein, an acid&#8208;enhanced PI polymerization is introduced that efficiently operates under visible light irradiation. The presence of small amounts of biocompatible citric acid fully eliminates the lengthy induction period (21&#8197;hours) by enhancing photolysis, rapidly consuming the CTA, and accelerating the reaction rate, yielding polymers with narrow molar mass distributions (&#208; ~1.1), near&#8208;quantitative conversions (&gt;97&#8201;%), and high end&#8208;group fidelity in just two hours. A particularly noteworthy aspect of this work is the possibility to target very high degrees of polymerization (i.e. DP=3,000) within short timescales (i.e. less than five hours) without compromising the control over the dispersity (&#208; ~1.1). The versatility of the technique is further demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined diblock copolymers and its compatibility to various polymer classes (i.e. acrylamides, acrylates, methacrylates), thus establishing visible&#8208;light PI as a robust tool for polymer synthesis.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Interpenetration&#8208;Free Mesoporous Aromatic Frameworks by Manipulating Catalysts as Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning the size of the catalyst ligand, a mesoporous aromatic framework, PAF&#8208;333, was obtained. It was found that the steric hindrance of larger&#8208;sized ligands avoided the framework interpenetration. Thanks to its large pore volume (3.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), it could adsorb 13.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% of hydrogen at 77&#8197;K, 100&#8197;bar and 0.537&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 of methane at 298&#8197;K, 98&#8197;bar, making it an ideal candidate for large&#8208;scale on&#8208;board methane storage.







Abstract
Reticular chemistry allows the design and synthesis of mesoporous networks by extending the size of the building blocks. However, interpenetration of the nets easily happens against the designed mesoporous networks, thereby falling short of achieving the intended specific surface area and pore size. Controlling the framework interpenetration has always been a challenge in the synthesis section of reticular chemistry. In this work, based on our previously reported type of highly porous aromatic frameworks (named PAF&#8208;1), we extended the tetrahedral building blocks to target an iso&#8208;reticular mesoporous PAF&#8208;333. A series of Ni(0) ligands with different sizes were employed to confirm that suitable&#8208;sized catalyst ligands could successfully inhibit skeleton interpenetration in the coupling reaction through the steric hindrance effect. The obtained mesoporous PAF&#8208;333 possessed a pore size of approximately 3.2&#8197;nm matching well with the value from the predicted non&#8208;interpenetrated structure. PAF&#8208;333 showed great high&#8208;pressure hydrogen and methane storage potential with a 13.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 uptake at 77&#8197;K, 100&#8197;bar and a 0.537&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 CH4 uptake at 298&#8197;K, 98&#8197;bar, ranking at the top of the reported porous adsorbents in the gas storage applications.

         <title>Manipulating Interphase Chemistry for Aqueous Zn Stabilization: The Role of Supersaturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn4SO4(OH)6&#8901;xH2O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation&#8208;controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. Attributed to the supersaturated environment created by caprolactam, ZSH selectively exposes high&#8208;energy (001) plane and initiates a pseudo&#8208;coincidence interface that significantly boosts the Zn lifespan.







Abstract
The limited cycling durability of Zn anode, attributed to the absence of a robust electrolyte&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), remains the bottleneck for the practical deployment of aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn4SO4(OH)6&#8901;xH2O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation&#8208;controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. By judiciously creating local high&#8208;supersaturation environment with organic caprolactam to manipulate the precipitation manner of zinc sulfate hydroxide (ZSH), lattice&#8208;lattice matched heterogeneous nucleation of ZSH (001) and Zn (002) is realized in aqueous ZnSO4, producing a dense, pseudo&#8208;coincidence interface capable of functioning as decent SEI. The plating/stripping efficacy of Zn is significantly boosted, as reflected by the great improvement of the initial (from 59.9&#8201;% to 84.1&#8201;%) and average (from 94.0&#8201;% to 99.2&#8201;%) coulombic efficiency. Accordingly, the cyclic endurance of Zn anode is prolonged from 50&#8197;h to over 7000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, witnessing 140&#8208;fold lifespan extension. Profiting from supersaturation&#8208;mediated Zn stabilization, the performance deterioration of zinc&#8208;vanadium batteries is also alleviated, even with a low N/P ratio of 4.4. This work is anticipated to deepen current understanding on the control of the anodic chemistry.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for embedding catalytically active polyoxovanadate (POV) into supramolecular assemblies was developed by utilizing host&#8208;guest interactions between pillararenes grafted on the cluster and ditopic linkers. The amphiphilic nature of the POV in the host&#8208;guest complex promoted responsive behavior of the assembly toward the solvent polarity. Lastly, the assembly showed enhanced catalytic properties compared to the parent POV.







Abstract
Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material for a given task.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient strategy for embedding catalytically active polyoxovanadate (POV) into supramolecular assemblies was developed by utilizing host-guest interactions between pillararenes grafted on the cluster and ditopic linkers. The amphiphilic nature of the POV in the host-guest complex promoted responsive behavior of the assembly toward the solvent polarity. Lastly, the assembly showed enhanced catalytic properties compared to the parent POV.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine-tune the properties of the material for a given task.

         <title>Photomodulated Transient Catalytic Constitutional Dynamic Networks and Reaction Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation of dynamic DNA circuits/networks is demonstrated by photoprotection of an auxiliary caged unit yielding an oligonucleotide intervening with the temporally operating circuits. This is exemplified with photomodulation of DNAzyme or of dynamically operating DNA networks. The concept is applied to photomodulated network&#8208;guided inhibition of fibrinogenesis and controlling biocatalytic cascades.







Abstract
A method to photomodulate dynamically transient DNA&#8208;based reaction circuits and networks is introduced. The method relies on the integration of photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;phosphate ester&#8208;caged DNA hairpin with a &#8220;mute&#8221; reaction module. Photodeprotection (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) of the hairpin structure separates a fuel strand triggering the dynamic, transient, operation of the DNA circuit/network. By temporal photocleavage of the hairpin within the course of transient operation of the circuit, photomodulation of the systems are demonstrated. The modulation amplitude and rhythms are controlled by the time&#8208;interval and cycle numbers of photo&#8208;deprotecting the hairpin structure. The method is applied to transiently photomodulate the catalytic activities of a DNAzyme, enabling the photomodulation of the transient assembly of a constitutional dynamic network (CDN) and the transient reconfiguration of the CDN framework. The different systems are supported by computational kinetic models allowing to predict, and experimentally validate, the behavior of the systems under variable auxiliary conditions. Moreover, the photomodulated transient CDNs are implemented as functional frameworks guiding the thrombin&#8208;catalyzed coagulation of fibrinogen to fibrin (fibrinogenesis) and photomodulated operation of a biocatalytic cascade.

         <title>A FRET Autophagy Imaging Platform by Macrocyclic Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the robust assembly and broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of macrocyclic amphiphiles, we developed a FRET&#8208;based autophagy imaging platform that demonstrates versatility and convenience as a powerful tool for imaging organelle autophagy.







Abstract
Autophagy is a ubiquitous process of organelle interaction in eukaryotic cells, in which various organelles or proteins are recycled and operated through the autophagy pathway to ensure nutrient and energy homeostasis. Although numerous fluorescent probes have been developed to image autophagy, these environment&#8208;responsive probes suffer from inherent deficiencies such as inaccuracy and limited versatility. Here, we present a modular macrocyclic amphiphile F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) platform (SC6A12C/NCM, SN), constructed through the amphiphilic assembly of sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SC6A12C) with N&#8208;cetylmorpholine (NCM) for lysosome targeting. The hydrophobic fluorophore BPEA (FRET donor) was entrapped within the inner hydrophobic phase and showed strong fluorescence emission. Attributed to the broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of SC6A12C, three commercially available organelle probes (Mito&#8208;Tracker Red, ER Tracker Red, and RhoNox&#8208;1) were selected as SC6A12C guests (FRET acceptors). During autophagy process, the formation of intracellular host&#8211;guest complexes leads to strong FRET signal, allowing us to visualize the fusion of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus with lysosomes, respectively. This study provides a versatile and accessible platform for imaging organelle autophagy.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructed Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Enabling Subzero Capacity Unlocking of Cost&#8208;Effective and Long&#8208;Life Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8197;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst is shown to enhance redox kinetics of V2+/V3+ and selectively inhibit hydrogen evolution side reaction, achieving stable operation over 1200&#8197;cycles and enabling subzero capacity unlocking for cost&#8208;effective vanadium flow batteries.







Abstract
Vanadium flow battery (VFB) promises a route for achieving grid&#8208;scale power storage by harnessing renewable energy sources. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples and serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still restrict the further development of VFB. Addressing these challenges requires not only effective solutions but also ones that are cost&#8208;efficient and scalable to meet the demands of affordable energy storage. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst by incorporating metal ions into the electrolyte. The Cu core, encapsulated by the Cu6Sn5 shell, forms an excellent conductive pathway to the graphite felt electrode. Charge transfer between Cu and Sn within Cu6Sn5 shell accelerates the reaction kinetics of V2+/V3+ redox couple and selectively inhibits HER, as confirmed through in&#8197;situ weak measurement imaging method. The Cu@Cu6Sn5 battery achieves a peak power density of 1119.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operates stably for 1200&#8197;cycles without catalyst failure, and is available over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Furthermore, we identify a demand of subzero capacity unlocking. Achieving a 23.4&#8201;% theoretical capacity unlocking at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 1.75&#8197;V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost&#8208;effective VFB.

Abstract
Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr&#8208;layered double hydroxide (RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units, in which low&#8208;loading Ru (0.32&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Rulds) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&#8722; repulsion by intercalated CO32&#8722; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units. The RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH&#8214;RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Employing RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73&#8201;% STH efficiency, corresponding photovoltaic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37&#8201;%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation&#8208;oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr-layered double hydroxide (Ru&lt;sub&gt;lds&lt;/sub&gt;NiCr-LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units, in which low-loading Ru (0.32&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Ru&lt;sub&gt;lds&lt;/sub&gt;) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; repulsion by intercalated CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units. The Ru&lt;sub&gt;lds&lt;/sub&gt;NiCr-LDH&#8214;Ru&lt;sub&gt;lds&lt;/sub&gt;NiCr-LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM-WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Employing Ru&lt;sub&gt;lds&lt;/sub&gt;NiCr-LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic-electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73&#8201;% STH efficiency, corresponding photovoltaic-to-hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37&#8201;%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation-oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of Ru&lt;sub&gt;lds&lt;/sub&gt;NiCr-LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adjacent&#8208;Ligand Tuning of Atomically Precise Cu&#8722;Pd Sites Enables Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation with a CO&#8208;Free Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

By introducing axial organic ligands to modify the atomically dispersed copper single atoms on the surface of Pd&#8208;metallene, we have constructed a catalyst with adjacent&#8208;ligand regulation effect to significantly enhance the catalytic performance of MOR.







Abstract
Whether the catalyst can realize the non&#8208;CO pathway is the key to greatly improve the catalytic activity and stability of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). It is feasible to optimize the reaction path selectivity by modifying organic ligands and constructing single&#8208;atom systems. At the same time, heterogeneous metal nanosheets with atomic thickness have been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of materials due to their ultra&#8208;high exposure of active sites and synergistic effects. Herein, we synthesize an ultra&#8208;thin heterogeneous alloy metallene with organic ligand&#8208;modified surface Cu single atom by one&#8208;pot wet chemical method, and further construct an efficient Cu&#8722;Pd active sites. The prepared octanoic acid ligand modified PdCu single&#8208;atom alloys metallene (SAA OA&#8722;Cu&#8208;Pdene) shows excellent catalytic activity and stability, with mass activity up to 5.64&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) up to 160.39&#8197;m2&#8201;gPd&#8722;1. Structural characterization and in situ experiment jointly indicate that ligand modulation brings about charge transfer, and the accompanying rapid migration of OH&#8722; greatly improves the selectivity of non&#8208;CO pathways while improving the catalytic activity. The results highlight the importance of adjacent&#8208;ligand regulation and provide a new strategy for the design of MOR catalysts with high selectivity of non&#8208;CO pathway.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Arene&#8208;Fused [n.1.1]&#8208;Bridged Molecules via Catalytic Cycloaddition and Rearrangement Reactions</title>

Boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of o&#8208;QMs or p&#8208;QMs with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in combination with selective Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements provides a collective approach for 6&#8197;types of medicinally attractive 2D/3D polycyclic compounds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] bridged scaffolds.







Abstract
Although great advancement has been made in synthesis of 3D bridged bicyclic[n.1.1]&#8208;bioisosteres, facile construction of 2D/3D merged molecules incorporating bridged rings, as novel chemical space in drug discovery, remains a significant challenge. Herein a collective, selective, and diversity&#8208;oriented approach for up to 6 types of 2D/3D polycyclic scaffolds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] substructure is reported. A boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed [2&#963;+2&#960;] cycloaddition between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and ortho&#8208;quinone methides afforded spirocyclic compounds containing a bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes unit, which were used as intermediates for synthesis of three types of 2D/3D scaffolds via judiciously controlled Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements. The reaction and rearrangement of para&#8208;quinone methides worked analogously and provided another two polycyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Chloride Residues in RuO2 Catalysts Enhance Its Stability and Efficiency for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 catalysts and pure RuO2 catalysts with comparable morphology and crystallinity were synthesized to clarify the effects of chlorine residues on the performance of RuO2. Notably, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability in acidic OER by lowering the limiting potential and suppressing the LOM pathway, maintaining high performance for over 1200&#8197;hours at high current densities.







Abstract
. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 (RuO2&#8208;Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2&#8208;Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum&#8208;coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.

         <title>Alloying Strategy Regulating Size and Electronic Structure of Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to Achieve High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by binary descriptors, 16 transition metal selenides are screened, and an alloying strategy is subsequently employed to controllably synthesize Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2/NG. This approach significantly reduces the surface energy while precisely tuning the band alignment and lattice matching between polysulfides and Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2/NG, thereby enhancing interfacial reaction kinetics and enabling the successful construction of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8722;&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of catalysts in lithium&#8722;&#8208;sulfur batteries has proven to be an efficacious avenue for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion. Specially, the size and electronic structure of catalysts play a pivotal role in harnessing the active sites and intrinsic catalysis activity. Outstanding MoSe2 and NbSe2 are were selected from 16 universal transition metal selenides based on the proposed binary descriptor. Then, an alloying strategy is was devised to prepare Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 flakelets for further improvement of the intrinsic catalysis. The integration of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that alloying Mo with Nb can regulate the surface energy and indexes of band match and lattice mismatch, thereby enabling Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to possess a small size, suitable adsorption energy and low reaction energy barrier. This optimization enhances the catalysis of sulfur reduction/evolution reaction and the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium. Consequently, an assembled Ah&#8208;level pouch cell is realized with dramatic cycle stability. With the electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.36&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8201;S&#8722;1, the cell can deliver a high energy density of up to 505.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1. This work pioneers a universal strategy for sculpting the geometric configurations and electronic structures of catalysts, to achieve enhanced catalytic activity and precise interpretation of structure&#8211;activity relationships.

Then, an alloying strategy is was devised to prepare Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakelets for further improvement of the intrinsic catalysis. The integration of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that alloying Mo with Nb can regulate the surface energy and indexes of band match and lattice mismatch, thereby enabling Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to possess a small size, suitable adsorption energy and low reaction energy barrier. This optimization enhances the catalysis of sulfur reduction/evolution reaction and the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium. Consequently, an assembled Ah-level pouch cell is realized with dramatic cycle stability. With the electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.36&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8201;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the cell can deliver a high energy density of up to 505.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work pioneers a universal strategy for sculpting the geometric configurations and electronic structures of catalysts, to achieve enhanced catalytic activity and precise interpretation of structure&#8211;activity relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 Electrocatalyst for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process results in the low conversion efficiency of NO3RR. Selenium&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 heterojunction is synthesized. The Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2 contributes to nitrate&#8208;deoxidation and hydrogenation, and Fe3O4 promotes water decomposition to provide H protons, which jointly promotes NO3RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8722; is a green and sustainable method that not only helps to treat industrial pollutants in wastewater, but also produces valuable chemicals. However, the slow dynamics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process results in a high barrier and low conversion efficiency. In this work, the Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 heterojunction was synthesized, which showed excellent electrochemical performance in 0.1&#8197;M nitrate reduction reaction, superior to most currently reported catalysts. The high activity of Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 is due to the synergistic effect between FeSe2 and Fe3O4 to achieve relay catalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. Among them, the Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2 contributes to NO3&#8722; deoxygenation and subsequent hydrogenation, and Fe3O4 promotes H2O decomposition to provide H proton, jointly promote NO3RR. Finally, the online differential electrochemical mass spectra (DEMS), in&#8197;situ Raman and DFT calculation confirmed the optimal pathway for NO3RR to NH3 on Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4(100). This strategy of relay catalysis provides a potential way to treat wastewater with high concentration nitrate.

The optimization of one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence through linker installation in an interpenetrated TPE&#8208;MOF. Both the crystal packing density and ligand conformations can be modulated by linker installation.







Abstract
Immobilizing organic chromophores within the rigid framework of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) augments fluorescence by effectively curtailing molecular motions. Yet, the substantial interspaces and free volumes inherent to MOFs can undermine photoluminescence efficiency, as they partially constrain intramolecular dynamics. In this study, we achieved optimization of both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence by incorporating linkers into an interpenetrated tetraphenylethene&#8208;based MOF (TPE&#8208;MOF). This linker installation strategy enables fine&#8208;tuning of both crystal packing density and ligand conformations. Strikingly, the desolvated MOFs exhibit remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections, reaching an impressive 8801&#8197;GM. Consequently, these materials demonstrate exceptional performance in one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited cellular imaging of HepG2 cells. Our work introduces an innovative approach to enhancing two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and broadens the scope of research into one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (1/2 PEF).

         <title>Decoupling H2 and O2 Release in Particulate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Using a Reversible O2 Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt) consisting of photoresponsive chip (HPCN), H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 ([Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+) is constructed to achieve the decoupling of particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes oxidize [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ into [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ and H+, while the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt through rGO for reduction of H+ to H2. Under visible irradiation, [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ is photolyzed back to [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ along with O2 evolution.







Abstract
H2 and O2 evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three&#8208;component photocatalyst, Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Enantioselective Hydropyridylation of Dienes for the Synthesis of Chiral Diaryl Compounds via Concerted Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and 1,4&#8208;selective hydropyridylation has been developed. Using 2&#8208;fluoropyridine as the electrophile and a copper catalyst in conjunction with (R)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP, the desired chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl product was synthesized via a concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds, particularly those containing a pyridine moiety, is of significant interest due to their pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hydropyridylation of conjugated dienes. Utilizing 2&#8208;fluoropyridine as the electrophile, CuOAc, and the chiral ligand Tol&#8208;BINAP, we optimized reaction conditions to achieve the desired chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl products containing both a pyridine and a cis&#8208;crotyl group. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the 1,2&#8208;hydrocupration step is enantio&#8208;determining, and the concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution proceeds via six&#8208;membered cyclic transition states.

Using 2-fluoropyridine as the electrophile and a copper catalyst in conjunction with (R)-Tol-BINAP, the desired chiral 1,1-diaryl product was synthesized via a concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of chiral 1,1-diaryl compounds, particularly those containing a pyridine moiety, is of significant interest due to their pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report the development of a copper-catalyzed enantioselective 1,4-hydropyridylation of conjugated dienes. Utilizing 2-fluoropyridine as the electrophile, CuOAc, and the chiral ligand Tol-BINAP, we optimized reaction conditions to achieve the desired chiral 1,1-diaryl products containing both a pyridine and a cis-crotyl group. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the 1,2-hydrocupration step is enantio-determining, and the concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution proceeds via six-membered cyclic transition states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Preferential Cleavage of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bonds in Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes decorated with Ni&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atoms is constructed for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The active *OH makes the GOR follow a direct oxidation pathway occurring at lower potentials. The optimized electronic state of Co single&#8208;atom regulated by Ni single&#8208;atom and Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy promotes *OH&#8208;mediated preferential cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds, leading to a high formate yield.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) to produce high&#8208;value formic acid (FA) is hindered by high formation potential of active species and sluggish C&#8722;C bond cleavage kinetics. Herein, Ni single&#8208;atom (NiSA) and Co single&#8208;atom (CoSA) dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy (Ni0.1Co0.9@NiSACoSA&#8208;NCNTs) are constructed for electrochemical GOR. Remarkably, it can reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of 1.15&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and realize a high formate selectivity of 93.27&#8201;% even at high glycerol conversion of 98.81&#8201;% at 1.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The GOR mechanism and pathway are systematically elucidated via experimental analyses and theoretical calculations. It is revealed that the active hydroxyl (*OH) can be produced during the GOR. The NiSA, CoSA, and Ni0.1Co0.9 synergistically optimizes the electronic structure of CoSA active sites, reducing the energy barriers of *OH&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds and dehydrogenation of C1 intermediates. This decreases the number of reaction intermediates and reaction steps of GOR&#8208;to&#8208;FA, thus increasing the formate production efficiency. After coupling GOR with hydrogen evolution reaction in a membrane electrode assembly cell, 14.26&#8197;g of formate and 23.10&#8197;L of H2 are produced at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 108&#8197;h.

         <title>Charge Manipulation of Porous Coordination Cages Tunes the Efficiency and Selectivity in Electrochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge species of the porous coordination cages are regulated by ligand strategy. The charge&#8208;tunable porous coordination cages exhibit performance tweaking ability in the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, which can not only indirectly adjust the efficiency of nitrate electrosynthesis of ammonia, but also modulate the product selectivity of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals has been attracting growing interest owing to its environmentally benign reaction pathways. Among these processes, the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3), known as NO3RR, and the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) stand out as two cornerstone reactions; yet, their efficiency and selectivity pose ongoing challenges. In this study, we introduce a charge manipulation approach for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts tailored for the simultaneous coupling of NO3RR and HMFOR. We have synthesized a range of porous coordination cages (PCCs) that share the same topology and Co/Ni metal centers but incorporate different charged moieties, imparting them with distinct surface net charges. Electrocatalytic evaluations revealed that PCC&#8208;Co demonstrated a voltage&#8208;dependent activity in NO3RR. Conversely, PCC&#8208;Ni exhibited a precisely adjustable product selectivity in HMFOR, contingent upon the cage&#8216;s charge state. In situ analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations underscored the profound impact of catalyst charge on the differential adsorption of reaction intermediates and the lowest free energy change (&#916;G) during the pivotal reaction step, resulting in alterations to both activity and selectivity. These discoveries provide invaluable insights into the &#8220;structure&#8208;performance relationship&#8221; of NO3RR/HMFOR catalysts, highlighting PCCs as promising contenders for advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Lithiophilic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymer Modified Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was obtained and modified onto polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the lithiophilic triazine units, this ArMT@PP simplifies the solvation structure of Li+, facilitates the migration of Li+ and forms a stable solid electrolyte interface. The assembled LMBs achieved a capacity retention of 90.58&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
As traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries near their theoretical limits, the advancement of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) becomes crucial for achieving higher energy densities. However, uncontrolled ion transport and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer are key factors inducing lithium dendrite growth, hindering the development of LMBs. Separator modification is an effective strategy to address the challenges of LMBs. To tackle the issues, a donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was successfully synthesized and modified onto commercial polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for LMBs. Benefitting from the highly lithiophilic triazine organic units, this ArMT exhibits affinity towards Li+ and simplifies the solvation structure of Li+ during the diffusion process, thus decreasing the ion diffusion activation energy, thereby accelerating the migration of Li+. Furthermore, triazine organic units with appropriate pore size regulate the plating/stripping behavior of lithium metal anodes, thereby facilitating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. As a result, the assembled Li|ArMT@PP|Li symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping over 800&#8197;h. Moreover, the LiFePO4|ArMT@PP|Li cells achieved excellent cycling stability with 127.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 90.58&#8201;%. This design strategy ensures a durable and dendrite&#8208;free anode and paves the way for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Antiaromatic Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage oxidation of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene regioisomers to their corresponding sulfones affords rationally designed molecules with varying degrees of donor/acceptor characteristics and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Depending on the fusion orientation of the donors and acceptors, the two most antiaromatic, oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30&#8211;40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of four donor/acceptor&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacenes via the late&#8208;stage oxidation of a family of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene&#8208;s&#8208;indacene regioisomers. A thorough study of their properties through experimental and computational analysis has revealed the effect of asymmetry on the molecular properties associated with antiaromaticity, as well as a strong correlation between antiaromaticity and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The strength of the charge transfer depends on the fusion orientation of the donor and acceptor motifs relative to the s&#8208;indacene core. The two most antiaromatic oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30 and 40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.

&lt;p&gt;Late-stage oxidation of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene-fused &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene regioisomers to their corresponding sulfones affords rationally designed molecules with varying degrees of donor/acceptor characteristics and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Depending on the fusion orientation of the donors and acceptors, the two most antiaromatic, oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30&#8211;40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of four donor/acceptor-fused &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacenes via the late-stage oxidation of a family of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene regioisomers. A thorough study of their properties through experimental and computational analysis has revealed the effect of asymmetry on the molecular properties associated with antiaromaticity, as well as a strong correlation between antiaromaticity and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The strength of the charge transfer depends on the fusion orientation of the donor and acceptor motifs relative to the &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene core. The two most antiaromatic oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30 and 40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Alcohols Electrooxidation Coupled with Hydrogen Production via Asymmetric Pulse Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy was developed to promote the regeneration of active oxygen species which contribute to satble catalysis by noble metal catalysts for various alcohol oxidation reactions. Distinguished from conventional potentiostatic strategy, the operation time of stable glycerol oxidation electrocatalyzed by Pd was extended from 6&#8197;h to more than 2800&#8197;h under universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic organic oxidation coupled with hydrogen (H2) production emerges as a profitable solution to simultaneously reduce overall energy consumption of H2 production and synthetic high&#8208;value chemicals. Noble metal catalysts are highly efficient electrocatalysts in oxidation reactions, but they deactivate easily weakening the benefit in actual production. Herein, we report a universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy to achieve long&#8208;term stable operation of noble metals for various alcohol oxidation reactions and noble metal catalysts. For example, by pulsed potentials between 0.8&#8197;V and 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, palladium (Pd)&#8208;catalyzed glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation can continuously proceed for more than 2800&#8197;h with glyceric acid (GLA) selectivity of &gt;70&#8201;%. Whereas, Pd electrocatalyst becomes nearly deactivated within 6&#8197;h of reaction under conventional potentiostatic strategy. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated electrophilic OH* from H2O/OH&#8722; oxidation on Pd (denoted as Pd&#8722;OH*) acts as main active species for GLY oxidation. However, Pd&#8722;OH* is prone to be oxidized to PdOx resulting in performance decay. When a short reduction potential (e.g., 0&#8197;V vs. RHE for 5&#8197;s) is powered, PdOx can be reversibly reduced to restore the current. Moreover, we tested the feasibility of this strategy in a flow electrolyzer, verifying the practical application potential.

         <title>CO2 Reduction at a Borane&#8208;Modified Iron Complex: A Secondary Coordination Sphere Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bifunctional {Fe&#8208;H/Cp*&#8208;BCy2} (Cp* = C5Me5&#8722;) complex, which includes both iron&#8208;hydride and Lewis acid (borane) components, we demonstrate controlled CO2 reactivity to yield a formoxy borane&#8208;bound ferra(II)lactone [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5&#8208;CH2&#8208;CO2(BCy2O2CH))FeII(diphosphine)] that incorporates two equivalents of reduced CO2. With excess HBCy2, we additionally establish catalytic dihydroboration of CO2 to produce the bis&#8208;acetal, Cy2BOCH2OBCy2 at room temperature (TON = 220&#8197;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5&#8722;) &#8211; a well&#8208;studied family of organometallic complex &#8211; as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*&#8208;BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for transforming CO2 to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]. Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2 emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable &#8211; with such borane&#8208;containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal&#8208;ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.

         <title>Autocatalytic Nucleation and Self&#8208;Assembly of Inorganic Nanoparticles into Complex Biosimilar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoparticles multiply via autocatalytic nucleation. They also subsequently self&#8208;assemble into percolating chains via spatially restricted attachment. Structural analysis using graph theory (GT) reveals biomimetic organizational patterns akin to those found in biofilms. GT descriptors suggest a fundamental similarity in the mechanisms driving the emergence of complexity in both biological and abiological systems.







Abstract
Self&#8208;replication of bioorganic molecules and oil microdroplets have been explored as models in prebiotic chemistry. An analogous process for inorganic nanomaterials would involve the autocatalytic nucleation of metal, semiconductor, or ceramic nanoparticles&#8208;an area that remains largely uncharted. Demonstrating such systems would be both fundamentally intriguing and practically relevant, especially if the resulting particles self&#8208;assemble into complex structures beyond the capabilities of molecules or droplets. Here, we show that autocatalytic nucleation occurs with silver nanoparticles, which subsequently self&#8208;assemble into chains through spatially restricted attachment. In dispersions containing &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles, these reactions produce complex colloids with hierarchical spike organization. On solid surfaces, autocatalytic nucleation of nanoparticles yields conformal networks with hierarchical organization, including nanoparticle &#8220;colonies.&#8221; We analyzed the complexity of both types of solid&#8208;stabilized particle assemblies via graph theory (GT). The complexity index of idealized spiky colloids is comparable to that of complex algal skeletons. The GT analysis of the percolating nanoparticle networks revealed their similarities to the bacterial, but not fungal, biofilms. We conclude that coupling autocatalytic nucleation with self&#8208;assembly enables the generation of complex, biosimilar particles and films. This work establishes mathematical and structural parallels between biotic and abiotic matter, integrating self&#8208;organization, autocatalytic nucleation, and theoretical description of complex systems. Utilization of quantitative descriptors of connectivity patterns opens possibility to GT&#8208;based biomimetic engineering of conductive coatings and other complex nanostructures.

         <title>Constructing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Oxidative Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that demonstrate exceptional efficiency in H2O2 photosynthesis, coupled with the selective oxidation of organic molecules. These COFs have set a new benchmark for H2O2 production, achieving one of the highest performances reported to date. Additionally, they exhibit remarkable selectivity and yield in the oxidation of various organic substrates. This work represents a significant breakthrough in the development of COF&#8208;based photocatalytic platforms for dual&#8208;function co&#8208;production systems.







Abstract
The development of photocatalytic systems that enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 and value&#8208;added organic chemicals presents a dual advantage: generating valuable products while maximizing the utilization of solar energy. Despite the potential, there are relatively few reports on photocatalysts capable of such dual functions. In this study, we synthesized a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as JUC&#8208;675 to JUC&#8208;677, to explore their photocatalytic efficiency in the co&#8208;production of H2O2 and N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine (BBAD). Among them, JUC&#8208;675 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 22.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 15.7&#8201;%, and its solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency was calculated to be 1.09&#8201;%, marking it as the most effective COF&#8208;based photocatalyst reported to date. Additionally, JUC&#8208;675 demonstrated a high selectivity (99.9&#8201;%) and yield (96&#8201;%) for BBAD in the oxidative coupling of benzylamine. The underlying reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated through validation experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

     alt="Constructing Donor-Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Oxidative Organic Transformations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a series of donor-acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that demonstrate exceptional efficiency in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis, coupled with the selective oxidation of organic molecules. These COFs have set a new benchmark for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, achieving one of the highest performances reported to date. Additionally, they exhibit remarkable selectivity and yield in the oxidation of various organic substrates. This work represents a significant breakthrough in the development of COF-based photocatalytic platforms for dual-function co-production systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of photocatalytic systems that enable the simultaneous production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and value-added organic chemicals presents a dual advantage: generating valuable products while maximizing the utilization of solar energy. Despite the potential, there are relatively few reports on photocatalysts capable of such dual functions. In this study, we synthesized a series of donor-acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as JUC-675 to JUC-677, to explore their photocatalytic efficiency in the co-production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N-benzylbenzaldimine (BBAD). Among them, JUC-675 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 22.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an apparent quantum yield of 15.7&#8201;%, and its solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency was calculated to be 1.09&#8201;%, marking it as the most effective COF-based photocatalyst reported to date. Additionally, JUC-675 demonstrated a high selectivity (99.9&#8201;%) and yield (96&#8201;%) for BBAD in the oxidative coupling of benzylamine. The underlying reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated through validation experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of COF-based photocatalysts and the development of efficient dual-function photocatalytic platforms, offering new insights and methodologies for enhanced solar energy utilization and the synthesis of value-added products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unconventional Heterobidentate Coordination of 4&#8208;Hydroxypyridine Leading to Remarkably Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Zn(C5H4NO)2</title>

Unusual heterobidentate coordination generates a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2, which shows a uniform alignment of microscopic polarization that generates the record&#8208;high bulk SHG among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unconventional heterobidentate coordination mode of conventional 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand in a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2. The strong heterobidentate coordination interactions between Zn2+ and 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands promote a uniform alignment of the polarization of each [ZnO2N2] tetrahedral building unit, resulting in remarkably strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) with an intensity that is the largest among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds reaching 13.6&#215;KDP. Moreover, Zn(C5H4NO)2 processes a suitable optical band gap of 4.40&#8197;eV, high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, excellent air stability, and strong water resistance, demonstrating great application potential. Additionally, Zn(C5H4NO)2 exhibits photoluminescence with a significantly enhanced lifetime of 558&#8197;ms, accompanied by a rare blue afterglow visible to the naked eye, lasting up to 5&#8197;s.

         <title>Non&#8208;Radical Mediated Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Conjugate&#8208;Enhanced Phenolic Resins with Ultrafast Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur&#8208;infused phenolic (RS) resin photocatalyst was meticulously designed at the molecular level to fine&#8208;tune its conjugation degree, thereby enhancing both its charge separation capability and hydrophilicity. This structural optimization enables the RS resin to achieve overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via non&#8208;radical pathways, resulting in an outstanding solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
It is essential for the development of highly efficient polymeric photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Nevertheless, the non&#8208;uniform molecular structures and sluggish reaction pathway of polymeric photocatalysts lead to low conversion efficiency. In this work, we report sulfur&#8208;contained phenolic resins with regulated conjugation for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Due to the substitution of sulfur for methylene in the phenolic resin structure, the conjugation degree of the material is adjusted, resulting in the formation of a built&#8208;in electric field. This effectively enhances the charge separation capability, enabling charge carriers to react faster with substrates. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we have unveiled that the introduction of sulfur can modulate the reaction pathway of phenolic resin materials, enabling a dual&#8208;pathway photocatalytic H2O2 production mediated by non&#8208;radical species. Impressively, the sulfur&#8208;contained resin photocatalyst showcases exceptional H2O2 production activity with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4&#8201;% exceeding most reported systems, and generates 25&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 of H2O2 under natural sunlight through large&#8208;scale equipment. This work provides a facile strategy to separate the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs of polymer photocatalysts to achieve efficient artificial photosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A novel approach to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extraction from liquid organic hydrocarbon carriers (LOHCs) using ultralow loading of Pt nanoparticles on a modified alumina structure with an ALD-titanium oxide shell is shown by Yongmin Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202417598"&gt;e202417598&lt;/a&gt;). This unique catalyst design efficiently releases hydrogen from LOHCs, outperforming equivalent Pt and commercial catalysts. The ALD-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell enhances the catalytic activity while minimizing Pt usage.

Abstract
Br&#248;nsted photoacids and photobases are a unique class of molecules that undergo a major change in their pKa values between their ground and excited states, resulting in donating or accepting a proton, respectively, but only after light excitation. This property of photoacids/photobases makes them an attractive tool for light&#8208;gating various dynamic processes. Here, we review the use of this property to manipulate functional dynamic systems with light. We discuss how a proton transfer event that can happen upon light excitation from a photoacid to a chemical moiety of a certain system or, vice versa, from the system to a photobase, can result in a shift in the equilibrium of the system, resulting in some dynamicity. We detail various systems, including self&#8208;assembly processes of nanostructures, self&#8208;propulsion of droplets, catalysis for hydrogen evolution or CO2 capturing, nanotechnological devices based on enzymatic processes, and changes in proton&#8208;conducting ionophores and materials. We detail the basic guidelines for using Br&#248;nsted photoacids and photobases in a desired system and conclude with the current technological gaps in further using these molecules.

This review highlights recent developments and trends in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by visible light photocatalysis. It discusses a variety of radical decarboxylative and deoxygenative coupling reactions, with particular emphasis on the reaction mechanisms involved, as well as potential future directions for the field.







Abstract
The simple and efficient conversion of carboxylic acids into structurally diverse organic molecules is highly desirable in chemical synthesis. This review covers recent developments in photocatalytic methodology for late&#8208;stage transformations of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by radical decarboxylation and deoxygenation, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advancements are categorized based on the reactivity patterns exhibited by the carboxylic acids. Several activation modes to generate alkyl or aryl radical intermediates during decarboxylation of carboxylic acids are presented, namely, single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), SET reduction, and energy transfer (EnT) processes. On the other hand, direct activation of C&#8722;O bonds in carboxylic acids mediated by phosphoranyl radicals has been discussed and illustrates their potential synthetic application for the synthesis of complex aldehydes, ketones and amides.

Fasten your seat belt! Choose lightning&#8208;speed, photoactivated journeys for complexes by selecting the metal, its oxidation state, ligands and geometry. Track complexes through excited singlet (S) states, intersystem crossing (ISC) to triplet (T) states, energy/charge&#8208;transfer, luminescence, ligand substitutions and redox reactions. Pathways to novel drugs with new mechanisms of action. Unravelling excited metallomics on the way is challenging.







Abstract
Photoactivatable metal complexes offer the prospect of novel drugs with low side effects and new mechanisms of action to combat resistance to current therapy. We highlight recent progress in the design of platinum, ruthenium, iridium, gold and other transition metal complexes, especially for applications as anticancer and anti&#8208;infective agents. In particular, understanding excited state chemistry related to identification of the bioactive species (excited state metallomics/pharmacophores) is important. Photoactivatable metallodrugs are classified here as photocatalysts, photorelease agents and ligand&#8208;activated agents. Their activation wavelengths, cellular mechanisms of action, experimental and theoretical metallomics of excited states and photoproducts are discussed to explore new strategies for the design and investigation of photoactivatable metallodrugs. These photoactivatable metallodrugs have potential in clinical applications of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), Photoactivated Chemotherapy (PACT) and Photothermal Therapy (PTT).

         <title>Deciphering Polymer Interactions in Bioconjugates with Different Architectures by Structural Analysis via Time&#8208;Resolved Limited Proteolysis Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative time&#8208;resolved limited proteolysis (LiP) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to decipher interferon alpha 2a (IFN) interactions using &#8220;heavy&#8221; 15N&#8208;IFN wild type as an internal standard. We monitor tryptic cleavage dynamics of specific protein&#8208;protein interactions and transient non&#8208;specific polymer&#8208;protein interactions (IFN&#8208;bioconjugates) with different polymer architectures and click handles. LIP&#8208;MS may result in an enhanced future understanding of transient interactions&#8208;landscapes of bioconjugates.







Abstract
Therapeutic proteins are commonly conjugated with polymers to modulate their pharmacokinetics but often lack a description of the polymer&#8208;protein interaction. We deployed limited proteolysis mass spectrometry (LiP&#8208;MS) to reveal the interaction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PEG alternative polymers with interferon&#8208;&#945;2a (IFN). Target conjugates were digested with the specific protease trypsin and a &#8220;heavy&#8221; 15N&#8208;IFN wild type (IFN&#8208;WT) for time&#8208;resolved quantification of the cleavage dynamics. Interactions between IFN&#8208;&#945;2a and its high&#8208;affinity receptor were detailed by LiP&#8208;MS. Then, 10&#8197;kDa polymers of PEG, linear polyglycerol (LPG), and poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) (POX) with two different cyclooctyne linkers (BCN/DBCO) were used for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation to azide functionalized IFN&#8208;&#945;2a. Tryptic events at each cleavage site and in different structural environments (loops/helices) were compared. PEG and LPG were similar, and POX showed a reduced interaction profile with the IFN&#8208;&#945;2a surface. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations of IFN&#8208;DBCO&#8208;polymer conjugates revealed distinct and transient (below 50&#8197;ns) protein&#8208;interaction profiles for PEG, LPG, and POX. Cleavage dynamics of IFN&#8208;polymer conjugates from the BCN handle were homogeneous, pointing to a more conserved IFN structure than DBCO&#8208;polymer conjugates. In summary, time&#8208;resolved LiP&#8208;MS for quantification of cleavage events enhances the structural understanding of transient IFN&#8208;polymer interactions, which may be extended to other bioconjugate types.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a selenium&#8208;substitution strategy, a new selenium&#8208;based ligand, tetraseleno&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ), was synthesized, leading to the construction of a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer (Ag4TSHQ). Ag4TSHQ shares the same topological structure as its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ, but exhibits superior charge mobility of approximately 350&#8197;cm2/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of Ag4TTHQ. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced electrochemical energy storage capabilities. This research underscores the advantages of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) in optoelectronic devices and energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs), a novel class of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron&#8208;rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high&#8208;mobility semiconducting c&#8208;CPs. Despite their potential, c&#8208;CPs incorporating selenium&#8208;substituted ligands remain scarce due to the synthetic challenges associated with both the ligands and the coordination polymers. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraselenol&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer, Ag4TSHQ. Ag4TSHQ exhibits room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6&#8197;S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag4TTHQ (TTHQ=tetrathiol&#8208;hydroxyquinone), enabling precise band gap modulation from 0.6&#8197;eV to 1.5&#8197;eV via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. Time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag4TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag4TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340&#8197;F/g&#8208;significantly outperforming Ag4TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294&#8197;F/g. These findings underscore the potential of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs for optoelectronic applications and energy storage technologies.

         <title>Rapid N2O Formation from N2 on Water Droplet Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen (N2) is regarded as a stable reservoir for the N element in the atmosphere. However, this study finds that the stable N2 can rapidly react with atmospheric oxygen and ozone on ubiquitous water droplet surfaces via a novel reduction&#8208;then&#8208;oxidation pathway, resulting in the formation of nitrous oxide &#8211; the third most impactful greenhouse gas.







Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) has long been considered as stable atmospheric reservoir for N element and has a persistence time of hundreds of years. This study reveals that oxygen (O2) at typical tropospheric concentrations can rapidly activate N2, leading to substantial production of nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most impactful greenhouse gas, at rates approaching 2.83&#177;0.41 ppmv hour&#8722;1 catalyzed by ubiquitous water droplets in experimental systems. Notably, ozone (O3), typically consumed by N2O in the stratosphere, can further accelerate N2O formation. In contrast, the produced N2O concentration is below detection limits in the absence of O2/O3 or water droplets. A novel reduction&#8208;then&#8208;oxidation (RTO) mechanism was proposed to account for the rapid formation of N2O on the water droplet surfaces facilitated by the cooperation of water droplets and O2/O3. Further extrapolation indicates that the RTO pathway contributes several Tg N N2O annually, far exceeding the most known sources of N2O. These findings have broad implications for tracing atmospheric N2O sources, enhancing understanding of climate&#8208;O2/O3 interactions, and paving avenues for developing new methodologies for N2O synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is regarded as a stable reservoir for the N element in the atmosphere. However, this study finds that the stable N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can rapidly react with atmospheric oxygen and ozone on ubiquitous water droplet surfaces via a novel reduction-then-oxidation pathway, resulting in the formation of nitrous oxide &#8211; the third most impactful greenhouse gas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has long been considered as stable atmospheric reservoir for N element and has a persistence time of hundreds of years. This study reveals that oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at typical tropospheric concentrations can rapidly activate N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to substantial production of nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the third most impactful greenhouse gas, at rates approaching 2.83&#177;0.41 ppmv hour&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; catalyzed by ubiquitous water droplets in experimental systems. Notably, ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), typically consumed by N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the stratosphere, can further accelerate N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O formation. In contrast, the produced N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O concentration is below detection limits in the absence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or water droplets. A novel reduction-then-oxidation (RTO) mechanism was proposed to account for the rapid formation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on the water droplet surfaces facilitated by the cooperation of water droplets and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Further extrapolation indicates that the RTO pathway contributes several Tg N N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O annually, far exceeding the most known sources of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

         <title>Identification of Oligosaccharide Isomers Using Electrostatically Asymmetric OmpF Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, the OmpF nanopore, was developed for detecting unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides at low concentrations.







Abstract
Glycans, unlike uniformly charged DNA and compositionally diverse peptides, are typically uncharged and possess rich stereoisomeric diversity in the glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharide units. These unique features, including charge heterogeneity and structural complexity, pose significant challenges for accurate analysis. Herein, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, OmpF nanopore. The natural electroosmotic flow within OmpF generates a robust driving force for unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides, enabling detection at a concentration as low as 6.4&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the asymmetric constriction zone of OmpF was employed to construct a stereoselective recognition site, enabling sensitive identification of glycosidic bond differences in cell lysate samples. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the OmpF nanopore achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.9&#8201;% for tetrasaccharides differing in only one glycosidic bond was achieved. This nanopore sensor provides a highly sensitive analytical tool with a broad dynamic range. It enables chiral recognition of oligosaccharides at low concentrations and is suitable for analysing both low&#8208;abundance and practical samples.

         <title>A Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Approach to Isotactic Alternating Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust regio&#8208; and stereoselective ROP approach was developed for the synthesis of isoenriched alt&#8208;PLGA (Regioselectivity up to 97&#8201;%, Pm up to 0.91) from rac&#8208;MG by the exploit of our spiro&#8208;salen scandium complexes, which represents a versatile platform for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability.







Abstract
Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed for various biomedical applications owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. The discovery of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric alternating PLGA pairs underscored its potential as high&#8208;performance biodegradable materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability. Herein, we have established a regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach for the synthesis of stereocomplexed isoenriched alternating PLGA from racemic methyl&#8208;glycolide (rac&#8208;MG). The high sequence and tacticity control was accomplished by an optimized enantiopure scandium catalyst bearing a spiro&#8208;salen scaffold. Varying polymer stereoregularity Pm from 0.4 to 0.91 led to a transformation of the resulting alternating PLGA from amorphous to semicrystalline materials. Notably, the stereocomplexed alternating PLGA demonstrated enhanced melting transition temperature (Tm up to 191&#8201;&#176;C) and crystallization rate. This regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled polymerization represented a versatile approach for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials.

         <title>Precise Identification of Native Peptides with Posttranslational Proline Hydroxylation by Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally engineered nanopore was constructed to directly discriminate posttranslational proline hydroxylation in native peptides. By modeling the specific binding structure, hydrophobic region was introduced into aerolysin to transduce the hydrophobicity difference induced by hydroxylation. Precise identification of proline hydroxylation in hypoxia&#8208;induced factor protein was achieved without interference from adjacent oxidation.







Abstract
Hydroxylation, an extensive post&#8208;translational modification on proline, is critical for the modulation of native protein structures, further dominating their functions in life systems. However, current mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based identification, could hardly distinguish hydroxylation with the neighboring oxidation due to the same mass shifts, as well as challenges posed by low abundance and exogenous oxidation during sample preparation. To address this, an engineered nanopore was designed, capable of discriminating single hydroxyl group on proline, to achieve the identification of proline hydroxylation on individual native peptides directly in mixture. By modeling the interaction between hydroxylated proline and its specific recognition protein, we introduced a hydrophobic region in aerolysin lumen with A224Y/T274W mutations to enhance the sensitivity for proline residue. The results showed that the proline hydroxylation on native HIF&#8208;1&#945; fragments could be unambiguously identified without purification, which could be maintained even in the presence of neighboring oxidation. The voltage&#8208;dependent experiments further demonstrated the more relaxed peptide structure induced by hydroxylation that supported the great impact of hydroxylation on chemical properties of proline and the molecular mechanism of the specific recognition for hydroxylated proline in nature. These findings highlight the potential of nanopore for precise hydroxylation detection, offering a reliable platform for further uncovering the related functions in biological systems.

         <title>Enantioselective Trifluoromethylazidation of Styrenyl Olefins Catalyzed by an Engineered Nonheme Iron Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic platform for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes has been successfully established. Through 11 rounds of directed evolution, an engineered variant of nonheme iron enzyme, BsQueD&#8208;CF3, was developed, enabling the production of a wide range of enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing molecules. This platform based on metalloenzymes would open a new avenue for biocatalytic trifluoromethylation chemistry.







Abstract
Organofluorines, particularly those containing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, play a critical role in medicinal chemistry. While trifluoromethylation of alkenes provides a powerful synthetic route to construct CF3&#8208;containing compounds with broad structural and functional diversity, achieving enantioselective control in these reactions remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we engineered a nonheme iron enzyme, quercetin 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsQueD), for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes. Through directed evolution, the final variant BsQueD&#8208;CF3 exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of radical intermediates. This work expands biocatalytic organofluorine chemistry by reprogramming metalloenzymes for innovative trifluoromethylation reactions.

         <title>A Trithia&#8208;Bridged N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: The Hitherto Missing Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented triphenylamine with three sulfur ortho bridges has been developed as the very first representative of the hitherto elusive family of electron donors. The compound is readily oxidized to the corresponding radical cation with exceptional stability and forms crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with cyano&#8208;based acceptors.







Abstract
The very first representative of trithia&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene, a triphenylamine with sulfur atoms bridging the ortho&#8208;positions, was synthesized by a sequence of regioselective sulfenylation with phthalimidesulfenyl chloride followed by Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the polycyclic scaffold. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the optoelectronic properties. The title compound is a particularly strong electron donor forming a perfectly stable radical cation, which was analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron donor properties were further highlighted by the formation of crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors.

         <title>Secupyritines A&#8208;C, Three Natural Propellane Securinega Alkaloids: Structure Elucidation and Total Synthesis Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel polycyclic pyridine alkaloids (1&#8208;3) featuring a unique 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;6&#8208;aza[4.4.3]propellane skeleton were discovered from the twigs and leaves of Flueggea suffruticosa. Guided by a synthesis strategy based on the biogenetic building blocks, the first total synthesis of 1&#8208;3 was achieved through vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reaction, Suzuki coupling reaction, and intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction as key steps.







Abstract
Secupyritines A&#8208;C are unique polycyclic Securinega alkaloids isolated from medicinal plant Flueggea suffruticosa. They feature a distinctive 6/6/6/5/6 fused pentacyclic ring system with a highly strained 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;6&#8208;aza[4.4.3]propellane core. Their structures with absolute configurations were elucidated through a comprehensive approach involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and total synthesis. The total synthesis of secupyritines A&#8208;C was achieved in 14 or 16 steps, employing a synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks. Key elements of the synthetic procedures include a vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reaction to construct the sp3&#8208;sp2 attached&#8208;ring system, a Suzuki coupling reaction to build the piperidine ring, and an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction to establish the propellane skeleton. Formal asymmetric synthesis of secupyritines A&#8208;C was also presented.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides Directed by a Removable, Backbone&#8208;Inserted Amidoxime Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides has been developed, directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. The backbone&#8208;installed directing group facilitates site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides, including at internal residues. Removal of the amidoxime ether generates the parent amide enabling a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted considerable attention as a pathway to late&#8208;stage modification of peptides. Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including unprecedented functionalization of internal residues of native peptides. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.

         <title>Design of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Domain Antibodies via a Genetically Encoded &#946;&#8208;Lactam Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;lysine (BeLaK) enables a spontaneous inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with a proximal lysine in a supercharged monobody, affording a rigidified cell&#8208;penetrating variant with enhanced thermostability, greater cellular uptake, and potent inhibitory activity.







Abstract
Domain antibodies such as monobodies provide an attractive immunoglobin fold for evolving high&#8208;affinity protein binders targeting the intracellular proteins implicated in cell signalling. However, it remains a challenge to endow cell permeability to these small and versatile protein binders. Here, we report a streamlined approach combining orthogonal crosslinking afforded by a genetically encoded &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;lysine (BeLaK) and genetic supercharging to generate cell&#8208;penetrating monobodies. When introduced to the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;strand of a series of supercharged monobodies, BeLaK enabled efficient inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with the neighbouring lysine. Compared to its non&#8208;crosslinked counterpart, a BeLaK&#8208;crosslinked, +18&#8208;charged monobody exhibited enhanced thermostability and greater cellular uptake at 40&#8197;nM. Moreover, this structurally rigidified, supercharged monobody inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in KYSE&#8208;520 esophageal cancer cell line at sub&#8208;micromolar concentration, indicating significant endosomal escape after endocytosis. Together, the discovery of this BeLaK&#8208;encoded, rigidified immunoglobin fold should facilitate the design of cell&#8208;penetrating monobodies targeting intracellular signalling proteins.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway in Dual Dynamic Covalent Polymeric Systems</title>

&#8220;One monomer for two materials&#8221;: Dual dynamic covalent chemistries diversify the pathway of molecular self&#8208;assembly and produce distinct polymeric materials as a function of evaporation rate.







Abstract
Kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly is garnering increasing interest in the field of supramolecular polymers and materials, yet examples involving dynamic covalent exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here we report an unexpected dynamic covalent polymeric system whose aqueous self&#8208;assembly pathway is strongly influenced by the kinetics of evaporation of water. The key design is to integrate dual dynamic covalent bonds&#8212;including disulfide bonds and boroxine/borate&#8212;into a dynamic equilibrium system of monomers, polymers, and materials. This dual dynamic covalent design allows polymer growth and crosslinking to occur with the same spatiotemporal characteristics, governed solely by solvent evaporation. We found that a single building block can assemble into two distinct types of polymeric materials, each characterized by unique crosslinking topologies, orders, solubility, and macroscopic properties. The dual dynamic nature of the materials imparts them with intrinsic reconfigurability, such as interfacial repairability and close&#8208;loop chemical recyclability.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinetically controlled self-assembly is garnering increasing interest in the field of supramolecular polymers and materials, yet examples involving dynamic covalent exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here we report an unexpected dynamic covalent polymeric system whose aqueous self-assembly pathway is strongly influenced by the kinetics of evaporation of water. The key design is to integrate dual dynamic covalent bonds&#8212;including disulfide bonds and boroxine/borate&#8212;into a dynamic equilibrium system of monomers, polymers, and materials. This dual dynamic covalent design allows polymer growth and crosslinking to occur with the same spatiotemporal characteristics, governed solely by solvent evaporation. We found that a single building block can assemble into two distinct types of polymeric materials, each characterized by unique crosslinking topologies, orders, solubility, and macroscopic properties. The dual dynamic nature of the materials imparts them with intrinsic reconfigurability, such as interfacial repairability and close-loop chemical recyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Unprecedent Layered Perovskite&#8208;Type Heterostructure Ferroelectric via Chemical Molecular Scissor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode. This work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.







Abstract
Precise stacking of distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rigid slabs to build heterostructures has renewed the portfolio of 2D materials, e.g., magic&#8208;angle graphene, due to the emergence of exotic physical properties. Recently, single&#8208;crystal heterostructures of layered perovskites have emerged as an exciting branch, while it remains scarce to achieve strong ferroelectricity in this new heterostructure family. Here, we present the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal, (EA3Pb2Br7)EA4Pb3Br10 (1, EA=ethylamine), by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. It has notable ferroelectricity of large spontaneous polarization (Ps~5.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and high Curie temperature (Tc~375&#8197;K). Structurally, its inorganic framework adopts a unique 2D heterostructure that contains two different rigid slabs of {EA3Pb2Br7}n and {EA4Pb3Br10}n. This motif is self&#8208;assembled by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer clipping of rigid prototype sheets, using extra neopentylamine as a molecular chemical scissor. Unlike epitaxial growth, such a molecule&#8208;level stacking facilitates the growth of heterostructure single crystals. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device of 1 exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode, being the highest level of 2D perovskite ferroelectric family. Our work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Anion Transport by Bambusuril&#8208;Bile Acid Conjugates: Drastic Effect of the Cholesterol Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bambusuril macrocycles were functionalized with bile acids of different polarities and studied as anion transporters. The bambusuril with the most polar bile acids was demonstrated to form a unimolecular anion channel. Furthermore, increasing the cholesterol content in the membrane of liposomes drastically decreased the ion transport activity, likely squeezing the bile acid arms together to close the channel.







Abstract
Artificial anion transporters offer a potential way to treat deficiencies in cellular anion transport of genetic origins. In contrast to the large variety of mobile anion carriers and self&#8208;assembled anion channels reported, unimolecular anion channels are less investigated. Herein, we present a unique example of a unimolecular anion channel based on a bambusuril (BU) macrocycle, a well&#8208;established anion receptor. The BU structure was expanded by appending various bile acid residues allowing a single molecule to span the membrane. Chloride transport mediated by BUs through lipid bilayers was investigated in liposomes and these studies revealed a surprisingly high dependence of the anion transport activity on the cholesterol content in the liposomal membrane.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Modulation of Li+ Solvation Structures towards Optimal Electrolyte Systems for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte has been successfully developed by aid of machine learning, which can show anion&#8208;induced ion&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordinated structures. As a result, a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI could be formed on anode, while large sized Li2O2 particles on cathode by regulating the growth pathway, enabling exceptional Li&#8722;O2 battery performance. These findings highlight the critical role of solvation structures and provide valuable theoretical guidance for rational design of next&#8208;generation electrolyte systems.







Abstract
As the &#8220;blood&#8221; of Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs), electrolytes with various solvation structures of Li+ can greatly influence the composition of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and the growth kinetics of Li2O2 on cathode, and further the battery performance. However, achieving delicate modulation of the multi&#8208;composition electrolytes remains significantly challenging to simultaneously give consideration to both the anode and cathode reactions. In this work, we employed Bayesian optimization to develop advanced electrolytes for LOBs, enabling the formation of a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, and modulation of Li2O2 morphologies. Thus obtained LOBs using the optimized dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte could deliver a discharge capacity of 14,063&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is far higher than those using the single&#8208;solvent electrolytes. This study not only highlights the critical role of the solvation structure for improving the battery performance, but also provides new insights and important theoretical guidance for delicate modulation of electrolyte compositions.

         <title>Electrochemical Cyclopropanation of Unactivated Alkenes with Methylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the organo&#8208;mediated electrooxidative cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with methylene compounds has been developed. The method shows excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope that can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of biorelevant compounds.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive compounds, functioning as a significant structural motif. Although a series of methods have been developed for the construction of the cyclopropane skeleton, the development of a direct and efficient strategy for the rapid synthesis of cyclopropanes from bench&#8208;stable starting materials with a broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance remains challenging and highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the direct cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes using active methylene compounds. The strategy shows a broad substrate scope with a high level of functional group compatibility, as well as potential application as demonstrated by late&#8208;stage cyclopropanation of complex molecules and drug derivatives. Further mechanistic investigations suggest that Cp2Fe (Fc) plays an essential role as an oxidative mediator in generating radicals from active methylene compounds.
