         <title>C&#8208;Boron Enolates Enable Palladium Catalyzed Carboboration of&#160;Internal 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, generated by a kinetically controlled halogen exchange between chlorocatecholborane and silylketene acetals, is described. These C&#8208;boron enolates are demonstrated to activate 1,3&#8208;enyne substrates in the presence of a Pd(0)/Senphos ligand complex, resulting in the first examples of a carboboration reaction of an alkyne with enolate&#8208;equivalent nucleophiles. Highly substituted dienyl boron building blocks are produced in excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity by the described catalytic&#160;  cis  &#8208;carboboration reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Indolizy Carbene Ligand. Evaluation of Electronic Properties and Applications in Asymmetric Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a new family of carbene ligands based on an indolizine&#8208;ylidene (Indolizy) moiety. The corresponding gold(I) complexes are easily obtained from the gold(I)&#8208;promoted cyclization of allenylpyridine precursors. Evaluation of the electronic properties by experimental methods and also by DFT calculations confirm strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands. Cationization of the gold(I) complexes generates catalytic species that trigger diverse reactions of (poly)unsaturated precursors. When armed with a methylene phosphine oxide moiety on the stereogenic center adjacent to the nitrogen atom, the corresponding bifunctional carbene ligands give rise to highly enantioselective heterocyclizations. DFT calculations brought some rationalization and highlighted the critical roles played by the phosphine oxide group and the tosylate anion in the asymmetric cyclization of &#947;&#8208;allenols.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;triggered Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells transmit piconewton forces to receptors to mediate processes such as migration and immune recognition. A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano&#8208;HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano&#8208;HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano&#8208;IC  50  for aspirin, Y&#8208;27632, and eptifibatide. Given that cell mechanical phenotypes are of clinical importance, mechano&#8208;HCR may offer a convenient route for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to and Reactivity of Fe0, Fe&#8722;I, FeI, and FeII PCcarbeneP Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex. Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states.







Abstract
Despite their promising metal&#8211;ligand cooperative reactivity, PCcarbeneP pincer ligands are rarely reported for first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal centres. Using a dehydration methodology, we report access to an Fe0 PCcarbeneP pincer complex (1) that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex (3). Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position in 1 is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8722;H bond addition (E=H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8211;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. The PCcarbeneP pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal FeII, FeI, and Fe&#8722;I oxidation states, as demonstrated with synthesis and characterization of the complexes [11&#8208;X][BArF20] (X=Br, I), 12, and K[13]. Compound K[13] is found to be highly reactive, and abstracts hydrogen from a range of aliphatic C&#8722;H sources. Computational analysis by DFT suggests that the formal FeI and Fe&#8722;I complexes contain significant carbene radical character. The ability of the PCcarbeneP ligand scaffold to partake in metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and to support a range of iron oxidation states renders it as potentially useful in many catalytic applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Modification of Active Matrix Metalloproteases: Activity&#8208;based Probes with no Photolabile Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based probes have been designed that react with matrix metalloproteases active sites without any external trigger. These phosphinic pseudo peptide probes displayed a preference for human matrix metalloelastase hMMP&#8208;12 and were capable of selectively labelling human and mouse MMP&#8208;12 in complex proteomes.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes enable discrimination between the active enzyme and its inactive or inactivated counterparts. Since metalloproteases catalysis is non&#8208;covalent, activity&#8208;based probes targeting them have been systematically developed by decorating reversible inhibitors with photo&#8208;crosslinkers. By exploiting two types of ligand&#8208;guided chemistry, we identified novel activity&#8208;based probes capable of covalently modifying the active site of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) without any external trigger. The ability of these probes to label recombinant MMPs was validated in&#8197;vitro and the identity of the main labelling sites within their S3&#8242; region unambiguously assigned. We also demonstrated that our affinity probes can react with rhMMP12 at nanogram scale (that is, at 0.07&#8201;% (w/w)) in complex proteomes. Finally, this ligand&#8208;directed chemistry was successfully applied to label active MMP&#8208;12 secreted by eukaryote cells. We believe that this approach could be transferred more widely to many other metalloproteases, thus contributing to tackle their unresolved proteomic profiling in&#8197;vivo.

&#8220;Ligandless&#8221; nickel was found to be exceptionally capable of acting as a reservoir of fluoroalkyl anions or radicals. This property was exploited to fluoroalkylate organic substrates under stoichiometric and catalytic conditions.







Abstract
The acetonitrile&#8208;solvated [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; was prepared in order to compare and contrast its reactivity with the known [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; towards organic electrophiles. Both [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; and [(MeCN)Ni(C2F5)3]&#8722; successfully react with aryl iodonium and diazonium salts as well as alkynyl iodonium salts to give fluoroalkylated organic products. Electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)NiII(C2F5)3]&#8722; suggests that, upon electro&#8208;oxidation to [(MeCN)nNiIII(C2F5)3], reductive homolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)2NiII(C2F5)2]. Catalytic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylations of electron&#8208;rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3]&#8722; or the related [Ni(CF3)4]2&#8722;. Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that &#8220;ligandless&#8221; nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF3 groups under catalytically relevant conditions.

         <title>A Family of Superhelicenes: Easily Tunable, Chiral Nanographenes by Merging Helicity with Planar &#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterization of a family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes that consist of HBCs fused via different five&#8208;membered rings. Despite being only a small part of the compounds, the nature of the five&#8208;membered rings has a huge impact on the properties of the whole molecule. We show the enantiomeric separation and circular dichroism properties together with X&#8208;ray analysis and charge transport calculations.







Abstract
We designed a straightforward synthetic route towards a full&#8208;fledged family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes: superhelicenes. They have two hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) in common that are connected via a central five&#8208;membered ring. By means of structurally altering this 5&#8208;membered ring, we realized a versatile library of molecular building blocks. Not only the superhelicene structure, but also their features are tuned with ease. In&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterizations served as a proof of concept thereof. The superhelicene enantiomers were separated, their circular dichroism was measured in preliminary studies and concluded with an enantiomeric assignment. Our work was rounded&#8208;off by crystal structure analyses. Mixed stacks of M&#8208; and P&#8208;isomers led to twisted molecular wires. Using such stacks, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities were calculated, giving reason to expect outstanding hole transporting properties.

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from Octahedral TiIV Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octahedral TiIV complex was used to construct the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with the edge transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 shows high crystallinity, superior stability, abundant porosity, and high photocatalytic activity for Meerwein addition reactions. This research will extend to enrich the structure and functionality of 3D frameworks.







Abstract
The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral TiIV complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected soc topology. Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1 has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86&#8197;eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.

         <title>Supramolecular Cylinders Target Bulge Structures in the 5&#8242; UTR of the RNA Genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Inhibit Viral Replication**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Viral untranslated regulatory regions (UTRs) contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic RNA structures crucial for viral replication. Combining in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8217; UTR of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 are created. Metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates are shown to bind at a bulge and junction, and in cell assays confirm that they inhibit viral infection.







Abstract
The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine in vitro RNA analysis with molecular dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5&#8242; UTR of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Crystalline COF Membranes from Amorphous Polymeric Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transformation strategy is developed for the scalable fabrication of highly crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membrane from amorphous polymeric membrane via monomer exchange.







Abstract

         <title>A Light&#8208;Controllable Chemical Modulation of m6A RNA Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route for the spatiotemporal control of intracellular RNA epigenetic modifications is presented. The agonism effect of a small compound can be concealed through appropriate photo&#8208;responsive caging groups, and the synthesized compounds exhibited a high sensitivity of external light irradiation and rapidly restored their effects in live cells.







Abstract
Bioactive small molecules with photo&#8208;removable protecting groups have provided spatial and temporal control of corresponding biological effects. We present the design, synthesis, computational and experimental evaluation of the first photo&#8208;activatable small&#8208;molecule methyltransferase agonist. By blocking the functional N&#8208;H group on MPCH with a photo&#8208;removable ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety, we have developed a promising photo&#8208;caged compound that had completely concealed its biological activity. Short UV light exposure of cells treated with that caged molecule in a few minutes resulted in a considerable hypermethylation of m6A modification in transcriptome RNAs, implicating a rapid release of the parent active compound. This study validates for the first time the photo&#8208;activatable small organic molecular concept in the field of RNA epigenetic research, which represents a novel tool in spatiotemporal and cellular modulation approaches.

         <title>Ultrasmall Nanocapsules Obtained by Controlling Ostwald Ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ostwald ripening is used for reducing particle size in miniemulsions, providing a rapid and versatile method to synthesize silica nanocapsules with an ultrasmall size (ca. 6&#8197;nm) and a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology, even at low surfactant concentration. Aqueous solubility of solvents and reactivity of alkoxysilanes used in the synthesis are the key factors in controlling the formation of ultrasmall nanocapsules.







Abstract
We describe here a method to synthesize ultrasmall nanocapsules with a diameter of 6&#8197;nm, exhibiting a well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell morphology. Remarkably, the nanocapules are synthesized in a miniemulsion process without the need of large amounts of surfactant as commonly used in the microemulsion process. Ultrasmall nanocapsules with an oil core and a silica shell are formed by the concurrent processes of a sol&#8211;gel reaction and Ostwald ripening. Using solvents with different water solubilities and alkoxysilanes with different reactivities, we demonstrate that sizes of obtained nanocapsules depend on the ripening rate and alkoxysilane conversion rate. The method can be also used for encapsulating natural oils such as peppermint oil and limonene. This work shows that the Ostwald ripening phenomenon can be employed beneficially for the preparation of very small colloids.

         <title>Influence of Magnetic Fields on Electrochemical Reactions of Redox Cofactor Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches the underlying mechanism of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven enhancement of Faradaic currents in solutions of redox cofactors, such as flavin mononucleotide, was investigated. The findings reveal that a magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect rather than radical pair mechanism is responsible for the observed current enhancement.







Abstract
Redox cofactors mediate many enzymatic processes and are increasingly employed in biomedical and energy applications. Exploring the influence of external magnetic fields on redox cofactor chemistry can enhance our understanding of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;sensitive biological processes and allow the application of magnetic fields to modulate redox reactions involving cofactors. Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on electrochemical reactions in redox cofactor solutions. By employing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor as a model system, we characterize magnetically induced changes in Faradaic currents. We find that radical pair intermediates have negligible influence on current increases in FMN solution upon application of a magnetic field. The dominant mechanism underlying the observed current increases is the magneto&#8208;hydrodynamic effect. We extend our analyses to other diffusion&#8208;limited electrochemical reactions of redox cofactor solutions and arrive at similar conclusions, highlighting the opportunity to use this framework in redox cofactor chemistry.

         <title>Unusual Surface Texture, Dimensions and Morphology Variations of Chiral and Single Crystals**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The egg&#8208;shaped homochiral crystals: A brain&#8208;like texture combined with single crystallinity. A series of isomorphous crystals found in a rare space group have been formed with varied morphologies. These crystals contain chiral channels and are made from achiral components.







Abstract
We demonstrate here a unique metallo&#8208;organic material where the appearance and the internal crystal structure are in contradiction. The egg&#8208;shaped (ovoid) crystals have a brain&#8208;like texture. Although these micro&#8208;sized crystals are monodispersed; like fingerprints their grainy surfaces are never exactly alike. Remarkably, our X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction studies unexpectedly revealed that these structures are single&#8208;crystals comprising a continuous coordination network of two differently shaped homochiral channels. By using the same building blocks under different reaction conditions, a rare series of crystals have been obtained that are uniquely rounded in their shape. In stark contrast to the brain&#8208;like crystals, these isostructural and monodispersed crystals have a comparatively smooth appearance. The sizes of these crystals vary by several orders of magnitude.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H Heteroarylation via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of decatungstate photocatalysis with oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover is reported. This strategy enables the C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation under mild conditions with excellent functional group tolerance. It was also adopted to enable late&#8208;stage functionalization of valuable compounds. Microflow technology reduced reaction times and boosted productivity of the transformation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is a very powerful strategy for the regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we report on the unprecedented combination of decatungstate hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis with the oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover concept to access the direct net&#8208;oxidative C(sp3)&#8211;H heteroarylation. The present methodology demonstrates a high functional group tolerance (40 examples) and is scalable when using continuous&#8208;flow reactor technology. The developed protocol is also amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant molecules such as stanozolol, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, podophyllotoxin, and dideoxyribose.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of decatungstate photocatalysis with oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover is reported. This strategy enables the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H heteroarylation under mild conditions with excellent functional group tolerance. It was also adopted to enable late-stage functionalization of valuable compounds. Microflow technology reduced reaction times and boosted productivity of the transformation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is a very powerful strategy for the regioselective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H functionalization of organic molecules. Herein, we report on the unprecedented combination of decatungstate hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis with the oxidative radical&#8211;polar crossover concept to access the direct net-oxidative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H heteroarylation. The present methodology demonstrates a high functional group tolerance (40 examples) and is scalable when using continuous-flow reactor technology. The developed protocol is also amenable to the late-stage functionalization of biologically relevant molecules such as stanozolol, (&#8722;)-ambroxide, podophyllotoxin, and dideoxyribose.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Influence of a Changing Local Environment during Photoinduced CO2 Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following individual molecules and their changing environment during photoinduced dissociation reveals the importance of local changes during a reaction on its efficiency. Two counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;shaped reactivity.







Abstract
Though largely influencing the efficiency of a reaction, the molecular&#8208;scale details of the local environment of the reactants are experimentally inaccessible hindering an in&#8208;depth understanding of a catalyst's reactivity, a prerequisite to maximizing its efficiency. We introduce a method to follow individual molecules and their largely changing environment during a photochemical reaction. The method is illustrated for a rate&#8208;limiting step in a photolytic reaction, the dissociation of CO2 on two catalytically relevant surfaces, Ag(100) and Cu(111). We reveal with a single&#8208;molecule resolution how the reactant's surroundings evolve with progressing laser illumination and with it their propensity for dissociation. Counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;like reactivity. Our unprecedented local view during a photoinduced reaction opens the avenue for understanding the influence of the products on reaction yields on the nanoscale.

         <title>Influence of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticle Sizes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particle&#8208;size reduction of iron sulfide nanoparticles improves its performance as an active material in solid&#8208;state conversion cathodes: For reduced particle dimensions, the electrochemical utilization of FeS2 is increased. The potential of FeS2 as an electrode in solid&#8208;state batteries is highlighted and the importance of the morphological design of battery materials is underscored.







Abstract
Given the inherent performance limitations of intercalation&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state conversion batteries are promising systems for future energy storage. A high specific capacity and natural abundancy make iron disulfide (FeS2) a promising cathode&#8208;active material. In this work, FeS2 nanoparticles were prepared solvothermally. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, samples with average particle diameters between 10&#8197;nm and 35&#8197;nm were synthesized. The electrochemical performance was evaluated in solid&#8208;state cells with a Li&#8208;argyrodite solid electrolyte. While the reduction of FeS2 was found to be irreversible in the initial discharge, a stable cycling of the reduced species was observed subsequently. A positive effect of smaller particle dimensions on FeS2 utilization was identified, which can be attributed to a higher interfacial contact area and shortened diffusion pathways inside the FeS2 particles. These results highlight the general importance of morphological design to exploit the promising theoretical capacity of conversion electrodes in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Combining High&#8208;Throughput Synthesis and High&#8208;Throughput Protein Crystallography for Accelerated Hit Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Parallel, automated, and practical multicomponent reaction synthesis of high diversity acrylamides/ester libraries and HT protein crystallography (PX) yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. More general, integration of HT PX and HT synthesis into the &#8220;design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze&#8221; cycle will open unprecedented horizons in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Protein crystallography (PX) is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to discover medicinal chemistry starting points by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in PX could allow for a more integrated role into early drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput PX. We describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to acrylamides and &#8208;esters from diverse building blocks suitable for mmol scale synthesis on 96&#8208;well format and on a high&#8208;throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. High&#8208;throughput PX of our libraries efficiently yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of in situ HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT PX has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.

         <title>Coupling Aptamer&#8208;based Protein Tagging with Metabolic Glycan Labeling for In Situ Visualization and Biological Function Study of Exosomal Protein&#8208;Specific Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual labeling strategy for in situ visualization of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling (ExoAp&#8208;MGL) was used to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation is required for the interaction of exoPD&#8208;L1/PD&#8208;1 and inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation.







Abstract
Exosomal glycoproteins play important roles in many physiological and pathological functions. Herein, we developed a dual labeling strategy based on a protein&#8208;specific aptamer tagging and metabolic glycan labeling for visualizing glycosylation of specific proteins on exosomes. The glycosylation of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (exoPD&#8208;L1) was imaged in situ using intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent PD&#8208;L1 aptamers bound on exoPD&#8208;L1 and fluorescent tags on glycans introduced via metabolic glycan labeling. This method enables in situ visualization and biological function study of exosomal protein glycosylation. Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 glycosylation was confirmed to be required in interaction with PD&#8208;1 and participated in inhibiting of CD8+ T cell proliferation. This is an efficient and non&#8208;destructive method to study the presence and function of exosomal protein&#8208;specific glycosylation in situ, which provides a powerful tool for exosomal glycoproteomics research.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Binding&#8208;Initiated Activation of O&#8722;H Bonds on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Surface for the Catalytic Oxidation of Biomass Hydroxyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#916;G0 value of on&#8208;surface hydrogen binding was obtained from the chemical&#8208;shift change of the involved protons and the variation of acceptor concentrations via NMR. This reflects the ability of the catalyst surface to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups. The on&#8208;surface hydrogen&#8208;binding was successfully employed to drive the initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in probing the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural with Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen binding of molecules on solid surfaces is an attractive interaction that can be used as the driving force for bond activation, material&#8208;directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of a quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surfaces seriously limits its application. We measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G0) of on&#8208;surface HBs using NMR. The HB&#8208;accepting ability of the surface was investigated by comparing &#916;G0 values employing the model biomass platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;n catalysts with adjustable electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;doped contents. Decreasing &#916;G0 improves the HB&#8208;accepting ability of the nitrogen&#8208;doped surface and promotes the selectively initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated. In addition to the excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) for this oxidation is much higher than for reported non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts.

The on-surface hydrogen-binding was successfully employed to drive the initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in probing the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural with Co-N-C catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen binding of molecules on solid surfaces is an attractive interaction that can be used as the driving force for bond activation, material-directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of a quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surfaces seriously limits its application. We measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) of on-surface HBs using NMR. The HB-accepting ability of the surface was investigated by comparing &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; values employing the model biomass platform 5-hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co-N-C-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; catalysts with adjustable electron-rich nitrogen-doped contents. Decreasing &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; improves the HB-accepting ability of the nitrogen-doped surface and promotes the selectively initiated activation of O&#8722;H bonds in the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated. In addition to the excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) for this oxidation is much higher than for reported non-noble-metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulfate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of AgF with SOF4 in MeCN solution gives rise to solvated AgOSF5, which defines the starting point for a variety of other SF5O compounds. For example, transition metal salts are accessible by metathesis; furthermore, bipyridine&#8208;stabilised AgOSF5 has proven its general utility in the preparation of SF5O&#8208;substituted aromatics. The solid&#8208;state structure of the distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anion has been revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Herein, we report the preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulfate from commercially available AgF and OSF4. The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5 has been stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5 complexes with NiII, CuI, and CuII&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5 has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5 groups to aryne moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5&#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition&#8208;metal OSF5 compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8722; anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.

         <title>25 Years of Reticular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular chemistry translates the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. The most profound innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. This Review highlights the classes of reticular materials, their functionalization, and the introduction of complexity into their backbones.







Abstract
At its core, reticular chemistry has translated the precision and expertise of organic and inorganic synthesis to the solid state. While initial excitement over metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was undoubtedly fueled by their unprecedented porosity and surface areas, the most profound scientific innovation of the field has been the elaboration of design strategies for the synthesis of extended crystalline solids through strong directional bonds. In this contribution we highlight the different classes of reticular materials that have been developed, how these frameworks can be functionalized, and how complexity can be introduced into their backbones. Finally, we show how the structural control over these materials is being extended from the molecular scale to their crystal morphology and shape on the nanoscale, all the way to their shaping on the bulk scale.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted wide attention for their easy preparation, low toxicity, and applications in various fields like bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Developing phosphorescent systems with more universality and less difficulty in synthesis has long been the pursuit of materials scientists. By employing polymeric quaternary ammonium salt with an ionic bonding matrix and heavy atoms, commercial fluorescent dyes are directly endowed with phosphorescence emission. In a single amorphous polymer, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates excited triplet states and the rigid polymer matrix stabilizes them. This study put forward a new general strategy to design and develop pure organic RTP materials starting from existing library of organic dyes without complicated chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Droplet Formation and Facile Cytosolic Translocation of IgG in the Presence of Attenuated Cationic Amphiphilic Lytic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for intracellular delivery of IgG. Liquid droplets were formed by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with cell membrane led to quick influx of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells. Successful delivery of functional proteins into cells allowed binding to subcellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.







Abstract
Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated cationic amphiphilic lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) delivery into cells. Particle&#8208;like liquid droplets were generated by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with the cellular membrane led to spontaneous influx and distribution of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells in serum containing medium. Involvement of cellular machinery accompanied by actin polymerization and membrane ruffling was suggested for the translocation. Alexa488&#8208;IgG negative charges were crucial in liquid droplet formation with positively charged FcB(L17E)3. Binding of IgG to FcB(L17E)3 may not be necessary. Successful intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 594&#8208;labeled anti&#8208;nuclear pore complex antibody and anti&#8208;mCherry&#8208;nanobody tagged with supernegatively charged green fluorescence protein allowed binding to cellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.

         <title>Capture and Separation of SO2 Traces in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Pre&#8208;Synthetic Pore Environment Tailoring by Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment tailoring strategy has been applied to improve low&#8208;pressure SO2 affinity on stable isostructural methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs by controlling methyl groups density. Enhanced low&#8208;pressure SO2 uptake and SO2 separation was achieved. This work provides a facile strategy to obtain tailor&#8208;made MOF adsorbents for challenging gas purification applications.







Abstract
Herein, we report a pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO2 binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO2 adsorption and SO2/CO2 separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni2(BDC&#8208;X)2DABCO] (BDC&#8208;X=mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO2 affinity over the parent MOF. The SO2 separation potential by methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated and experimental breakthrough curves, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Selective Permeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Channels on Lithium Metal for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface were created by aminopropyl&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxane anchored, which allow lithium ions to get through, while the polysulfides to be effectively blocked due to the much larger volume than lithium ions. The selective lithium ion channels enable a prolonged cycle life and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are considered a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage. However, the strong reducibility and high reactivity of lithium lead to low Coulombic efficiency when contacting oxidants, such as lithium polysulfide caused by the serious &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein we design selectively permeable lithium&#8208;ion channels on lithium metal surface, which allow lithium ions to pass through by electrochemical overpotential, while the polysulfides are effectively blocked due to the much larger steric hindrance than lithium ions. The selective permeation of lithium ions through the channels is further elucidated by the molecular simulation and visualization experiment. Consequently, a prolonged cycle life of 75&#8197;cycles and high Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% are achieved in a practical Li&#8211;S pouch cell with limited amounts of lithium and electrolyte, confirming the unique role the selective ion permeation plays in protecting highly reactive alkali metal anodes in working batteries.

         <title>Monitoring Solid&#8208;Phase Reactions in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reproducible, homogeneous plasmonic substrate was fabricated by electron&#8208;beam lithography to detect the Raman fingerprints of molecular self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) at all points of the substrate with high uniformity. This substrate was employed for characterizing the intermediates and the product of a solid&#8208;phase synthesis in a SAM by SERS.







Abstract
Nanopatterned surfaces enhance incident electromagnetic radiation and thereby enable the detection and characterization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), for instance in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Herein, Au nanohole arrays, developed and characterized as SERS substrates, are exemplarily used for monitoring a solid&#8208;phase deprotection and a subsequent copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; reaction, performed directly on the corresponding SAMs. The SERS substrate was found to be highly reliable in terms of signal reproducibility and chemical stability. Furthermore, the intermediates and the product of the solid&#8208;phase synthesis were identified by SERS. The spectra of the immobilized compounds showed minor differences compared to spectra of the microcrystalline solids. With its uniform SERS signals and the high chemical stability, the platform paves the way for monitoring molecular manipulations in surface functionalization applications.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Vertex Linkage of (BO4)&#8208;Tetrahedra in a Borosulfate: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)] was obtained under harsh conditions in a specially designed setup. In contrast to silicates and its substitution variants like alumosilicates, the anionic substructure of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)] reveals vertex linkage of three (BO4) tetrahedra via a common oxygen atom. DFT calculations help to elucidate the nature of this special bonding situation.







Abstract
Borosulfates are classified as silicate analogue materials. The number of crystallographically characterized compounds is still limited, whereas the structural diversity is already impressive. The anionic substructures of borosulfates exhibit vertex&#8208;connected (BO4)&#8208; and (SO4)&#8208;tetrahedra, whereas bridging between two (SO4)&#8208; or even between two (BO4)&#8208;tetrahedra is scarce. The herein presented compound Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)] is the first borosulfate with a triple&#8208;vertex linkage of three (BO4) tetrahedra via one common oxygen atom. DFT calculations complement the experimental studies. Bader charges (calculated for all atoms) as well as charge&#8208;density calculations give hint to the electron distribution within the anionic substructure and density&#8208;of&#8208;states calculations support the interpretation of the bonding situation.

         <title>An Element&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutadiene Exhibiting High&#8208;Energy Blue Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity and photophysical properties of a planar cyclic 4&#960; system, based on studies on a diazadiboretidine derivative, an isoelectronic heterocyclic analogue of cyclobutadiene. Diazadiboretidine, despite having the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels, displays blue phosphorescence, rather than thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
1,3,2,4&#8208;Diazadiboretidine, an isoelectronic heteroanalogue of cyclobutadiene, is an interesting chemical species in terms of comparison with the carbon system, whereas its properties have never been investigated experimentally. According to Baird's rule, H&#252;ckel antiaromatic cyclobutadiene acquires aromaticity in the lowest triplet state. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies on the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity/aromaticity as well as the photophysical properties of an isolable 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidine derivative. The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B2N2 ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B2N2 ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence.

&lt;p&gt;We report the ground- and excited-state aromaticity and photophysical properties of a planar cyclic 4&#960; system, based on studies on a diazadiboretidine derivative, an isoelectronic heterocyclic analogue of cyclobutadiene. Diazadiboretidine, despite having the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels, displays blue phosphorescence, rather than thermally activated delayed fluorescence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,3,2,4-Diazadiboretidine, an isoelectronic heteroanalogue of cyclobutadiene, is an interesting chemical species in terms of comparison with the carbon system, whereas its properties have never been investigated experimentally. According to Baird's rule, H&#252;ckel antiaromatic cyclobutadiene acquires aromaticity in the lowest triplet state. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies on the ground- and excited-state antiaromaticity/aromaticity as well as the photophysical properties of an isolable 1,3,2,4-diazadiboretidine derivative. The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Introducing Intermolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions for Water&#8208;Stable Low Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskites are unstable in water due to the high water solubility of the A&#8208;site cations present in them. We introduce the intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between the A&#8208;site organic cations in 1D hybrid lead bromide perovskites. The cation&#8208;&#960; interactions make these 1D perovskites completely stable in water.







Abstract
Optoelectronically active hybrid lead halide perovskites dissociate in water. To prevent this dissociation, here, we introduce long&#8208;range intermolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between A&#8208;site cations of hybrid perovskites. An aromatic diamine like 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine, if protonated, can show a long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; stacking, and therefore, serves as our A&#8208;site cation. Consequently, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridinium lead bromide [(4,4&#8242;&#8208;TMDP)Pb2Br6], a one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, remains completely stable after continuous water treatment for six months. Mechanistic insights about the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions are obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The concept of long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is further extended to another A&#8208;site cation 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridinium ion (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP), forming water&#8208;stable (4,4&#8242;&#8208;EDP)Pb2Br6 perovskite. These water&#8208;stable perovskites are then used to fabricate white light&#8208;emitting diode and for light up&#8208;conversion through tunable third&#8208;harmonic generation. Note that the achieved water stability is the intrinsic stability of perovskite composition, unlike the prior approach of encapsulating the unstable perovskite material (or device) by water&#8208;resistant materials. The introduced cation&#8208;&#960; interactions can be a breakthrough strategy in designing many more compositions of water&#8208;stable low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites.

         <title>A Direct Organocatalytic Enantioselective Route to Functionalized trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Products Having the Norcarane Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric organocatalytic methodology for obtaining diverse trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder products with up to 86&#8201;% yield &gt;20:1 d.r. &gt;99&#8201;% ee and five stereocenters, of which one is a quaternary carbon, has been developed. This was achieved using a pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to increase reactivity and selectivity. An SN2&#8208;like substitution at a tertiary center transforms the fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder intermediate into the trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product.







Abstract
An enantioselective methodology to construct trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder scaffolds by organocatalysis with excellent selectivity, high yield and up to five contiguous stereocenters is presented. The reaction concept integrates the halogen effect and a novel discovered pseudo&#8208;halogen effect to direct an endo&#8208;selective, secondary&#8208;amine catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction allowing for the subsequent formation of trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadducts featuring the norcarene scaffold. The methodology relies on the reaction between an in situ generated trienamine and an &#945;&#8208;brominated or &#945;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;halogenated enone to form a fleeting cis&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder intermediate. The endo&#8208;transition state&#8208;enhanced by the (pseudo&#8208;)halogen effect&#8208;sets the stereochemistry that allows for a subsequent SN2&#8208;like reaction at a tertiary center to obtain the trans&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder scaffold. The mechanism was investigated and supported by experimental results as well as computational studies.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in biorthogonal click chemistry have broadened the scope of bioimaging and bioanalytical studies applied to a large array of molecular targets in vivo as well as ex vivo. Here, we discuss the hurdles encountered when targeting intracellular compartments by metabolic labeling and other approaches, and present the solutions currently being developed to improve the efficiency of click ligations in living cells.







Abstract
The surging development of bioorthogonal chemistry has profoundly transformed chemical biology over the last two decades. Involving chemical partners that specifically react together in highly complex biological fluids, this branch of chemistry now allows researchers to probe biomolecules in their natural habitat through metabolic labelling technologies. Chemical reporter strategies include metabolic glycan labelling, site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids in proteins, and post&#8208;synthetic labelling of nucleic acids. While a majority of literature reports mark cell&#8208;surface exposed targets, implementing bioorthogonal ligations in the interior of cells constitutes a more challenging task. Owing to limiting factors such as membrane permeability of reagents, fluorescence background due to hydrophobic interactions and off&#8208;target covalent binding, and suboptimal balance between reactivity and stability of the designed molecular reporters and probes, these strategies need mindful planning to achieve success. In this review, we discuss the hurdles encountered when targeting biomolecules localized in cell organelles and give an easily accessible summary of the strategies at hand for imaging intracellular targets.

         <title>AgII&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Ambient CH4 Functionalization Inspired by HSAB Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the HSAB theory, we explored the electrocatalytic CH4 functionalization mediated by AgII metalloradical, the last class (b) transition metal whose reactivity towards CH4 is unknown. Detailed mechanistic investigation unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH4 activation up to 2.8&#215;103&#8197;h&#8722;1 at room temperature.







Abstract
Although most class (b) transition metals have been studied in regard to CH4 activation, divalent silver (AgII), possibly owing to its reactive nature, is the only class (b) high&#8208;valent transition metal center that is not yet reported to exhibit reactivities towards CH4 activation. We now report that electrochemically generated AgII metalloradical readily functionalizes CH4 into methyl bisulfate (CH3OSO3H) at ambient conditions in 98&#8201;% H2SO4. Mechanistic investigation experimentally unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, a high pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of CH4 activation up to 2.8&#215;103&#8197;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and a CH4 pressure of 85&#8197;psi, and two competing reaction pathways preferable towards CH4 activation over solvent oxidation. Reaction kinetic data suggest a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% beyond 180&#8197;psi CH4 at room temperature for potential chemical production from widely distributed natural gas resources with minimal infrastructure reliance.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the HSAB theory, we explored the electrocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; functionalization mediated by Ag&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; metalloradical, the last class (b) transition metal whose reactivity towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is unknown. Detailed mechanistic investigation unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high pseudo-first-order rate constant of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation up to 2.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most class (b) transition metals have been studied in regard to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation, divalent silver (Ag&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;), possibly owing to its reactive nature, is the only class (b) high-valent transition metal center that is not yet reported to exhibit reactivities towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation. We now report that electrochemically generated Ag&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; metalloradical readily functionalizes CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into methyl bisulfate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H) at ambient conditions in 98&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistic investigation experimentally unveils a low activation energy of 13.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high pseudo-first-order rate constant of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation up to 2.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature and a CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pressure of 85&#8197;psi, and two competing reaction pathways preferable towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation over solvent oxidation. Reaction kinetic data suggest a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% beyond 180&#8197;psi CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature for potential chemical production from widely distributed natural gas resources with minimal infrastructure reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Conversion to Methanol in a Bifunctional Zeolite Catalytic Membrane Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalytic membrane reactor is developed for CO2 conversion to methanol, in which CO2 conversion to methanol and the by&#8208;product water removal by hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane is realized simultaneously. Attributing to in situ and continuous removal of water from the reaction system, the equilibrium limitation of CO2 conversion to methanol is broken, leading to a significant enhancement of CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of sequestrated CO2 to methanol can reduce CO2 emission and establish a sustainable carbon circuit. However, the transformation of CO2 into methanol is challenging because of the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and the deactivation of catalysts by water. In the present work, different reactor types have been evaluated for CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to methanol. Best results have been obtained in a bifunctional catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) based on a zeolite LTA membrane and a catalytic Cu&#8208;ZnO&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;ZrO2 layer on top. Due to the in situ and rapid removal of the produced water from the catalytic layer through the hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane, it is effective to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, thus significantly increasing the CO2 conversion (36.1&#8201;%) and methanol selectivity (100&#8201;%). Further, the catalyst deactivation by the produced water can be effectively inhibited, thus maintaining a high long&#8208;term activity of the CMR.

         <title>Precisely Engineered Supported Gold Clusters as a Stable Catalyst for Propylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable and selective Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst is synthesised for direct gas phase epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide, a key commodity chemical. The synthesis methodology is highly versatile for obtaining a stable, supported gold catalyst. The stabilising ligands play an important role in providing enhanced stability to the Au nanoparticles.







Abstract
Designing a stable and selective catalyst with high H2 utilisation is of pivotal importance for the direct gas&#8208;phase epoxidation of propylene. This work describes a facile one&#8208;pot methodology to synthesise ligand&#8208;stabilised sub&#8208;nanometre gold clusters immobilised onto a zeolitic support (TS&#8208;1) to engineer a stable Au/TS&#8208;1 catalyst. A non&#8208;thermal O2 plasma technique is used for the quick removal of ligands with limited increase in particle size. Compared to untreated Au/TS&#8208;1 catalysts prepared using the deposition precipitation method, the synthesised catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance, including 10 times longer lifetime (&gt;20&#8197;days), increased PO selectivity and hydrogen efficiency in direct gas phase epoxidation. The structure&#8208;stability relationship of the catalyst is illustrated using multiple characterisation techniques, such as XPS, 31P MAS NMR, DR&#8208;UV/VIS, HRTEM and TGA. It is hypothesised that the ligands play a guardian role in stabilising the Au particle size, which is vital in this reaction. This strategy is a promising approach towards designing a more stable heterogeneous catalyst.

         <title>The Controllable Reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Electrolyte and Potential Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOFs prior to CO2 electroreduction can be decoupled into two steps: 1)&#8197;electrolyte&#8208;mediated conversion of Bi&#8208;MOFs to Bi2O2CO3 by HCO3&#8722;&#8208;initiated ligand substitution, and 2)&#8197;potential&#8208;mediated reduction of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi. The first step controls the final morphology and structure, whilst the second step determines the final composition and valence states.







Abstract
Monitoring and controlling the reconstruction of materials under working conditions is crucial for the precise identification of active sites, elucidation of reaction mechanisms, and rational design of advanced catalysts. Herein, a Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) for electrochemical CO2 reduction is selected as a case study. In situ Raman spectra combined with ex situ electron microscopy reveal that the intricate reconstruction of the Bi&#8208;MOF can be controlled using two steps: 1)&#8197;electrolyte&#8208;mediated dissociation and conversion of Bi&#8208;MOF to Bi2O2CO3, and 2)&#8197;potential&#8208;mediated reduction of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi. The intentionally reconstructed Bi&#8197;catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and durability for formate production, and the unsaturated surface Bi&#8197;atoms formed during reconstruction become the active sites. This work emphasizes the significant impact of pre&#8208;catalyst reconstruction under working conditions and provides insight into the design of highly active and stable electrocatalysts through the regulation of these processes.

         <title>Synthesizing Photoluminescent Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 Nanoclusters with Structural Features by Using A Combined Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concurrently joint reduction&#8208;ligand induction method is introduced to synthesize a gold nanocluster Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the best PL quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably owing to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8722;Au bonds closely related to the structural features including tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two surface hexamer rings.







Abstract
We present a method for atomically precise nanocluster synthesis. As an illustration, we introduced the reducing&#8208;ligand induction combined method and synthesized a novel nanocluster, which was determined to be Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the same number of gold atoms as existing Au28(SR)20 nanoclusters but different ligands (hetero&#8208;composition&#8208;homo&#8208;size). Compared with the latter, the former has distinct properties and structures. In particular, a novel kernel evolution pattern is reported, i.e., the quasi&#8208;linear growth of Au4&#8208;tetrahedron by sharing one vertex and structural features, including a tritetrahedron kernel with two bridging thiolates and two Au6(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)6 hexamer chair&#8208;like rings on the kernel surface were also first reported, which endow Au28(SCH2Ph&#8208;tBu)22 with the best photoluminescence quantum yield among hydrophobic thiolated gold nanoclusters so far, probably due to the enhanced charge transfer from the bi&#8208;ring to the kernel via Au&#8722;Au bonds.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous Zn&#8208;storage behaviors of MoS2&#8208;based cathodes mainly rely on the ion&#8208;(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in&#8208;situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O&#8208;doping is proposed for MoS2 &#160;( designated as D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6 &#197;), and produce abundant 1T&#8208;phase. The tailored D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O featuring excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the three&#8208;dimensional Zn2+ transport along both the  ab  plane and  c&#8208;axis, thus achieving the exceptional high&#8208;rate capability. The feasible Zn2+ diffusion through the basal plane is verified by density functional theory computations. As a proof of concept, the wearable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn battery employing the D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O cathode operates stably even under severe bending conditions, showing great application prospects. This work opens a new window for designing high&#8208;performance layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;PROTAC Conjugates (APCs) for Tumor&#8208;specific Targeting in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is emerging as a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation. However, the drug development using the heterobifunctional PROTAC molecules is generally limited by poor membrane permeability, low in vivo efficacy and indiscriminate distribution. Herein an aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugation approach was developed as a novel strategy to improve the tumor&#8208;specific targeting ability and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. As proof of concept, the first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed by conjugating a BET&#8208;targeting PROTAC to the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 (AS) via a cleavable linker. Compared with the unmodified BET PROTAC, the designed molecule (APR) showed improved tumor targeting ability in a MCF&#8208;7 xenograft model, leading to enhanced in vivo BET degradation and antitumor potency and decreased toxicity. Thus, the APC strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in the development of PROTAC&#8208;based drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the occurrence of polysaccharides to the viral world: the case of Mimivirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general perception of viruses is that they are small in terms of size and genome, and that they hijack the host machinery to glycosylate their capsid. Giant viruses subvert all these concepts: their particles are not small, and their genome is more complex than that of some bacteria. Regarding glycosylation, this concept has been already challenged by the finding that Chloroviruses have an autonomous glycosylation machinery, that produces oligosaccharides similar in size to those of small viruses (6&#8208;12 units), albeit different in structure compared to the viral counterparts. We report herein that Mimivirus possesses a glycocalyx made of two different polysaccharides, now challenging the concept that all viruses coat their capsids with oligosaccharides of discrete size. This discovery contradicts the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses, blurring the boundaries between giant viruses and the cellular world and opening new avenues in the field of viral glycobiology.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Markovnikov Hydroxycarbonylation and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Vinyl Arenes: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropanoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydroxycarbonylation is one of the most fundamental yet challenging methods for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. Herein, we reported the development of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water. A monodentate phosphoramidite ligand  L6  plays vital role in the reaction. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups, and provides a facile and atom&#8208;economical approach to an array of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids including several commonly used non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The catalytic system has also enabled an asymmetric Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with alcohols to afford 2&#8208;arylpropanates. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the reactions proceed through a palladium&#8208;hydride pathway, the hydropalladation is irreversible and is the regio&#8208; and enantiodetermining step, while hydrolysis/alcoholysis is probably the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An enantioselective consecutive cyclization/coupling process, catalyzed by palladium is reported. Stereoinduction arises from an enantioselective carbopalladation, generating a product which promotes a nucleopalladation step.

         <title>Dynamic Catalytic Highly Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In dynamic covalent chemistry, reactions follow a thermodynamically controlled pathway through equilibria. Reversible covalent bond formation and breaking in a dynamic process enables the interconversion of products formed under kinetic control to thermodynamically more stable isomers. Notably, enantioselective catalysis of dynamic transformations has not been reported and applied in complex molecule synthesis. We describe the discovery of dynamic covalent enantioselective metal complex&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. We have developed a stereodivergent tandem synthesis of structurally and stereochemically complex molecules that sets eight stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity through asymmetric reversible bond formation in a dynamic process in two consecutive Ag&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylides with electron poor olefins. Time dependent reversible dynamic covalent bond formation gives enantiodivergent and diastereodivergent access to structurally complex double cycloadducts with high selectivity from a common set of reagents.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient tandem catalysis method is achieved for the direct conversion of alcohol&#8208;containing alkynyl anilines to valuable chiral 2,3&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles. This method relies on a tandem indolization followed by enantioconvergent substitution of alcohols via borrowing hydrogen to construct two rings in one step, enabled by relay and cooperative catalysis of a chiral iridium complex with a chiral phosphoric acid. Highly diastereoselective transformations of the tricyclic indole products also provide efficient access to a diverse array of complex polycyclic indoline compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Revision of the unstable picrotoxinin hydrolysis product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization  &#160;in situ  . Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation of Racemic Diastereomers: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Michael&#8208;Henry Reactions to Afford Spirooxindoles Bearing Furan&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) reactions of racemic diastereomer mixtures that afford the products as essentially single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities are described. We demonstrated the DYKAT in the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused rings. The starting materials of the DYKAT, dihydrobenzofuranone derivatives, were synthesized in racemic diastereomer mixtures, and these were transformed to the spirooxindole derivatives in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities through Michael&#8208;Henry cascade reactions with nitrostyrenes under organocatalytic conditions. In the reactions, regardless the stereochemistry of the starting materials, all the four isomers were transformed to single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities, and four new chiral centers were created.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistage Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Host&#8208;Guest Doping Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with inorganic long&#8208;lasting luminescent materials, organic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) ones show several advantages, such as flexibility, transparency, solubility and color adjustability. However, organic RTP materials close to commercialization are still to be developed. In this work, we developed a new host&#8208;guest doping system with stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics, in which triphenylphosphine oxide (  OPph  3  ) acted host and benzo(dibenzo)phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as guests. Turn&#8208;on RTP effect was realized by mixing them together through co&#8208;crystallization or grinding, in which the efficient energy transfer from host to guest and the strong intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the guest have played significant role. Further on, multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved  via  introducing pyridine group into the guest molecule. In addition, the anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized for these materials through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing, which brings RTP materials closer to commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Molecular Nanocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons have attracted increasing interest of late due to their fascinating structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties. This Review examines recent innovations in solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;assisted methods for their synthesis that have enabled the unprecedented exploration of these unique molecular architectures, as well as the intriguing properties of the nanocarbons obtained.







Abstract
Molecular nanocarbons containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behavior, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing. Heptagon incorporation can not only induce negative curvature within nanocarbon scaffolds, but also confer significantly altered properties through interaction with adjacent non&#8208;hexagonal rings. Despite the disclosure of several beautiful examples in recent years, synthetic strategies toward heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons remain relatively limited due to the intrinsic challenges of heptagon formation and incorporation into polyarene frameworks. In this Review, recent advances in solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons, as well as the intriguing properties of these frameworks, will be discussed.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed C&#8722;H functionalization has been realized to achieve borylation at a distal position of aliphatic amines. The oxidative borylation at the distal &#948;&#8208;position of aliphatic amines is achieved using various borylating agents, a palladium catalyst, and a rightly tuned ligand in the presence of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H&#8208;activated intermediate has been isolated and crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
Directed C&#8722;H functionalization has been realized as a complimentary technique to achieve borylation at a distal position of aliphatic amines. Here, we demonstrated the oxidative borylation at the distal &#948;&#8208;position of aliphatic amines using various borylating agents, a palladium catalyst, and a rightly tuned ligand in the presence of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H&#8208;activated intermediate has been isolated and crystallographically characterized to get mechanistic insight.

         <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Photodetachment of Amino Acid Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospraying allows bringing &#8220;molecular elephants&#8221; into the gas phase, as phrased by J.&#8197;B. Fenn, where subsequent chirality analysis&#8212;in the current example via photoelectron circular dichroism resulting from photodetachment from anions&#8212;reveals the chirality of enantiomers present.







Abstract
The chirality of chemical compounds is of undisputed importance in science and technology. In particular with respect to pharmacological application most molecules of interest cannot be accessed by the powerful techniques developed in recent years for gas phase analytes. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) with the detection of photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) provides access to chirality information applicable to molecular materials with negligible vapor pressure, for example, amino acids. To this end, glutamic acid and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) have been electrosprayed into the source of a chirality spectrometer, where photodetachment is enforced and the PECD is detected. The technique can be expected to be conceptually applicable to all chemical systems with chirality based on molecular properties.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Intrablock Cross&#8208;Linking of Linear Diblock Copolymer to Realize Janus&#8208;Shaped Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking protocol was demonstrated to achieve a rapid and facile synthesis of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs) from the various diblock copolymers bearing one particular cross&#8208;linkable functionality across the entire polymer chain. Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP produce significantly small microphase&#8208;separated structure.







Abstract
Developing an efficient and versatile process to transform a single linear polymer chain into a shape&#8208;defined nanoobject is a major challenge in the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology to replicate sophisticated biological functions of proteins and nucleic acids in a synthetic polymer system. In this study, we performed one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking of linear block copolymers (BCPs) to realize single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus&#8208;shaped SCNPs). Detailed structural characterizations of the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP composed of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(glycolic acid) revealed its compactly folded conformation and compartmentalized block localization, similar to the self&#8208;folded tertiary structures of natural proteins. Versatility of the one&#8208;shot intrablock cross&#8208;linking was demonstrated using several different BCP precursors. In addition, the Janus&#8208;shaped SCNP produce miniscule microphase&#8208;separated structures.

&lt;p&gt;Developing an efficient and versatile process to transform a single linear polymer chain into a shape-defined nanoobject is a major challenge in the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology to replicate sophisticated biological functions of proteins and nucleic acids in a synthetic polymer system. In this study, we performed one-shot intrablock cross-linking of linear block copolymers (BCPs) to realize single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with two chemically compartmentalized domains (Janus-shaped SCNPs). Detailed structural characterizations of the Janus-shaped SCNP composed of polystyrene-block-poly(glycolic acid) revealed its compactly folded conformation and compartmentalized block localization, similar to the self-folded tertiary structures of natural proteins. Versatility of the one-shot intrablock cross-linking was demonstrated using several different BCP precursors. In addition, the Janus-shaped SCNP produce miniscule microphase-separated structures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organocatalytic enantioselective construction of chiral azepine skeleton bearing multiple&#8208;stereogenic elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective construction of molecules bearing multiple stereogenic elements is increasingly related to the synthesis of enantiopure natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. However, atom&#8208;economical and enantioselective approaches to install multiple stereogenic elements in a small molecular template by limited chemical transformation remain challenging. We describe an organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules bearing four types of stereogenic elements in fused azepines via vinylidene  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (  VQM  )&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution. This method was proved robust with a wide range of substrate scope (46&#8208;92% yield), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) and enantioselectivity achieved (up to 97% ee). Optical properties and Ru  3+  &#8208;induced fluorescence responses of these compounds suggest their potential applications in optoelectronic materials and heavy metal ion detection.</dc:description>

         <title>A Trapezoidal Octacyanoquinoid Acceptor Forms Solution and Surface Products by Antiparallel Shape Fitting with Conformational Dipole Momentum Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new compound formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units is synthesized. Such species features an in&#8208;plane to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane switch of the electric dipole momentum upon adsorption and self&#8208;assembly on Au(111).







Abstract
A new compound (1) formed by two antiparallelly disposed tetracyano thienoquinoidal units has been synthesized and studied by electrochemistry, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR, IR, EPR, and transient spectroscopy. Self&#8208;assembly of 1 on a Au(111) surface has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. Experiments have been rationalized by quantum chemical calculations. 1 exhibits a unique charge distribution in its anionic form, with a gradient of charge yielding a neat molecular in&#8208;plane electric dipole momentum, which transforms out&#8208;of&#8208;plane after surface deposition due to twisted&#8594;folded conformational change and to partial charge transfer from Au(111). Intermolecular van der Waals interactions and antiparallel trapezoidal shape fitting lead to the formation of an optimal dense on Au(111) two&#8208;dimensional assembly of 1.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic Cofactor Regeneration Coupled to CO2 Fixation in a Redox&#8208;Active Hydrogel for Stereoselective C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrified CO2 fixation switched on! In a bioelectrocatalytic approach an NADPH recycling module and a C&#8722;C bond formation module were co&#8208;immobilized within a viologen&#8208;based redox hydrogel. This enabled the regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO2 into crotonyl&#8208;CoA, yielding the most complex product known in bioelectrocatalytic CO2 conversion so far.







Abstract
The sustainable capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) is key to achieving a circular carbon economy. Bioelectrocatalysis, which aims at using renewable energies to power the highly specific, direct transformation of CO2 into value added products, holds promise to achieve this goal. However, the functional integration of CO2&#8208;fixing enzymes onto electrode materials for the electrosynthesis of stereochemically complex molecules remains to be demonstrated. Here, we show the electricity&#8208;driven regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO2 into crotonyl&#8208;CoA by an NADPH&#8208;dependent enzymatic reductive carboxylation. Co&#8208;immobilization of a ferredoxin NADP+ reductase and crotonyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase/reductase within a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;viologen&#8208;modified hydrogel enabled iterative NADPH recycling and stereoselective formation of (2S)&#8208;ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, a prospective intermediate towards multi&#8208;carbon products from CO2, with 92&#177;6&#8201;% faradaic efficiency and at a rate of 1.6&#177;0.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This approach paves the way for realizing even more complex bioelectrocatalyic cascades in the future.

         <title>Regulation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Emission Channels by Controlling the Excited&#8208;States Dynamics via J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates significantly reduce the energy gap between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and contribute to the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process; while H&#8208;aggregates will accelerate ISC and suppresses radiation transition of S1 to realize phosphorescence. This provides crucial information for deeply understand of the internal mechanism of the excited state dynamics controlled by different aggregates.







Abstract
Control of excited&#8208;state dynamics is key in tuning room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions but is challenging for organic luminescent materials (OLMs). We show the regulation of TADF and RTP emissions of a boron difluoride &#946;&#8208;acetylnaphthalene chelate (&#946;CBF2) by controlling the excited&#8208;state dynamics via its J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation states. Two crystalline polymorphs emitting green and red light have been controllably obtained. Although both monoclinic, the green and red crystals are dominated by J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation, respectively, owing to different molecular packing arrangements. J&#8208;aggregation significantly reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states for ultra&#8208;fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and enhances the radiative singlet decay, together leading to TADF. The H&#8208;aggregation accelerates the ISC and suppresses the radiative singlet decay, helping to stabilize the triplet exciton for RTP.

         <title>Holistic View on Materials Development: Water Electrolysis as a Case Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of a circular economy, the design process of new materials has to change. The performance&#8208;based mindset must be replaced by a holistic approach to efficient materials. For this transition, the collaboration between materials science and sustainability assessment must be improved, and new ways of including assessments into design processes and standardized figures of sustainable merit must be defined.







Abstract
In view of rising ecological awareness, materials development is primarily aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of innovative and more elaborate materials. However, a materials performance figure of merit should include essential aspects of materials: environmental impact, economic constraints, technical feasibility, etc. Thus, we promote the inclusion of sustainability criteria already during the materials design process. With such a holistic design approach, new products may be more likely to meet the circular economy requirements than when traditional development strategies are pursued. Using catalysts for water electrolysis as an example, we present a modelling method based on experimental data to holistically evaluate processes.

         <title>Correlating Charge Transport Properties of Conjugated Polymers in Solution Aggregates and Thin&#8208;Film Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of solution aggregates on the charge transport process of conjugated polymers in electronic devices has gained increasing attention; however, the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities in the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains elusive. Herein, three polymers, FBDOPV&#8208;2T, FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T, and FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T, are designed and synthesized, and exhibit distinct aggregation behavior in solution. By combining contact&#8208;free ultrafast Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor measurements, we track the charge carrier mobility of the aggregates of these polymers from the solution to thin&#8208;film states. Remarkably, the mobility of three polymers is found to follow nearly the same trend (FBDOPV&#8208;2T &gt; FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T &gt; &gt; FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T) in both solution and thin&#8208;film states. The quantitative mobility correlation indicates that the charge transport properties of solution aggregates play a critical role in determining the thin&#8208;film charge transport properties and final device performance. Our results highlight the importance of investigating and controlling solution aggregation structures towards efficient organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B&#8322;cat&#8322; has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni(0) catalysts.&#160;The key to achieve  this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of  B&#8322;cat&#8322; as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8208;O bond to Ni(0) catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron&#8208;promoted  carboxylic acid  activation is also applicable to  other types of reactions  .</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds RS&#8208;mandelic acid (MAN) and RS&#8208;etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R&#8208;MAN&#183;R&#8208;ETI and S&#8208;MAN&#183;S&#8208;ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve both compounds. The developed process leads to excellent enantiopurity both for etiracetam (ee&gt;98%) and mandelic acid (ee~95%) enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Amplification of the Afterglow Luminescent Nanoreporter Enables  to  Predict Anti&#8208;cancer Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;associated immunogenicity evoked through reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an efficient way to fight against the&#160;immune&#8208;dysfunctional microenvironment, so as to provoke potent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the unknown ROS dose during cancer therapies may induce adverse immune responses (e.g., insufficient ICD, toxicity toward normal tissues or immune system). Herein, we developed a novel cyclic amplification method for an organic afterglow nanoreporter for the real&#8208;time visualization of self&#8208;generated ROS. First, we promoted semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFODBT) as a novel candidate for emitting near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescence. Second, the introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate (CPPO) into PFODBT (PFODBT@CPPO) resulted in a significant enhancement of afterglow intensity through the dual cyclic amplification pathway involving singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). Third,  1  O  2  produced by PFODBT@CPPO&#160;induced cancer cell necrosis and promoted the release of damage&#8208;related molecular patterns, thereby evoking ICD&#8208;associated immune responses through ROS&#8208;based oxidative stress. Notably, the afterglow luminescent signals of the nanoreporter were well correlated with light&#8208;driven  1  O  2  generation and anti&#8208;cancer efficiency, respectively. Overall, our imaging strategy provided a non&#8208;invasive tool for predicting the degree of ICD that occurs during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy, which may contribute to precise immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis as Efficient Tool for the Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydroxamic Acids for Acyl Nitroso Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acyl nitroso Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with electrochemically oxidised hydroxamic acids is described. By using alternating current electrolysis, their typical electro&#8208;induced decomposition could be suppressed in favour of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine cycloaddition products. The reaction was optimised using Design of Experiments (DoE) and a sensitivity test was conducted. A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3&#8208;dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96% isolated yield.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides are an important class of carbohydrates and pose unique synthetic challenge. A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of  C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8208;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary. Both the &#947;&#160;C&#8208;H bond of allylamines and the &#948; C&#8208;H bond of homoallyl amine substrates can be glycosylated in high efficiency and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The resulting  C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides can be further converted to a variety of  C  &#8208;alkyl glycosides with high stereospecificity. These reactions offer a broadly applicable method to streamline the synthesis of complex  C  &#8208;vinyl glycosides from easily accessible starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Tracking and Sensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ with a Single SERS Probe in the Live Brain: Toward Understanding Why Copper Ions Were Increased upon Ischemia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imbalance of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in the brain is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, it still lacks of effective analytical methods for simultaneously determining the concentrations of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  . Herein, we created a novel SERS probe (CuSP) to real&#8208;time track and accurately quantify extracellular concentrations of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in the live brain. The present CuSP probe demonstrated specific ability for recognition of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in a dual&#8208;recognition mode. Then, a microarray consisting of 8 CuSP probes with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution and good accuracy was constructed for tracking and simultaneously biosensing of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  in the cerebral cortex of living brain. Using our powerful tool, it was found that that the concentrations of Cu  2+  and Cu  +  were increased by ~4.26 and ~1.80 times upon ischemia, respectively. Three routes were first discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu  +  and Cu  2+  during ischemia.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Poly&#8208;oxalate Electrolytes Stabilizing both Anode and Cathode Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li/NMC811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of F&#8208;terminated poly&#8208;oxalate structures were prepared, in which, the odd&#8208;carbon&#8208;diol precursors endow higher Li+ conductivity, the terminal trifluoroacetate units not only help to generate a LiF&#8208;based passivating layer with the Li&#8208;metal anode, but also improve the antioxidative capability, with which, the cycling performance of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal/NMC811 cells was significantly improved.







Abstract
The relatively narrow electrochemical steady window and low ionic conductivity are two critical challenges for Li+&#8208;conducting solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). Here, a family of poly&#8208;oxalate(POE) structures were prepared as SPE; among them, POEs composed from diols with an odd number of carbons show higher ionic conductivity than those composed from diols with an even number of carbons, and the POE composed from propanediol (C5&#8208;POE) has the highest Li+ conductivity. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) electrons of POE were found located on the terminal units. When using trifluoroacetate as the terminating unit (POE&#8208;F), not only does the HOMO become more negative, but also the HOMO electrons shift to the middle oxalate units, improving the antioxidative capability. Furthermore, the interfacial compatibility across the Li&#8208;metal/POE&#8208;F is also improved by the generation of a LiF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interlayer(SEI). With the trifluoroacetate&#8208;terminated C5&#8208;POE (C5&#8208;POE&#8208;F) as the electrolyte and Li+&#8208;conducting binder in the cathode, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2(NMC811) cells showed significantly improved stability than the counterpart with poly&#8208;ether, providing a promising candidate for the forthcoming all&#8208;solid&#8208;state high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probe for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of ratiometric imaging techniques to quantitatively measure hypoxia levels  in vivo  is essential in predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments and diagnostics. With complementary advantages of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging, NIRF/PA dual&#8208;ratiometric probes are imperative for precisely visualizing tumor hypoxia levels. However, because the absorbed excitation energy is fixed in a single chromophore, its NIRF and PA effects are always competitive, which greatly thwarts the development of NIRF/PA dual&#8208;ratiometric probes. Herein, for the first time, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual&#8208;ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO  2  which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia  in vivo  . AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO  2  , composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene&#8208;hemicyanine (AS&#8208;Cy) and a 4&#8208;nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10&#8208;fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I  773  /I  733  ) and 2.4&#8208;fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA  730  /PA  670  ) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study not only presents the first dual ratiometric NIRF and PA probe for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels but also provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for applying in dual ratiometric imaging of other disease&#8208;relevant biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>The Enantioselective Synthesis of Eburnamonine, Eucophylline, and 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;Leucophyllidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;convergent&#8211;divergent&#8221; strategy was used to synthesize the dimeric natural product leucophyllidine. An enantioenriched lactam building block was advanced in a divergent fashion to complete syntheses of both eburnamonine and eucophylline in 10 and 16 steps, respectively. A convergent cross&#8208;coupling and hydrogenation sequence was then employed to afford 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;leucophyllidine (see scheme).







Abstract
A synthetic approach to the heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid leucophyllidine is disclosed herein. An enantioenriched lactam building block, synthesized through palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation, served as the precursor to both hemispheres. The eburnamonine&#8208;derived fragment was synthesized through a Bischler&#8211;Napieralski/hydrogenation approach, while the eucophylline&#8208;derived fragment was synthesized by Friedl&#228;nder quinoline synthesis and two sequential C&#8722;H functionalization steps. A convergent Stille coupling and phenol&#8208;directed hydrogenation united the two monomeric fragments to afford 16&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;leucophyllidine in 21 steps from commercial material.

         <title>Tight Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport via Molecular Precursor Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular precursor engineering was implemented for modular fabrication of covalent organic framework (COFs) membranes. The COFs membranes fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process with more hydrophilic aldehyde precursors exhibited tighter structure than the COFs membranes fabricated via interfacial polymerization process with less hydrophilic aldehydes, thus achieving the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity.







Abstract
Fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membranes with tight structure, which can fully utilize well&#8208;defined framework structure and thus achieve superior conduction performance, remains a grand challenge. Herein, through molecular precursor engineering of COFs, we reported the fabrication of tight COFs membrane with the ever&#8208;reported highest hydroxide ion conductivity over 200&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 100&#8201;% RH. Six quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized COFs were synthesized by assembling functional hydrazides and different aldehyde precursors. In an organic&#8208;aqueous reaction system, the impact of the aldehyde precursors with different size, electrophilicity and hydrophilicity on the reaction&#8208;diffusion process for fabricating COFs membranes was elucidated. Particularly, more hydrophilic aldehydes were prone to push the reaction zone from the interface region to the aqueous phase of the reaction system, the tight membranes were thus fabricated via phase&#8208;transfer polymerization process, conferring around 4&#8211;8 times the anion conductivity over the loose membranes via interfacial polymerization process.

         <title>Cycloaddition Cascades of Strained Alkynes and Oxadiazinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational and experimental study on the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is reported. Mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs whereas the use of arynes leads to symmetrical PAHs, are investigated. Experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds.







Abstract
We report a computational and experimental study of the reaction of oxadiazinones and strained alkynes to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The reaction proceeds by way of a pericyclic reaction cascade and leads to the formation of four new carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. Using M06&#8208;2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non&#8208;aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.

Using M06-2X DFT calculations, we interrogate several mechanistic aspects of the reaction, such as why the use of non-aromatic strained alkynes can be used to access unsymmetrical PAHs, whereas the use of arynes in the methodology leads to symmetrical PAHs. In addition, experimental studies enable the rapid synthesis of new PAHs, including tetracene and pentacene scaffolds. These studies not only provide fundamental insight regarding the aforementioned cycloaddition cascades and synthetic access to PAH scaffolds, but are also expected to enable the synthesis of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;based Photodynamic Agents for Exclusively Generating Superoxide Radical over Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers are considered as an efficient approach to overcome the deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) for hypoxic tumors. However, it remains a challenge to design photosensitizers for generating reactive oxygen species by the Type&#8208;I process. Herein, we report a series of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;linked BODIPY dimers and a trimer that exclusively generate superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) by the Type&#8208;I process upon light irradiation. The triplet formation originates from an effective excited&#8208;state relaxation from the initially populated singlet (S1) to triplet (T1) states via an intermediate triplet (T2) state. The low reduction potential and ultralong lifetime of the T1 state facilitate the efficient generation of O2&#8722;&#8226; by inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer to molecular oxygen. The T1&#8208;S0 energy gap is smaller than that of O2 thereby precluding the generation of singlet oxygen by the Type&#8208;II process. The trimer exhibits superior PDT performance under the hypoxic environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report on rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial &#8216;fingerprint&#8217; output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The suggested bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high&#8208;sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin is the frontrunner for substituting toxic lead in perovskite solar cells. However, tin suffers the detrimental oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV). Most of reported strategies employ SnF  2  in the perovskite precursor solution to prevent Sn(IV) formation. Nevertheless, the working mechanism of this additive remains debated. To further elucidate it, we investigate the fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites by complementary analytical tools. NMR of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for Sn(IV) over Sn(II), selectively complexing it as SnF  4  . Hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF  4  than SnI  4  to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of Sn(IV) in the film. Finally, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization. Combining these analytical tools, we provide a complete picture of fluoride's working mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Induction in Buckminsterfullerene Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is one of the most symmetrical molecules. Nanoconfinement of C60 within a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) are able to perturb the inherent symmetry of C60 via the host&#8211;guest interactions. As a consequent, C60 confined in the MOF exhibited unprecedented substantial chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Chiral induction is an emerging topic of interest in various areas of chemistry because of its relationship to the elusive mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) with the shape of a highly symmetric truncated icosahedron has rarely been referred for chiral induction due to the difficult symmetry breaking. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can provide a key field for chiral induction. C60 could be incorporated into the chiral nanochannels of the MOF using an in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy. The circular dichroism spectra of the resulting nanocomposites showed an intense chiral signal in the absorption region of C60. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that this unprecedented chiral induction of C60 was attributed to hybridization of the molecular orbitals through a close association with the pore surface of the MOF. Our method can endow highly symmetric achiral compounds with chirality, paving the new way toward fabrication of novel chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Selective Bacterial Targeting and Infection&#8208;Triggered Release of Antibiotic Colistin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional peptide&#8211;colistin conjugate for the treatment of bacterial infections has been synthesized. The conjugate binds to E.&#8197;coli bacteria by an all&#8208;d sequence of the human peptide ubiquicidin29&#8211;41. Host immune cells, activated upon infection, secrete the enzyme neutrophil elastase that cleaves an optimized linker sequence to release free colistin, a potent antibiotic that kills the bacteria.







Abstract
In order to render potent, but toxic antibiotics more selective, we have explored a novel conjugation strategy that includes drug accumulation followed by infection&#8208;triggered release of the drug. Bacterial targeting was achieved using a modified fragment of the human antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin, as demonstrated by fluorophore&#8208;tagged variants. To limit the release of the effector colistin only to infection&#8208;related situations, we introduced a linker that was cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme secreted by neutrophil granulocytes at infection sites. The linker carried an optimized sequence of amino acids that was required to assure sufficient cleavage efficiency. The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1&#8208; or the 3&#8208;position of colistin. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept was achieved in co&#8208;cultures of primary human neutrophils and Escherichia coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.

The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1- or the 3-position of colistin. A proof-of-concept was achieved in co-cultures of primary human neutrophils and Escherichia coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and&#160;coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8211;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atomic Insight into the Chemical Origin and Variation of Dielectric Constant in Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding in solution chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs,  N01  and  N02  , which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(  n  &#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;  b  :4,5&#8208;  b'  ]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10  H  &#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10  H  &#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. Very interestingly, the results from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions show that different alkyl substituents with/without bromine termination can render the molecules to self&#8208;assemble distinctively due to varied dipole&#8208;dipole interactions among adjacent molecules. Particularly, the  N01  molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. Consequently,  N01  as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85%.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective and Rapid Removal of Polar Organic Micropollutants from Water by Amide Naphthotube&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption&#8208;mediated processes. Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8208;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp  2  ], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;  5  &#8208;Cp)(&#951;  1  &#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;  5  &#8644; &#951;  3  shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#180;] + BeX  2  in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr  2  and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C  9  H  7  )  2  ] (  1  ) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe  3  )  2  C  9  H  5  }Br] (  2  ). The former displays &#951;  5  /&#951;  1  &#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that a &#951;  5  /&#951;  5  &#8208;conformation is less than 5 kcal mol  &#8211;1  higher in energy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases. However, current DAA detection strategies mainly rely on bulky instrumentation or electrochemical probes, limiting their cellular and animal applications. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;coupled nanoprobe that can detect enantiospecific DAAs through synergistic energy transfer. This nanoprobe offers near&#8208;infrared upconversion capability, a wide dynamic detection range, and a detection limit of 2.2 &#956;M, providing a versatile platform for  in vivo  noninvasive detection of DAAs with high enantioselectivity. These results potentially allow real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecular handedness in living animals, as well as developing antipsychotic treatment strategies  .</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Ion Batteries Achieved by a Low&#8208;Cost Glucose Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost glucose additive into traditional ZnSO4 electrolyte can greatly inhibit the dendrite growth on Zn anodes in Zn ion batteries by simultaneously modulating the solvation shell in the electrolyte and electrode interface.







Abstract
Dendrite growth and by&#8208;products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their development as promising energy storage devices. We utilize a low&#8208;cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO4 electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high&#8208;performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, we show that the glucose in ZnSO4 aqueous environment can simultaneously modulate solvation structure of Zn2+ and Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering can alternate one H2O molecule from the primary Zn2+&#8208;6H2O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, a symmetric cell and Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>Molecular Basis for Two Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alderases that Produce Decalin Skeletons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powerful combination of experimental methods and calculations highlights the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions catalyzed by a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds. Our proposed mechanism would open a new window on the enzymatic [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
Enzymes catalyzing [4+2] cycloaddition have attracted increasing attention because of their key roles in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we solved the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular [4+2] cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds during biosynthesis of the HIV&#8208;1 integrase inhibitor equisetin and its stereochemical opposite, phomasetin. Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state&#8208;like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein&#8208;substrate interactions. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.

         <title>Electrochromic Polycationic Organoboronium Macrocycles with Multiple Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycationic organoboronium macrocycles comprising four bipyridylboronium units in a cyclic conjugated framework are introduced, with the boron cations linked by fluorene and two electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or two electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that multiple redox states can be reversibly accessed with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons and switchable electrochromic properties are realized.







Abstract
Polycationic macrocycles are attractive as they display unique molecular switching capabilities arising from their redox properties. Although diverse polycationic macrocycles have been developed, those based on cationic boron systems remain very limited. We present herein the development of novel polycationic macrocycles by introducing organoboronium moieties into a conjugated organoboron macrocyclic framework. These macrocycles consist of four bipyridylboronium units that are connected by fluorene and either electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Electrochemical studies reveal that the macrocycles undergo reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons. Switchable electrochromic behavior is demonstrated via spectroelectrochemical studies and the observed color changes are rationalized by correlation with computed electronic transitions using DFT methods.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Methane to a Methyl Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane is aerobically converted to an oxidation&#8208;resistant methyl ester in high yields with a solid cobalt&#8208;containing catalyst at a moderate temperature and pressure. Improved reaction conditions result from the dilution of the trifluoroacetic acid in an inert perfluoroalkane co&#8208;solvent. The fluorous character of the solvent enables the facile recovery of the product ester through a simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction with non&#8208;fluorous solvent.







Abstract
A promising strategy to break through the selectivity&#8208;conversion limit of direct methane conversion to achieve high yields is the protection of methanol via esterification to a more stable methyl ester. We present an aerobic methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester approach that utilizes a highly dispersed, cobalt&#8208;containing solid catalyst, along with significantly more favorable reaction conditions compared to existing homogeneously&#8208;catalyzed approaches (e.g. diluted acid, O2 oxidant, moderate temperature and pressure). The trifluoroacetic acid medium is diluted (&lt;25&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with an inert fluorous co&#8208;solvent that can be recovered after the separation of the methyl trifluoroacetate via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction at ambient conditions. Silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalysts are highly active in this system, with competitive yields and turnovers in comparison to known aerobic transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Mitochondrial MicroRNAs via Optically Programmable Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optically controlled DNA nanoreporter technology was reported for imaging of mitochondrial microRNAs in vitro and in vivo. This was accomplished by mitochondria&#8208;targeted localization and near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;initiated programmable strand displacement reactions.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) functions are tightly regulated by their sub&#8208;compartmental location in living cells, and the ability to imaging of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs) is essential for understanding of the related pathological processes. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based methods could not be used for this purpose. Here, we report the development of a DNA nanoreporter technology for imaging of mitomiRs in living cells through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNA strand displacement reactions. The sensing function of the DNA nanoreporters are silent (OFF) during the delivery process, but can be photoactivated (ON) with NIR light after targeted mitochondrial localization, enabling spatially&#8208;restricted imaging of two types of cancer&#8208;related mitomiRs with improved detection accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate imaging of mitomiRs in vivo through spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled delivery and activation. Therefore, this study illustrates a simple methodology that may be broadly applicable for investigating the mitomiRs&#8208;associated physiological events.

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aminocatalytic oxidative umpolung strategy for asymmetric etherification of the &#945;&#8208;position of branched aldehydes is presented. The protocol avoids pre&#8208;functionalization and employs commercially available oxygen nucleophiles. Polarity inversion proceeds via an aminocatalytic SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution of in situ generated racemic quinone adducts.







Abstract
Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogues, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified p&#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners. p&#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91&#8201;% ee, following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95&#8201;% ee. Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports a mechanism proceeding via an SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution.

     alt="Enantioselective &#945;-Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aminocatalytic oxidative umpolung strategy for asymmetric etherification of the &#945;-position of branched aldehydes is presented. The protocol avoids pre-functionalization and employs commercially available oxygen nucleophiles. Polarity inversion proceeds via an aminocatalytic S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 dynamic-kinetic resolution of in situ generated racemic quinone adducts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogues, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;-position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;-position of racemic &#945;-branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen-based nucleophiles and an amino acid-derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners. &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;-aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, following either a one-step or a two-step, one-pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports a mechanism proceeding via an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 dynamic-kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;-position of aldehydes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Synergistically Enhanced Hyperpolarizability: Chiral Coordination Polymers with Nonpolar Structures Exhibiting Unusually Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically synthesized new noncentrosymmetric nonpolar chiral coordination polymers exhibit unusually strong second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiencies attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and increased hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the robust hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.







Abstract
Four chiral coordination polymers (CPs), M[(S,S)&#8208;C14H14N2O6] and M[(R,R)&#8208;C14H14N2O6] (M=Zn or Cd), have been exclusively synthesized in high yields with the aid of newly designed chiral ligand under hydrothermal condition. The CPs crystallizing in the orthorhombic nonpolar space group, C2221, reveal three&#8208;dimensional framework structures composed of MO4 tetrahedra and the corresponding homochiral linkers. Powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that the nonpolar CPs reveal very strong SHG efficiency of ca. 5&#8211;9 times that of KH2PO4 and exhibit type&#8208;I phase&#8208;matching behavior. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the unusually large SHG efficiency found from the nonpolar CPs should be attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and enhanced hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8208;acceptor system originating from the hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Carboxylate Ligands on Layered Double Hydroxides/Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Promote the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs demonstrate a synergistic effect. As a Lewis base the carboxylate ligands promote the sluggish OER by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of OH&#8722; ions, while also facilitating intrinsic electron redistribution and a partially distorted octahedral structure.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate ligands as co&#8208;catalysts are very efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in&#8208;situ&#8208;transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. We reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate an abundant high&#8208;valence state of nickel species with a partially distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d&#8208;band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of the intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in&#8197;situ Raman and FTIR spectra reveal that the surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH&#8722;).

         <title>Tricomponent Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymers with Tunable Composition via Sequential Seeded Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of tricomponent supramolecular block copolymers with tunable microstructure is demonstrated by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization fluorescent core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide derivatives.







Abstract
Synthesis of supramolecular block co&#8208;polymers (BCP) with small monomers and predictive sequence requires elegant molecular design and synthetic strategies. Herein we report the unparalleled synthesis of tri&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs with tunable microstructure by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomers. Core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivatives with different core substitutions and appended with &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide side chains provide perfect monomer design with spectral complementarity, pathway complexity and minimal structural mismatch to synthesize and characterize the multi&#8208;component BCPs. The distinct fluorescent nature of various cNDI monomers aids the spectroscopic probing of the seeded growth process and the microscopic visualization of resultant supramolecular BCPs using Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization presented here is reminiscent of the multi&#8208;step synthesis of covalent BCPs via living chain polymerization. These findings provide a promising platform for constructing unique functional organic heterostructures for various optoelectronic and catalytic applications.

         <dc:description>Half&#8208;metallic materials are theoretically predicted to be metallic and insulating, which have not been confirmed experimentally, and the predictions are still in doubt. We report&#160; the&#160; resistance&#8208;chiral anisotropy (R&#8208;ChA), i.e., chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity, in chiral mesostructured Fe  3  O  4  &#160;films (CMFFs)&#160;grown on&#160; the&#160; substrates&#160;  via  &#160;a hydrothermal method using amino acids as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. Two levels of chirality exist in the CMFFs: primary distortion of the crystal lattice forms twisted nanoflakes, and secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes forms fan&#8208;shaped nanoplates. At temperatures below 30 K, the CMFFs exhibited metallic conductivity and insulation for one handedness and the other, respectively. The chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields were speculated to stabilize the opposite spin in the antipodal chiral frame , which &#160;led to the free transport of electrons in one handedness of the chiral structure and immobility for the other handedness.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24  framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24  framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation and hydroboration of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a cobalt catalyst generated from Co(acac)  2  and (  R,R  )&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A variety of terminal alkynes undergo this asymmetric transformation, affording the corresponding  gem  &#8208;(borylsilyl)alkane products with high enantioselectivity (up to 98%  ee  ). This one&#8208;pot reaction combines (  E  )&#8208;selective hydrosiylation of alkynes and consecutive enantioselective hydroboration of (  E  )&#8208;vinylsilanes with one chiral cobalt catalyst.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials Afford Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9%, along with 86% efficiency retention after 1000 h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0% with a record area of 27 cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;order Nonlinear Optical Effects in 1D Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites Bulk Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of chirality into organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) is expected to achieve excellent photoelectric and nonlinear materials related to circular dichroism. Chirality&#8208;dependent circular photogalvanic effect and spin transport have already been studied in OIHPs. However, chirality&#8208;dependent second harmonic generation (SHG) is rarely studied in bulk single crystal of OIHPs. Due to the existence of asymmetric center and intrinsic chirality in the chiral OIHPs, the different efficiencies of SHG signal occurs when the circularly polarized light (CPL) with different phases passes through the chiral crystal, which is defined as second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Here, the SHG&#8208;CD effect has been successfully developed in bulk single crystals chiral one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(  R  /  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;aminopiperidine]PbI  4  , which crystallize in a chiral space group  P  2  1  2  1  2  1  . More importantly, it is the first time to distinguish CPL using chirality&#8208;dependent SHG&#8208;CD effect in OIHPs bulk single crystals. Furthermore, such SHG&#8208;CD technology breaks through the conventional CPL detection using chiral semiconductor, thus extending the detection range to near infrared region (NIR). In this way, the anisotropy factor (g  SHG&#8208;CD  ) through SHG&#8208;CD signal is as high as 0.21. The results not only expand the applications of chiral OIHPs in nonlinear optics (NLO) field, but also provide a new method to distinguish the CPL in NIR.</dc:description>

         <title>Polysulfates Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Uptake through Electrostatic Interactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15870-15878, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the positively charged patches of RBD of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and block viral interaction with host cells for infection inhibition. The synthetic linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) exhibits higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin, but lower anticoagulant activity. Therefore, it is considered to be a promising substitute for heparin in clinical applications.







Abstract
Here we report that negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 via electrostatic interactions. Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with an IC50 of 67&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (approx. 1.6&#8197;&#956;m). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60&#8208;fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC50: 4084&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind more strongly to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol on Mononuclear Copper(II) Sites Supported on Al2O3: Structure of Active Sites from Electron Paramagnetic Resonance**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16200-16207, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;dispersed CuII sites generated on transition alumina using a molecular approach were employed in the stepwise partial oxidation of methane to methanol. The reactive CuII centers could be identified spectroscopically due to their unique EPR signature. A structure for these unusual CuII monomers, working in pairs, was proposed based on advanced spectroscopic characterization, reactivity studies, and DFT modeling.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to methanol remains one of the holy grails of chemistry, where Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites have been shown promote this reaction under stepwise conditions. Over the years, several active sites have been proposed, ranging from mono&#8208;, di&#8208; to trimeric CuII. Herein, we report the formation of well&#8208;dispersed monomeric CuII species supported on alumina using surface organometallic chemistry and their reactivity towards the selective and stepwise conversion of methane to methanol. Extensive studies using various transition alumina supports combined with spectroscopic characterization, in particular electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), show that the active sites are associated with specific facets, which are typically found in &#947;&#8208; and &#951;&#8208;alumina phase, and that their EPR signature can be attributed to species having a tri&#8208;coordinated [(Al2O)CuIIO(OH)]&#8722; T&#8208;shape geometry. Overall, the selective conversion of methane to methanol, a two&#8208;electron process, involves two monomeric CuII sites that play in concert.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Azide&#8211;Thioalkyne Cycloaddition Catalyzed by Photoactivatable Ruthenium(II) Complexes</title>

Tailored cationic RuII complexes are highly effective precatalysts for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (see scheme). These reactions can now be carried out under very dilute conditions and in complex biorelevant media; they are also compatible with and mutually orthogonal to CuAAC. Moreover, ruthenium&#8211;arene sandwich complexes function as photoactivatable precatalysts, providing for temporal control of the reactivity.







Abstract
Tailored ruthenium sandwich complexes bearing photoresponsive arene ligands can efficiently promote azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (RuAtAC) when irradiated with UV light. The reactions can be performed in a bioorthogonal manner in aqueous mixtures containing biological components. The strategy can also be applied for the selective modification of biopolymers, such as DNA or peptides. Importantly, this ruthenium&#8208;based technology and the standard copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) proved to be compatible and mutually orthogonal.

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15963-15971, July 12, 2021. </description>

The bioinspired, divergent total syntheses of trichodermone and trichoderone A were accomplished from a common biogenetic precursor, aspochalasin Z. Key steps include transannular alkene cyclizations, a singlet oxygen ene reaction, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade reactions. This approach validates the proposed biosynthetic pathway from a chemical perspective and paves the way for the synthesis and characterization of other cytochalasans.







Abstract
We accomplished the divergent total syntheses of ten pentacyclic cytochalasans (aspergillin PZ, trichodermone, trichoderones, flavipesines, and flavichalasines) from a common precursor aspochalasin&#8197;D and revised the structures of trichoderone&#8197;B, spicochalasin&#8197;A, flavichalasine&#8197;C, aspergilluchalasin based on structure network analysis of the cytochalasans biosynthetic pathways and DFT calculations. The key steps of the syntheses include transannular alkene/epoxyalkene and carbonyl&#8208;ene cyclizations to establish the C/D ring of pentacyclic aspochalasans. Our bioinspired approach to these pentacyclic cytochalasans validate the proposed biosynthetic speculation from a chemical view and provide a platform for the synthesis of more than 400 valuable cytochalasans bearing different macrocycles and amino&#8208;acid residues.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Nonaflate: A Practical Trifluoromethoxylating Reagent and its Application to the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Trifluoromethoxylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16171-16177, July 12, 2021. </description>

Trifluoromethyl nonaflate (TFNf), an odorless liquid (bp 87&#8211;89&#8201;&#176;C), was developed as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, and reactive trifluoromethoxylating reagent that can be easily and safely prepared in large scale. The synthetic potency of TFNf was demonstrated with the synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective direct hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of various alkyne derivatives.







Abstract
The trifluoromethoxy group has elicited much interest among drug and agrochemical discovery teams because of its unique properties. We developed trifluoromethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate (nonaflate), TFNf, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, reactive, and scalable trifluoromethoxylating reagent. TFNf is easily and safely prepared in a simple process in large scale and the nonaflyl part of TFNf can easily be recovered as nonaflyl fluoride after usage and recycled. The synthetic potency of TFNf was showcased with the underexplored synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a high regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of alkyne derivatives such as haloalkynes, alkynyl esters, and alkynyl sulfones. The synthetic merits of TFNf were further underscored with a high&#8208;yielding and smooth nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation of alkyl triflates/bromides and primary/secondary alcohols.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Based on a Phase&#8208;Stabilized &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16164-16170, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and efficient CsPbI3 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are demonstrated by resurfacing perovskite with the aid of inorganic ligands (KI). The resurfaced perovskites show a 7&#215; higher phase stability and higher thermal conductivity than in films with organic ligands. The PLEDs exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;% and a 100&#8208;fold improvement in the operating stability compared to previous EQE devices.







Abstract
The all&#8208;inorganic nature of CsPbI3 perovskites allows to enhance stability in perovskite devices. Research efforts have led to improved stability of the black phase in CsPbI3 films; however, these strategies&#8212;including strain and doping&#8212;are based on organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;capped perovskites, which prevent perovskites from forming the close&#8208;packed quantum dot (QD) solids necessary to achieve high charge and thermal transport. We developed an inorganic ligand exchange that leads to CsPbI3 QD films with superior phase stability and increased thermal transport. The atomic&#8208;ligand&#8208;exchanged QD films, once mechanically coupled, exhibit improved phase stability, and we link this to distributing strain across the film. Operando measurements of the temperature of the LEDs indicate that KI&#8208;exchanged QD films exhibit increased thermal transport compared to controls that rely on organic ligands. The LEDs exhibit a maximum EQE of 23&#8201;% with an electroluminescence emission centered at 640&#8197;nm (FWHM: &#8776;31&#8197;nm). These red LEDs provide an operating half&#8208;lifetime of 10&#8197;h (luminance of 200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and an operating stability that is 6&#215; higher than that of control devices.

         <title>Amplified Interfacial Effect in an Atomically Dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16093-16100, July 12, 2021. </description>

An atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd ultrathin 2D inverse nanocatalyst with amplified oxide/metal interface effects may serve as an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed oxide&#8208;on&#8208;metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8211;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets, by in situ creating atomically dispersed RuOx/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The product displays unexpected performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium, which represents 8.0&#8208; and 22.4&#8208;fold enhancement in mass activity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuOx/Pd interface can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd host and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O2 to facilitate the O&#8722;O bond cleavage.

     alt="Amplified Interfacial Effect in an Atomically Dispersed RuOx-on-Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalyst for High-Performance Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An atomically dispersed RuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-on-Pd ultrathin 2D inverse nanocatalyst with amplified oxide/metal interface effects may serve as an excellent Pt-alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed oxide-on-metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8211;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, RuO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-on-Pd nanosheets, by in situ creating atomically dispersed RuO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one-pot synthesis. The product displays unexpected performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium, which represents 8.0- and 22.4-fold enhancement in mass activity compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt-alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Pd interface can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd host and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to facilitate the O&#8722;O bond cleavage. Meanwhile, the d-band center of Pd nanosubstrates is effectively downshifted, realizing weakened oxygen binding strength.&lt;/p&gt;

We demonstrated that the delicate mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint was precisely mimicked to construct a mechanically interlocked network (MIN), which simultaneously integrates incompatible mechanical adaptivity, robustness, and dynamic stability in a single system.







Abstract
Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joints have been widely used for thousands of years in wooden architectures in virtue of their artistic and functional performance. However, imitation of similar structural and mechanical design philosophy to construct mechanically adaptive materials at the molecular level is a challenge. Herein, we report a mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint inspired mechanically interlocked network (MIN), in which the [2]rotaxane crosslink not only mimics the joint in structure, but also reproduces its function in modifying mechanical properties of the MIN. Benefiting from the hierarchical energy dissipative ability along with the controllable intramolecular movement of the mechanically interlocked crosslink, the resultant MIN simultaneously exhibits notable mechanical adaptivity and structural stability in a single system, as manifested by decent stiffness, strength, toughness, and deformation recovery capacity.

         <title>A Family of Nonribosomal Peptides Modulate Collective Behavior in Pseudovibrio Bacteria Isolated from Marine Sponges**

Pseudovibrio are &#945;&#8208;proteobacteria proposed to contribute to marine sponge health. Lack of reverse genetics have hindered exploration of the ecological and biotechnological potential of Pseudovibrio. Here we describe reverse genetics methods that enabled identification of 12 pseudovibriamides, which we show affect motility and biofilm behavior of Pseudovibrio.







Abstract
Although swarming motility and biofilms are opposed collective behaviors, both contribute to bacterial survival and host colonization. Pseudovibrio bacteria have attracted attention because they are part of the microbiome of healthy marine sponges. Two&#8208;thirds of Pseudovibrio genomes contain a member of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase gene cluster family, which is also found sporadically in Pseudomonas pathogens of insects and plants. After developing reverse genetics for Pseudovibrio, we isolated heptapeptides with an ureido linkage and related nonadepsipeptides we termed pseudovibriamides&#8197;A and B, respectively. A combination of genetics and imaging mass spectrometry experiments showed heptapetides were excreted, promoting motility and reducing biofilm formation. In contrast to lipopeptides widely known to affect motility/biofilms, pseudovibriamides are not surfactants. Our results expand current knowledge on metabolites mediating bacterial collective behavior.

         <title>Exceptional Electrochemical HER Performance with Enhanced Electron Transfer between Ru Nanoparticles and Single Atoms Dispersed on a Carbon Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16044-16050, July 12, 2021. </description>

Carbon&#8208;based substrates with an inert surface provide weak metal&#8211;support interactions that are insufficient to effectively modulate the electronic structures of the loaded metal nanoparticles. Here we show that atomic metal species on the carbon substrate can remotely communicate with the supported metal nanoparticles, inducing synergistic electronic coupling with the nanoparticles and enabling the control of their electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Precisely regulating the electronic structures of metal active species is highly desirable for electrocatalysis. However, carbon with inert surface provide weak metal&#8211;support interaction, which is insufficient to modulate the electronic structures of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we propose a new method to control the electrocatalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles by dispersing single metal atoms on an O&#8208;doped graphene. Ideal atomic metal species are firstly computationally screened. We then verify this concept by deposition of Ru nanoparticles onto an O&#8208;doped graphene decorated with single metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consistent with theoretical predictions, such hybrid catalysts show outstanding HER performance, much superior to other reported electrocatalysts such as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. This work offers a new strategy for modulating the activity and stability of metal nanoparticles for electrocatalysis processes.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral S&#8208;nitrosation Mediated by a Dicopper Center</title>

A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.







Abstract
A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO. and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)2]2+ or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)]2+, which readily release RSNO in 88&#8211;94&#8201;% yield. The S&#8208;nitrosation proceeds by a mixed&#8208;valence [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic &#956;&#8208;O site and nitrosates RS&#8722; at the &#956;&#8208;NO site. The [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ complex is also competent for O&#8208;nitrosation of MeOH. A rare [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(OMe)]2+ intermediate was isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the S&#8208;nitrosation may proceed through the intermediary of analogous [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(SR)]2+ species. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Bulk Morphology in Efficient Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15988-15994, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of photoactive materials, the morphology of donor:acceptor (D:A) photovoltaic films can be effectively adjusted. A large D:A ESP difference is required to assist charge generation, but too large ESP difference may result in additional nonradiative recombination loss and lead to hypermiscibility issues.







Abstract
Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a key role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thus determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. Herein, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. We show that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. Enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Fine&#8208;tuning the bulk morphology can give balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Versatile Double&#8208;Allylation Reagent for Complex Diol Synthesis</title>

Make it a double: A strategy for the synthesis of novel double&#8208;allylation reagents based on the alkenylboration of alkenylboronates is presented. The ease and modularity with which the reagents can be prepared allows rapid access to a variety of complex diol motifs. In the context of these studies, we also demonstrate the first examples of the use of boronamides in allylation reactions.







Abstract
Double&#8208;allylation reagents allow for the construction of highly complex molecules in an expedient fashion. We have developed an efficient, modular, and enantioselective approach towards accessing novel variants of these reagents through Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkenylboration of alkenylboron derivatives. Importantly, we demonstrate novel use of an allylBdan reagent directly in a stereocontrolled allylation without initial deprotection to the boronic ester. These allylation products are employed in a second intermolecular allylation to access complex diol motifs, which has yet to be shown with these types of double&#8208;allylation reagents. Overall, the modularity of this approach and the ease in which complex structural motifs can be accessed in a rapid manner signify the importance and utility of this method.

         <title>Enhancing Thermocatalytic Activities by Upshifting the d&#8208;Band Center of Exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe Ternary Alloy Nanoparticles for the Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15912-15919, July 12, 2021. </description>

Ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe nanoparticles were produced by topotactic exsolution. Compared bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, the ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the dry reforming of methane. DFT calculations indicated the enhanced activity originates from the optimal upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a feasible solution to address the reduction of greenhouse gases stipulated by the Paris Climate Agreement, given that it adds value by converting trivial gases, CO2 and CH4, simultaneously into useful syngas. However, the conventional Ni catalyst undergoes deactivation due to carbon coking and particle agglomeration. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient and durable DRM catalyst: exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe ternary alloy nanoparticles on the layered perovskite PrBaMn1.7Co0.1Ni0.2O5+&#948; produced by topotactic exsolution. This method readily allows the generation of a larger number of exsolved nanoparticles with enhanced catalytic activity above that of Ni monometallic and Co&#8208;Ni bimetallic particles. The enhancement is achieved by the upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe relative to those of Co&#8208;Ni and Ni, meaning easier charge donation to the adsorbate. Furthermore, the exsolved catalyst shows exceptional stability, with continuous DRM operation for about 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Exploiting Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Conditions to Trigger Pathway Complexity in the Growth of a MOF</title>

We show that human&#8208;made self&#8208;assembled materials, such as porous coordination polymers, can follow distinct growth pathways in a given energy landscape in response to a controlled diffusion of reagents.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), are crystalline materials with promising applications in electronics, magnetism, catalysis, and gas storage/separation. However, the mechanisms and pathways underlying their formation remain largely undisclosed. Herein, we demonstrate that diffusion&#8208;controlled mixing of reagents at the very early stages of the crystallization process (i.e., within &#8776;40&#8197;ms), achieved by using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices, can be used to enable novel crystallization pathways of a prototypical spin&#8208;crossover MOF towards its thermodynamic product. In particular, two distinct and unprecedented nucleation&#8208;growth pathways were experimentally observed when crystallization was triggered under microfluidic mixing. Full&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations also confirm the occurrence of these two distinct pathways during crystal growth. In sharp contrast, a crystallization by particle attachment was observed under bulk (turbulent) mixing. These unprecedented results provide a sound basis for understanding the growth of CPs and open up new avenues for the engineering of porous materials by using out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>A Synthetic Galectin Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16178-16183, July 12, 2021. </description>

A synthetic galectin mimic was designed, synthesized, and shown to bind selectively to n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
Galectins are a galactoside specific subclass of carbohydrate binding proteins (lectins) involved in various cellular activities, certain cancers, infections, inflammations, and many other biological processes. The molecular basis for the selectivity of galectins is well&#8208;documented and revolves around appropriate interaction complementarity: an aromatic residue for C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and polar residues for (charge assisted) hydrogen bonds with the axial hydroxyl group of a galactoside. However, no synthetic mimics are currently available. We now report on the design and synthesis of the first galectin mimic (6), and show that it has a higher than 65&#8208;fold preference for n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galactoside (8) over n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside (7) in CD2Cl2 containing 5&#8201;% [D6]DMSO (with Ka&#8805;4500&#8197;M&#8722;1 for 6:8). Molecular modeling informed by nOe studies reveal a high degree of interaction complementarity between 6 and galactoside 8, which is very similar to the interaction complementarity found in natural galectins.

We now report on the design and synthesis of the first galectin mimic (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), and show that it has a higher than 65-fold preference for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-octyl-&#946;-galactoside (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) over &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-octyl-&#946;-glucoside (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) in CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; containing 5&#8201;% [D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]DMSO (with &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8805;4500&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;). Molecular modeling informed by nOe studies reveal a high degree of interaction complementarity between &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and galactoside &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;, which is very similar to the interaction complementarity found in natural galectins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16129-16138, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motorized macrocycles have been successfully synthesized by combining molecular motors with crown ether macrocycles, enabling unique photo&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems controlled by the multi&#8208;stable unidirectional rotation of molecular motors. The switchable chiral cavity can be also used for the enantioselective recognition of guests.







Abstract
Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. We designed photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. The octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8211;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems and dynamic materials.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15886-15890, July 12, 2021. </description>

A simple dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was discovered to boost the rechargeable persistent luminescence performance of the persistent luminescence nanoparticles. The dye sensitized nanoparticles are used for PersL imaging guided tumorectomy. They provide simultaneous enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background afterglow intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and simple microscopic fluorescent cellular imaging.







Abstract
Owing to their unique afterglow ability, long&#8208;wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (PersL) nanoparticles (PLNPs) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes. Long&#8208;wavelength LED light has been shown to be effective in recharging these nanoparticles. However, finding a simple and effective method to amplify such renewable PersL signals under long&#8208;wavelength light is still a key challenge. Herein, we discovered that a dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was able to effectively boost the renewable PersL signals of the NIR emitting ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGC)) under long&#8208;wavelength LED light. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle tumorectomy demonstration, this new class of dye sensitized ZGC enabled simultaneous intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and effective microscopic detection of tumor cells in pathological diagnosis.

         <title>Stable Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Copper(II/I) Redox Mediators Bearing a Pentadentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16156-16163, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, copper complexes bearing pentadentate ligands, namely [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ and [Cu(tme)]2+/+, have been reported as redox mediators in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Strikingly, devices based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices employing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart.







Abstract
In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, experiments revealed that ubiquitously used Lewis&#8208;base additives in the electrolytes coordinate to the CuII species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability. We report the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine&#8208;tripyridine pentadentate ligands, [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ (tpe=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]2+/+ (tme=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Experimental measurements demonstrate that the coordination environment of Cu(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart. DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 400&#8197;h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80&#8201;%) under identical conditions.

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15899-15904, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid aptamers were developed that are capable of covalently labeling their protein target with a functional molecule. Additionally, with little modification, the aptamer covalently crosslinked to its target instead, thereby inhibiting its function. Covalent aptamers offer a new tool for selective protein modification, detection, and inhibition.







Abstract
We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleotide sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.

         <title>Altering Hydrogenation Pathways in Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation by Tuning Local Electronic Structure of Oxygen Vacancy with Dopant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16085-16092, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the local electronic structure of nearby oxygen vacancy by doping enables the control of N2 hydrogenation from the associative alternating pathway to a more favorable associative distal pathway, thus contributing to improved performance for NH3 evolution in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
To avoid the energy&#8208;consuming step of direct N&#8801;N bond cleavage, photocatalytic N2 fixation undergoing the associative pathways has been developed for mild&#8208;condition operation. However, it is a fundamental yet challenging task to gain comprehensive understanding on how the associative pathways (i.e., alternating vs. distal) are influenced and altered by the fine structure of catalysts, which eventually holds the key to significantly promote the practical implementation. Herein, we introduce Fe dopants into TiO2 nanofibers to stabilize oxygen vacancies and simultaneously tune their local electronic structure. The combination of in&#8197;situ characterizations with first&#8208;principles simulations reveals that the modulation of local electronic structure by Fe dopants turns the hydrogenation of N2 from associative alternating pathway to associative distal pathway. This work provides fresh hints for rationally controlling the reaction pathways toward efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Rational Design of Crystallization&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Probes To Detect Amorphous Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>

Aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission dyes were rationally designed to detect amorphous protein aggregation with controllable sensitivity, color, and cellular performance (see structure). A dimethylaminophenylene group enabled selective binding and fluorescence enhancement, and the emission wavelength could be tuned by altering the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the other ring while retaining selective detection.







Abstract
Unlike amyloid aggregates, amorphous protein aggregates with no defined structures have been challenging to target and detect in a complex cellular milieu. In this study, we rationally designed sensors of amorphous protein aggregation from aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission probes (AIEgens). Utilizing dicyanoisophorone as a model AIEgen scaffold, we first sensitized the fluorescence of AIEgens to a nonpolar and viscous environment mimicking the interior of amorphous aggregated proteins. We identified a generally applicable moiety (dimethylaminophenylene) for selective binding and fluorescence enhancement. Regulation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups tuned the emission wavelength while retaining selective detection. Finally, we utilized the optimized probe to systematically image aggregated proteome upon proteostasis network regulation. Overall, we present a rational approach to develop amorphous protein aggregation sensors from AIEgens with controllable sensitivity, spectral coverage, and cellular performance.

         <title>Rotaxane CoII Complexes as Field&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Ion Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16051-16058, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked ligands enable predictable metal ion coordination, offering a new strategy to engineer their properties. A series of field&#8208;induced CoII single&#8208;ion magnets illustrates this principle. The predictable coordination behaviour of the rotaxane enables remarkably accurate calculation of their zero&#8208;field splittings, which are in agreement with experimental observations, and can be rationalized in terms of metal&#8211;ligand bonding.







Abstract
Mechanically chelating ligands have untapped potential for the engineering of metal ion properties. Here we demonstrate this principle in the context of CoII&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets. Using multi&#8208;frequency EPR, susceptibility and magnetization measurements we found that these complexes show some of the highest zero field splittings reported for five&#8208;coordinate CoII complexes to date. The predictable coordination behaviour of the interlocked ligands allowed the magnetic properties of their CoII complexes to be evaluated computationally a priori and our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to rationalize the observed trends. The predictable magnetic behaviour of the rotaxane CoII complexes demonstrates that interlocked ligands offer a new strategy to design metal complexes with interesting functionality.

         <title>Genetic Encoding and Enzymatic Deprotection of a Latent Thiol Side Chain to Enable New Protein Bioconjugation Applications</title>

Enzymatic deprotection of a latent thiol under mild and physiological conditions expands the scope of classic thiol bioconjugation. New reaction schemes enable regioselective labeling and dual modifications for a variety of preparative applications and using the established and commercially available plethora of thiol&#8208;directed reagents.







Abstract
The thiol group of the cysteine side chain is arguably the most versatile chemical handle in proteins. To expand the scope of established and commercially available thiol bioconjugation reagents, we genetically encoded a second such functional moiety in form of a latent thiol group that can be unmasked under mild physiological conditions. Phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) protected homocysteine (HcP) was incorporated and its latent thiol group unmasked on purified proteins using penicillin G acylase (PGA). The enzymatic deprotection depends on steric accessibility, but can occur efficiently within minutes on exposed positions in flexible sequences. The freshly liberated thiol group does not require treatment with reducing agents. We demonstrate the potential of this approach for protein modification with conceptually new schemes for regioselective dual labeling, thiol bioconjugation in presence of a preserved disulfide bond and formation of a novel intramolecular thioether crosslink.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Nano&#8208;Ferroelectrics for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

Heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is induced by engineering the surface reconstruction, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb piezocatalytic overall water&#8208;splitting activity.







Abstract
Developing nano&#8208;ferroelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric performance for piezocatalysts used in water splitting is highly desired but also challenging, especially with respect to reaching large piezo&#8208;potentials that fully align with required redox levels. Herein, heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is successfully induced by engineering their surface reconstruction to dramatically enhance their piezoelectricity. The strain coherence can be maintained throughout the nanoparticle bulk, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized blue&#8208;colored BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb overall water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rates of 159&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is almost 130 times higher than that of the pristine BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Thus, this work provides a generic approach for designing highly efficient piezoelectric nanomaterials by strain engineering that can be further extended to various other perovskite oxides, including SrTiO3, thereby enhancing their potential for piezoelectric catalysis.

         <title>The Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>

Hole&#8208;tunneling heterojunctions of atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes were designed rationally to achieve an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% in the all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven APS cells equipped with a Ni&#8208;SNG catalyst cathode for CO2 conversion into syngas with excellent stability for 30&#8197;h under 450&#8197;nm LED irradation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on Sn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 nanorods (SF NRs) were designed by combining atomic deposition of an Al2O3 overlayer with chemical grafting of a RuOx hole&#8208;collector for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion. The RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;SF photoanode with a 3.0&#8197;nm thick Al2O3 overlayer gave a &gt;5&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced IPCE value of 52.0&#8201;% under 370&#8197;nm light irradiation at 1.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, compared to the bare SF NRs. The dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al2O3/SF NRs interface. Accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber aids fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to single&#8208;atom RuOx species, accelerating the O2&#8208;evolving reaction kinetics. The maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO2&#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode; an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% was recorded under 450&#8197;nm light irradiation.

         <title>Segmented Flow Processes to Overcome Hurdles of Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalysis in the Presence of Organic Solvents</title>

Utilizing tools of segmented flow chemistry enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for different biotransformations with an imine reductase, aldoxime dehydratase, allene oxide synthase and cyclase, the power of flow processes is demonstrated, leading to a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion as well as a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up and a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield compared to the analogous batch processes.







Abstract
In modern process development, it is imperative to consider biocatalysis, and whole&#8208;cell catalysts often represent a favored form of such catalysts. However, the application of whole&#8208;cell catalysis in typical organic batch two&#8208;phase synthesis often struggles due to mass transfer limitations, emulsion formation, tedious work&#8208;up and, thus, low yields. Herein, we demonstrate that utilizing segmented flow tools enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for three different biotransformations, the power of such segmented flow processes is shown. For example, a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion from 34&#8201;% to &gt;99&#8201;% and a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up leading to a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield from 44&#8201;% to 65&#8201;% compared to the analogous batch process was achieved in such a flow process.

         <title>Benchmark C2H2/CO2 Separation in an Ultra&#8208;Microporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Copper(I)&#8208;Alkynyl Chemistry</title>

Herein, we report the first example of using copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry in porous MOFs to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation, wherein the incorporated CuI sites provide the specifically ultra&#8208;strong binding affinity for C2H2 to afford the record&#8208;high C2H2/CO2 selectivity at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Separation of acetylene from carbon dioxide remains a daunting challenge because of their very similar molecular sizes and physical properties. We herein report the first example of using copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry within an ultra&#8208;microporous MOF (CuI@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)2) to achieve ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. The anchored CuI ions on the pore surfaces can specifically and strongly interact with C2H2 molecule through copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl &#960;&#8208;complexation and thus rapidly adsorb large amount of C2H2 at low&#8208;pressure region, while effectively reduce CO2 uptake due to the small pore sizes. This material thus exhibits the record high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 185 at ambient conditions, significantly higher than the previous benchmark ZJU&#8208;74a (36.5) and ATC&#8208;Cu (53.6). Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique &#960;&#8208;complexation between CuI and C2H2 mainly contributes to the ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 binding affinity and record selectivity. The exceptional separation performance was evidenced by breakthrough experiments for C2H2/CO2 gas mixtures. This work suggests a new perspective to functionalizing MOFs with copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry for highly selective separation of C2H2 over CO2.

Metal active sites speciation on Pt&#8208;CHA is discussed for different high&#8208;temperature oxidation reactions, including 16O2/18O2 isotopic exchange experiments, methane combustion, and CO oxidation. Structure&#8211;performance relationships built on subtle changes in the active sites under working conditions are revealed.







Abstract
The behavior of single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters was investigated for high&#8208;temperature oxidations. The high stability of these molecular sites in CHA is a key to intrinsic structure&#8211;performance descriptions of elemental steps such as O2 dissociation, and subsequent oxidation catalysis. Subtle changes in the atomic structure of Pt are responsible for drastic changes in performance driven by specific gas/metal/support interactions. Whereas single Pt atoms and Pt clusters (&gt; ca. 1&#8197;nm) are unable to activate, scramble, and desorb two O2 molecules at moderate T (200&#8201;&#176;C), clusters &lt;1&#8197;nm do so catalytically, but undergo oxidative fragmentation. Oxidation of alkanes at high T is attributed to stable single Pt atoms, and the C&#8208;H cleavage is inferred to be rate&#8208;determining and less sensitive to changes in metal nuclearity compared to its effect on O2 scrambling. In contrast, when combustion involves CO, catalysis is dominated by metal clusters, not single Pt atoms.

Current approved FGFR inhibitors lack selectivity within the FGFR family, which may contribute to their poor tolerability. Here, we describe DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a selective FGFR1&amp;2 degrader that destabilized wildtype FGFR1&amp;2 and FGFR2 fusion proteins, had potent anti&#8208;proliferative activity in FGFR2&#8208;dependent cells, and possessed pharmacokinetics properties suitable for in vivo degradation. Thus, FGFR degradation may be a promising therapeutic approach.







Abstract
Aberrant activation of FGFR signaling occurs in many cancers, and ATP&#8208;competitive FGFR inhibitors have received regulatory approval. Despite demonstrating clinical efficacy, these inhibitors exhibit dose&#8208;limiting toxicity, potentially due to a lack of selectivity amongst the FGFR family and are poorly tolerated. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a bivalent degrader that couples the pan&#8208;FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 to a CRL2VHL E3 ligase recruiting ligand, which preferentially induces FGFR1&amp;2 degradation while largely sparing FGFR3&amp;4. DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 exhibited two&#8208;digit nanomolar DC50s for both wildtype FGFR2 and several FGFR2&#8208;fusions, resulting in degradation&#8208;dependent antiproliferative activity in representative gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 induced degradation of a clinically relevant FGFR2 fusion protein in a xenograft model. Taken together, we demonstrate that DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 has potential as a prototype FGFR degrader.

         <title>Regulating Twisted Skeleton to Construct Organ&#8208;Specific Perylene for Intensive Cancer Chemotherapy</title>

Herein we modulate the perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of a twisted perylene PDIC&#8208;NC. The in vitro and in vivo biological functions of PDIC&#8208;NC are demonstrated and its molecular mechanism for the inhibiting activity on tumour cells is revealed.







Abstract
The systemic use of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer patients is a compromise between desirable therapy and side effects because of the intrinsic shortage of organ&#8208;specific pharmaceutical drug. Design and construction of pharmaceutical drug to achieve the organ&#8208;specific delivery is thus desperately desirable. We herein regulate perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of bay&#8208;twisted PDIC&#8208;NC. We further demonstrate that PDIC&#8208;NC can target into mitochondria to act as cellular respiration inhibitor, inducing insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate, promoting endogenous H2O2 and .OH burst, elevating calcium overload, efficiently triggering the synergistic apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress of lung cancer cells. The antitumor performance of PDIC&#8208;NC is verified on in vivo xenografted, metastasis and orthotopic lung cancer, presenting overwhelming evidences for potentially clinical application. This study contributes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of twisted perylene to well attain lung&#8208;specific distribution, and meanwhile achieves intensive lung cancer chemotherapy.

         <title>Plastic Waste Conversion over a Refinery Waste Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16101-16108, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the path to finding better catalysts for polyolefin plastic waste conversion to aromatics, we have found that a waste refinery catalyst performed better than the fresh catalyst with decreased accumulation of deactivating carbonaceous deposits. Fluorescence microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the interaction of the polymer with the catalyst and to map the location and type of bulky aromatic species.







Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) makes up a large share of our plastic waste. We investigated the conversion of PP over the industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking catalyst (FCC&#8208;cat) used to produce gasoline from crude oil fractions. We studied transport limitations arising from the larger size of polymers compared to the crude oil&#8208;based feedstock by testing the components of this catalyst separately. Infrared spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the role of the FCC matrix in aromatization, and the zeolite Y domains in coking. An equilibrium catalyst (ECAT), discarded during FCC operation as waste, produced the same aromatics content as a fresh FCC&#8208;cat, while coking decreased significantly, likely due to the reduced accessibility and activity of the zeolite domains and an enhanced cracking activity of the matrix due to metal deposits present in ECAT. This mechanistic understanding provides handles for further improving the catalyst composition towards higher aromatics selectivity.

         <title>Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Surface Titanium Activates Dephosphorylation Over TiO2 Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16149-16155, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate for the first time that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation near room temperature. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine imposed on the TiO2(001) surface strongly manipulates the electronic state of surrounding Ti5C atoms by making them very acidic, facilitating not only the bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP but also its subsequent activation.







Abstract
Dephosphorylation that removes a phosphate group from substrates is an important reaction for living organisms and environmental protection. Although CeO2 has been shown to catalyze this reaction, cerium is low in natural abundance and has a narrow global distribution (&gt;90&#8201;% of these reserves are located within six countries). It is thus imperative to find another element/material with high worldwide abundance that can also efficiently extract the phosphate out of agricultural waste for phosphorus recycle. Using para&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (p&#8208;NPP) as a model compound, we demonstrate that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation at temperatures as low as 40&#8201;&#176;C. By probe&#8208;assisted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine makes Ti atoms (the active sites) on the (001) surface very acidic. The bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP on this surface further promotes its subsequent activation with a barrier &#8776;20&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower than that of the pristine (001) and (101) surfaces, allowing the activation of this reaction near room temperature (from &gt;80&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>A Distannylated Monomer of a Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16184-16190, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is readily synthesized and used to develop acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels and can be effectively n&#8208;doped, and thus lead to excellent thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
Acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8722;4.4&#8197;eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 24.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.

     alt="A Distannylated Monomer of a Strong Electron-Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor-Type Conjugated Polymers for n-Type Thermoelectric Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distannylated monomer of strong electron-deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is readily synthesized and used to develop acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A-A) type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels and can be effectively n-doped, and thus lead to excellent thermoelectric performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A-A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high-performance n-type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A-A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron-deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A-A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8722;4.4&#8197;eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n-doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and power factor of 24.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This performance is among the best for n-type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A-A type organoboron polymers for high-performance n-type thermoelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tricyanidoferrates(&#8722;IV) and Ruthenates(&#8722;IV) with Non&#8208;Innocent Cyanido Ligands</title>

The electron&#8208;rich cyanidometalates [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; represent the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with an oxidation state of &#8722;IV. DFT calculations reveal a nominal d10s0 configuration, which corresponds to an effective charge of 2&#8722;. The high negative charge also weakens the C&#8722;N bonds by the population of antibonding states.







Abstract
Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and AE3.5[M(CN)3] (AE=Sr, Ba; M=Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8722;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in P63/m, the polar space group P63 with three&#8208;fold cell volume for AE3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation. X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy reveal longer C&#8722;N distances (124&#8211;128&#8197;pm) and much lower stretching frequencies (1484&#8211;1634&#8197;cm&#8722;1) than in classical cyanidometalates. Weak C&#8722;N bonds in combination with strong M&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonding is a scheme also known for carbonylmetalates. Instead of the formal notation [Fe&#8722;IV(CN&#8722;)3]7&#8722;, quantum chemical calculations reveal non&#8208;innocent intermediate&#8208;valent CN1.67&#8722; ligands and a closed&#8208;shell d10 configuration for Fe, that is, Fe2&#8722;.

         <title>Limonin as a Starting Point for the Construction of Compounds with High Scaffold Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16119-16128, July 12, 2021. </description>

Many compound collections used in high&#8208;throughput screening are composed of members whose structural complexity is considerably lower than that of natural products. Here the natural product limonin was leveraged to generate 98 architecturally complex compounds with significant scaffold diversity. Phenotypic screening of the collection led to the discovery of novel anticancer compounds.







Abstract
Structurally complex natural products have been a fruitful source for the discovery and development of new drugs. In an effort to construct a compound collection populated by architecturally complex members with unique scaffolds, we have used the natural product limonin as a starting point. Limonin is an abundant triterpenoid natural product and, through alteration of its heptacyclic core ring system using short synthetic sequences, a collection of 98 compounds was created, including multiple members with novel ring systems. The reactions leveraged in the construction of these compounds include novel ring cleavage, rearrangements, and cyclizations, and this work is highlighted by the discovery of a novel B&#8208;ring cleavage reaction, a unique B/C&#8208;ring rearrangement, an atypical D&#8208;ring cyclization, among others. Computational analysis shows that 52 different scaffolds/ring systems were produced during the course of this work, of which 36 are unprecedented. Phenotypic screening and structure&#8211;activity relationships identified compounds with activity against a panel of cancer cell lines.

The first electrochemical activation of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes has been applied for the formal insertion of molecular oxygen into these compounds. C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage of the ring moieties was achieved either by direct anodic electrolysis or by utilizing a DDQ&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and supportive experiments provided mechanistic understanding of the electrocatalytic process.







Abstract
We describe the first electrochemical activation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes leading after C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage to the formation of highly reactive radical cations. This concept is utilized to formally insert molecular oxygen after direct or DDQ&#8208;assisted anodic oxidation of the strained carbocycles, delivering &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and 1,2&#8208;dioxanes electrocatalytically. Furthermore, insights into the mechanism of the oxidative process, obtained experimentally and by additional quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are presented. The synthetic potential of the reaction products is demonstrated by diverse derivatizations.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Based Hydrogen Sulfide Nanomotors Induce Multiple Acidosis in Tumor Cells by Destroying Tumor Metabolic Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16139-16148, July 12, 2021. </description>

Using the chemical reaction in a tumor environment, L&#8208;cysteine can be catalyzed by cystathionine &#946;&#8208;synthase in the tumor microenvironment to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and L&#8208;serine, to construct a H2S&#8208;driven nanomotor. The nanomotors can move in the tumor microenvironment, destroy tumor metabolic symbiosis and inhibit tumor growth specifically.







Abstract
Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H2S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.

Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Lived Triplet Excited State in Water at Room Temperature: Insights on the Molecular Design of Tridecafullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16109-16118, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented ultra&#8208;long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (93&#8197;ms in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been measured for a globular glycodendrimeric tridecafullerene. The photophysics of S1 and T1, T1 quenching by O2 and N3&#8722;, and molecular modelling provide unequivocal evidence of the role played by the molecular design of the spacers connecting the core&#8211;shell C60 units and the C60&#8208;sugars on the degree of water solvation and its effect on this remarkable finding.







Abstract
Suitably engineered molecular systems exhibiting triplet excited states with very long lifetimes are important for high&#8208;end applications in nonlinear optics, photocatalysis, or biomedicine. We report the finding of an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;lived triplet state with a mean lifetime of 93&#8197;ms in an aqueous phase at room temperature, measured for a globular tridecafullerene with a highly compact glycodendrimeric structure. A series of three tridecafullerenes bearing different glycodendrons and spacers to the C60 units have been synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra and DLS experiments confirm their aggregation in water. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence experiments suggest a different degree of inner solvation of the multifullerenes depending on their molecular design. Efficient quenching of the triplet states by O2 but not by waterborne azide anions has been observed. Molecular modelling reveals dissimilar access of the aqueous phase to the internal structure of the tridecafullerenes, differently shielded by the glycodendrimeric shell.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Fabrication and Atomic&#8208;Scale Characterization of Triply Linked, Laterally &#960;&#8208;Extended Porphyrin Nanotapes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16208-16214, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first on&#8208;surface preparation of porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) on a gold surface. Structural and electronic characterization reveals that the Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. This study provides an alternative and versatile route to the fabrication of Por NTs and a detailed atomic&#8208;scale characterization of their structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) are promising structures for their use as molecular wires thanks to a high degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low HOMO&#8212;LUMO gaps, and exceptional conductance. Such structures have been prepared in solution, but their on&#8208;surface synthesis remains unreported. Here, meso&#8211;meso triply fused Por NTs have been prepared through a two&#8208;step synthesis on Au(111). The diradical character of the on&#8208;surface formed building block PorA2, a phenalenyl &#960;&#8208;extended ZnIIPor, facilitates intermolecular homocoupling and allows for the formation of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended tapes. The structural and electronic properties of individual Por NTs are addressed, both on Au(111) and on a thin insulating NaCl layer, by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy complemented by DFT calculations. These Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. Our study provides a versatile route towards Por NTs and the atomic&#8208;scale characterization of such tapes.

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>

Kinetic and spectroscopic signatures of dimeric and monomeric copper species hosted in mordenite and reacting with methane have been identified.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV/Vis and in situ EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented low&#8208;temperature, asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of sterically hindered secondary amines with aryl chlorides via kinetic resolution is reported. A bulky yet flexible, chiral NHC ligand enables both low barrier oxidative addition and reductive elimination and high levels of enantiocontrol. Computational studies indicate that multiple &#963;&#8208;bond rotations of the C2&#8208;symmetric chiral NHC adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling has revolutionized the construction of amines. Despite the innovations of multiple generations of ligands to modulate the reactivity of the metal center, ligands for the low&#8208;temperature enantioselective amination of aryl halides remain a coveted target of catalyst engineering. Designs that promote one elementary reaction often create bottlenecks at other steps. We here report an unprecedented low&#8208;temperature (as low as &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C), enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides with sterically hindered secondary amines via a kinetic resolution process (s factor up to &gt;300). A bulky yet flexible chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand is leveraged to drive both oxidative addition and reductive elimination with low barriers and control the enantioselectivity. Computational studies indicate that the rotations of multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds on the C2&#8208;symmetric chiral ligand adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes. We expect this design would be widely applicable to diverse transition states to achieve other challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Exploring Structure and Function of Redox Intermediates in [NiFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases by an Advanced Experimental Approach for Solvated, Lyophilized and Crystallized Metalloenzymes</title>

A multifunctional setup for in situ spectroscopy on gas&#8208;processing metalloenzymes enables the controlled preparation of redox states in various sample forms. This setup allowed the first NRVS characterization of the Nia&#8722;C state of [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases, provided new insights into the reductive activation of these enzymes, and revealed a so&#8208;far unknown redox state of the oxygen&#8208;tolerant membrane&#8208;bound hydrogenase from R.&#8197;eutropha.







Abstract
To study metalloenzymes in detail, we developed a new experimental setup allowing the controlled preparation of catalytic intermediates for characterization by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ monitoring of redox transitions by infrared spectroscopy in enzyme lyophilizate, crystals, and solution during gas exchange in a wide temperature range can be accomplished as well. Two O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases were investigated as model systems. First, we utilized our platform to prepare highly concentrated hydrogenase lyophilizate in a paramagnetic state harboring a bridging hydride. This procedure proved beneficial for 57Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy and revealed, in combination with density functional theory calculations, the vibrational fingerprint of this catalytic intermediate. The same in situ IR setup, combined with resonance Raman spectroscopy, provided detailed insights into the redox chemistry of enzyme crystals, underlining the general necessity to complement X&#8208;ray crystallographic data with spectroscopic analyses.

         <title>Introduction of a Luminophore into Generic Polymers via Mechanoradical Coupling with a Prefluorescent Reagent</title>

         <dc:description>
Polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. The method allows the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for introducing a luminophore into generic polymers facilitated by mechanical stimulation. In this study, polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. This method allowed the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene. These results indicate that the present mechanoradical coupling strategy may help to transform existing commodity polymers into more valuable functional materials.

         <title>Folded Perylene Diimide Loops as Mechanoresponsive Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16191-16199, July 12, 2021. </description>

Two perylene diimides are combined to form a loop that acts as a supramolecular mechanophore. Mechanical deformation of polymers featuring this mechanophore triggers an instant, visually discernible, and reversible fluorescence color change that linearly correlates with the applied strain.







Abstract
A supramolecular mechanophore that can be integrated into polymers and indicates deformation by a fluorescence color change is reported. Two perylene diimides (PDIs) were connected by a short spacer and equipped with peripheral atom transfer polymerization initiators. In the idle state, the motif folds into a loop and its emission is excimer dominated. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) chains were grown from the motif and the mechanophore&#8208;containing polymer was blended with unmodified PMA to afford materials that display a visually discernible fluorescence color change upon deformation, which causes the loops to unfold. The response is instant, and correlates linearly with the applied strain. Experiments with a reference polymer containing only one PDI moiety show that looped mechanophores that display intramolecular excimer formation offer considerable advantages over intermolecular dye aggregates, including a concentration&#8208;independent response, direct signaling of mechanical processes, and a more pronounced optical change.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15&#8201;% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15935-15943, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing polymer acceptor PFY&#8208;3Se with a narrow band gap, high electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction was developed. In all&#8208;polymer solar cells, batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch insensitive PFY&#8208;3Se obtained an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15&#8201;% with high reproducibility, which is much better than its analogue, selenophene&#8208;free PFY&#8208;0Se (13.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) progressed tremendously due to recent advances in polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs), and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded 15&#8201;%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still restricted by a lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. A multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, PFY&#8208;3Se, was developed based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer. Compared to its thiophene analogue PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se shows a &#8776;30&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction. In all&#8208;PSCs, PFY&#8208;3Se achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1&#8201;% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs reported to date and much better than PFY&#8208;0Se (PCE=13.0&#8201;%). Notably, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties for realizing reproducible device performance, which is the first reported and also very rare for the PSMAs. Moreover, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs show low dependence of PCE on device area (0.045&#8211;1.0&#8197;cm2) and active layer thickness (110&#8211;250&#8197;nm), indicating the great potential toward practical applications.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroborations with Broad Scope</title>

Mn(hmds)2 enables clean hydroborations of C=X electrophiles (nitriles, amides, esters, pyridines, carbonates, diimides) at 20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C. The protocol was applied to polymer degradations (polyesters, polycarbonates) and CO2 reduction. Mechanistic studies indicate the catalytic role of MnII hydrides, for example, the isolated cluster [MnH(hmds)]6.







Abstract
Reductive transformations of easily available oxidized matter are at the heart of synthetic manipulation and chemical valorization. The applications of catalytic hydrofunctionalization benefit from the use of liquid reducing agents and operationally facile setups. Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroborations provide a highly prolific platform for reductive valorizations of stable C=X electrophiles. Here, we report an especially facile, broad&#8208;scope reduction of various functions including carbonyls, carboxylates, pyridines, carbodiimides, and carbonates under very mild conditions with the inexpensive pre&#8208;catalyst Mn(hmds)2. The reaction could be successfully applied to depolymerizations.

         <title>Isomeric Dibenzoheptazethrenes for Air&#8208;Stable Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16230-16236, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dibenzoheptazethrene isomers with low diradical character, large singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, and narrow energy gaps were synthesized. Both compounds exhibited remarkably high stability, which allowed for the fabrication of single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors in air. A hole mobility of up to 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was obtained with good bias&#8208;stress and storage stability.







Abstract
Singlet diradicaloids hold great potential as semiconductors for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, their relative low material and device stabilities impede the practical applications. Here, to achieve balanced stability and performance, two isomeric dibenzoheptazethrene derivatives with singlet diradical character were synthesized in a concise manner. Benefitting from the aromatic stabilization, both compounds display a small diradical character and large singlet&#8211;triplet gap, as corroborated by variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, single&#8208;crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations. OFET devices based on single crystals showed a high hole mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest for zethrene&#8208;based semiconductors. Both isomers exhibited remarkable material stability in air&#8208;saturated solutions as well as excellent bias&#8208;stress and storage stability in device under ambient air.

Firefly&#8208;like persistent luminescence nanoparticles for accurate imaging guided tumor surgery are reported by Gang Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;15886. Organic dye molecules act as &#8220;wings&#8221; and can be conjugated with persistent luminescence nanoparticles. Such dye&#8208;sensitized nanoparticles emit boosted afterglow signals for a long period of time without the need for additional light input, reminiscent of a firefly.

         <title>Innovative Synthetic Procedures for Luminogens Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15724-15742, July 12, 2021. </description>

Innovative synthetic procedures involving transition metals, acid, or base are being rapidly developed for the facile synthesis of a diverse range of luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens). These emerging synthetic possibilities will enable AIEgens to be used in a wealth of multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
As a consequence of their intrinsic advantageous properties, luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens) have received increasing global interest for a wide range of applications. Whereas general synthetic methods towards AIEgens largely rely on tedious procedures and limited reaction types, various innovative synthetic methods have now emerged as complementary, and even alternative, strategies. In this Review, we systematically highlight advancements made in metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization and metal&#8208;free&#8208;promoted pathways for the construction of AIEgens over the past five years, and briefly illustrate new perspectives in this area. The development of innovative synthetic procedures will enable the facile synthesis of AIEgens with great structural diversity for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Advancing the Logic of Chemical Synthesis: C&#8722;H Activation as Strategic and Tactical Disconnections for C&#8722;C Bond Construction</title>

The advent of new synthetic methods has historically motivated the evolution of retrosynthetic logic. A significant recent advance is C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by C&#8722;H activation, but it has only seen modest application in synthesis. This Review compares traditional synthetic routes towards complex targets with reconceptualized ones utilizing C&#8722;H activation, highlighting the strategic advantages of this powerful approach.







Abstract
The design of synthetic routes by retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners. However, its uptake in total synthesis has been tepid, partially due to their apparent synthetic intractability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for implementation. This Review addresses these issues and offers a guide to identify retrosynthetic opportunities to generate C&#8722;C bonds by C&#8722;H activation processes. By comparing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches and recent C&#8722;H activation methods, this Review demonstrates how C&#8722;H activation enabled C&#8722;C bond construction has led to more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, shortcomings of existing processes are highlighted; this Review illustrates how some highlighted total syntheses can be further economized by adopting next&#8208;generation ligand&#8208;enabled approaches.

         <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidation of Organic Molecules by Multistep Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15686-15704, July 12, 2021. </description>

Recent progress in aerobic oxidations using electron transfer mediators (ETMs) via multistep electron relay is highlighted. The coupled catalytic systems significantly facilitate the transport of the electrons from the reduced substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRC) to O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. This strategy has become powerful and valuable in synthetic organic chemistry.







Abstract
This Minireview presents recent important homogenous aerobic oxidative reactions which are assisted by electron transfer mediators (ETMs). Compared with direct oxidation by molecular oxygen (O2), the use of a coupled catalyst system with ETMs leads to a lower overall energy barrier via stepwise electron transfer. This cooperative catalytic process significantly facilitates the transport of electrons from the reduced form of the substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRCred) to O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. In this Minireview, we have summarized the advances accomplished in recent years in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed as well as metal&#8208;free aerobic oxidations of organic molecules in the presence of ETMs. In addition, the recent progress of photochemical and electrochemical oxidative functionalization using ETMs and O2 as the terminal oxidant is also highlighted. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these transformations are showcased.

Furthermore, the mechanisms of these transformations are showcased.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoops Incorporating Donor, Acceptor, Hetero&#8208; or Polycyclic Aromatics</title>

Designer hoops: By incorporating aromatic units with specific electronic (i.e. donor/acceptor) or structural (i.e. chirality) properties, it is possible to modify cycloparaphenylenes and conjugated hoops according to design. This Review provides an overview of such structurally designed hoops, their structural, optoelectronic, and host properties, and potential (future) applications.







Abstract
In the last 13&#8197;years several synthetic strategies were developed that provide access to [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related conjugated nanohoops. A number of potential applications emerged, including optoelectronic devices, and their use as templates for carbon nanomaterials and in supramolecular chemistry. To tune the structural or optoelectronic properties of carbon nanohoops beyond the size&#8208;dependent effect known for [n]CPPs, a variety of aromatic rings other than benzene were introduced. In this Review, we provide an overview of the syntheses, properties, and applications of conjugated nanohoops beyond [n]CPPs with intrinsic donor/acceptor structure or such that contain acceptor, donor, heteroaromatic or polycyclic aromatic units within the hoop as well as conjugated nanobelts.

         <title>Pseudo Natural Products&#8212;Chemical Evolution of Natural Product Structure</title>

Pseudo&#8208;natural products provide new opportunities in the discovery of bioactive small molecules and can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven chemical evolution of natural product structure.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) combine natural product (NP) fragments in novel arrangements not accessible by current biosynthesis pathways. As such they can be regarded as non&#8208;biogenic fusions of NP&#8208;derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Converted In2O3 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15844-15848, July 12, 2021. </description>

15&#8208;nm In2O3 nanocubes as the precatalyst are observed to exhibit greater CO2 reduction selectivity towards formate than bulk&#8208;like samples as well as smaller nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways, suggesting that smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.







Abstract
The size modulation of catalyst particles represents a useful dimension to tune catalytic performances by impacting not only their surface areas but also local electronic structures. It, however, has remained inadequately explored and poorly elucidated. Here, we report the interesting size&#8208;dependent selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction on In2O3 nanocrystals. 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles and 15&#8208;nm nanocubes with focused size distribution are prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction in oleylamine by carefully controlling a set of experimental parameters. They serve as the precatalysts, and are reduced to In nanocrystals while largely inherit the original size feature during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Catalyst derived from 15&#8208;nm nanocubes exhibits greater formate selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) at lower overpotential and negligible side reactions compared to bulk&#8208;like samples (indium foil and 200&#8208;nm cubes) as well as the catalyst derived from smaller 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways by our theoretical computations. Smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.

         <title>Stable Acidic Water Oxidation with a Cobalt&#8211;Iron&#8211;Lead Oxide Catalyst Operating via a Cobalt&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Healing Mechanism</title>

The [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox water oxidation anode catalyst facilitates long&#8208;term O2 evolution reaction in acidic electrolytes at elevated temperatures. Through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism, this catalyst operates in the absence of dissolved Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors deeming it a prospective anode material for low&#8208;cost water electrolyzer systems.







Abstract
The instability and expense of anodes for water electrolyzers with acidic electrolytes can be overcome through the implementation of a cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide electrocatalyst, [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox, that is self&#8208;healing in the presence of dissolved metal precursors. However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half&#8208;reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum H2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox in acidic solutions through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80&#177;1&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56&#177;0.01&#8197;V on a one&#8208;week timescale.

         <title>Engineering a Second&#8208;Order DNA Logic&#8208;Gated Nanorobot to Sense and Release on Live Cell Membranes for Multiplexed Diagnosis and Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15816-15820, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot was fabricated, which was able to identify five cell lines and kill target cells by integrating multiaptamers and multiple drugs. Logic&#8208;gated biocomputing was achieved in physiological conditions within 30&#8197;minutes via a single input of one molecule.







Abstract
Tumor biomarker&#8208;based theranostics have achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker&#8208;based recognition can cause false&#8208;positive feedback, including the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor phenomenon, in the absence of tumor&#8208;specific antigen.

&lt;p&gt;A smart DNA logic-gated nanorobot was fabricated, which was able to identify five cell lines and kill target cells by integrating multiaptamers and multiple drugs. Logic-gated biocomputing was achieved in physiological conditions within 30&#8197;minutes via a single input of one molecule.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor biomarker-based theranostics have achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker-based recognition can cause false-positive feedback, including the on-target off-tumor phenomenon, in the absence of tumor-specific antigen. Multibiomarker-based recognition molecules often elicit nonspecific and undesired internalization when they bind to &#8220;bystander&#8221; cells. We report a universal DNA tetrahedral scaffold (DTS) that anchors on the cell membrane to load multiple aptamers and therapeutics for precise and effective theranostics. This DNA logic-gated nanorobot (DLGN) not only facilitates precise discrimination among five cell lines, but also triggers synergistic killing of effector aptamer-tethered synergistic drugs (EASDs) to target cancer cells. Logic-gated recognition integrated into aptamer-functionalized molecular machines will prompt fast tumor profiling, in&#8197;situ capture and isolation, and safe delivery of precise medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

The three&#8208;step biosynthetic reaction from L&#8208;Val to 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid was reconstituted in vitro. The aziridine synthesis by non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenase TqaL, aziridine ring opening by haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and oxidative decarboxylation by NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM, were characterized. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis.







Abstract
Aziridine is a characteristically reactive molecule with increased bioactivity due to its strained ring structure. Here, we investigated the biosynthesis of 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) in Penicillium, and successfully reconstituted the three&#8208;step biosynthesis from L&#8208;Val to AIB in vitro. This previously unknown aziridine formation pathway proceeded with the non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent (FeII/&#945;KG) oxygenase TqaL, followed by aziridine ring opening by the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (HAD)&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation by the NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the C&#8722;N bond forming FeII/&#945;KG oxygenase TqaL was solved at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis, thereby expanding the catalytic repertoire of the FeII/&#945;KG oxygenases. We also report the unique aziridine ring opening by a HAD&#8208;type hydrolase and the remarkable oxidative decarboxylation by a non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase to produce AIB.

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15803-15808, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanowire electrochemical biosensor for the quantitative measurement of the intravesicular glutamate (Glu) content inside living neurons and its released fractions was developed. It is shown that only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. The sensor opens new possibilities for exploring the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of intravesicular glutamate (Glu) and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire that can selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (ca. 125&#8197;nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. These measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected.

         <title>A Promising NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Sensor for Peptide&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Kidney Dysfunction</title>

The biological metabolism pathways of fluorophores can be altered by elaborately selected hydrophilic peptides. Hepatic cleared organic molecules and fast renal cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after being conjugated to a peptide with high polarity. Based on the selected peptide, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression.







Abstract
Kidney disease is usually &#8220;silent&#8221; at the early stage but can lead to severe kidney failure later on. The development of bioimaging probes with rapid distribution and long&#8208;term retention in the kidney is significant for the precise diagnosis of renal diseases. Here, a strategy for the peptide&#8208;mediated delivery and long&#8208;term accumulation (&gt;48&#8197;h) of second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores into the kidney is demonstrated. It is shown that both the hepatic&#8208;cleared organic molecules and fast renal&#8208;cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugation to the peptide with high polarity. Moreover, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed based on the kidney targeting peptide, which enables both in&#8197;vivo long&#8208;term kidney monitoring and in&#8197;vitro urine analysis. The capability of the peptide&#8208;based sensor to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression is particularly crucial for chemotherapy regimen optimization and timely renoprotective intervention during medication.

KC8 reduction of a hypervalent arsenic heterocycle 4 affords the 1,4&#8208;diarsinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide 5 as a red crystalline solid. The C4As2 ring of 5, formally comprising 8&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electrons, is planar and exhibits antiaromatic character. Two&#8208;electron oxidation of 5 with AgOTf gives the 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4As2&#8208;compound 6, which is an aromatic system.

         <title>Synthesis of a Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;Ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>

A long&#8208;awaited challenging nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) with two bridging thiolates has been synthesized for the first time from the all&#8208;ferric thiolate iron&#8208;sulfur cubane cluster Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).







Abstract
Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) [Tbt=2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S=0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibits two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).

         <title>Non&#8208;Planar Perylene Bisimide Analogues with Inserted Carbonyl and Methylene Subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15838-15843, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) analogues with an inserted carbonyl or methylene moiety are described. The carbonyl&#8208;inserted PBI derivative immediately underwent intersystem crossing in its excited state. The deprotonation of the methylene&#8208;inserted PBI derivative afforded the corresponding carbanion, which underwent redox&#8208;induced reversible C&#8722;C bond formation to provide the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimer almost quantitatively.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of dinaphthotropone bisimide (DNTrBI) and dinaphthocycloheptatriene bisimide (DNCHepBI) are described. Their molecular design is conceptually based on the insertion of a carbon atom into a perylene bisimide (PBI) core. These molecules adopt non&#8208;planar structures due to the presence of a seven&#8208;membered ring. The PBI derivative into which a carbonyl group was inserted (DNTrBI) immediately underwent nonradiative decay and/or intersystem crossing in its excited state. The PBI derivative into which a methylene group was inserted (DNCHepBI) was susceptible to deprotonation on account of the two electron&#8208;withdrawing naphthalene monoimide units. Subsequent aerobic oxidation resulted in the formation of a C&#8722;C bond at the central methylene unit, thus affording a &#963;&#8208;dimer. The formation of this C&#8722;C bond is dynamically redox&#8208;active, i.e., electron injection into the &#963;&#8208;dimer almost quantitatively regenerated the deprotonated DNCHepBI.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15832-15837, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward electrochemical synthesis of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds is presented. The electrolysis proceeds at room temperature in an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, giving &#955;3&#8208;bromanes in good yields on the gram scale from bromoarenes. The reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes can be enhanced by Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid additives as demonstrated in &#955;3&#8208;bromane&#8208;mediated oxidative biaryl formation.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to hypervalent iodine(III) compounds, the isoelectronic bromine(III) counterparts have been little studied to date. This knowledge gap is mainly attributed to the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes as well as to their challenging preparation from the highly toxic and corrosive BrF3 precursor. In this context, we present a straightforward and scalable approach to chelation&#8208;stabilized &#955;3&#8208;bromanes by anodic oxidation of parent aryl bromides possessing two coordinating hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanyl substituents. A series of para&#8208;substituted &#955;3&#8208;bromanes with remarkably high redox potentials spanning a range from 1.86&#8197;V to 2.60&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgNO3 was synthesized by the electrochemical method. We demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of the bench&#8208;stable bromine(III) species can be unlocked by addition of a Lewis or a Br&#248;nsted acid. The synthetic utility of the &#955;3&#8208;bromane activation is exemplified by oxidative C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions.

         <title>Heteroatom Cycloaddition at the (BN)2 Bay Region of Dibenzoperylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15798-15802, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first acid&#8208;catalyzed heteroatom cycloaddition at the (BN)2 bay region of a dibenzoperylene with different aldehydes. This new method allows the synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the formation of 1,3,5,2,4&#8208;oxadiazadiborinane (B2N2CO) rings.







Abstract
Cycloaddition&#8208;dehydration involving a BNBN&#8208;butadiene analogue at the bay region of a dibenzoperylene and a non&#8208;enolizable aldehyde provides a novel strategy for incorporation of the oxadiazadiborinane (B2N2CO) ring into the scaffold of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon resulting in highly emissive compounds.

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one &#8208; light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Cycloaddition Reactions of a Reactive Internally N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;stabilized Boraalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of element&#8208;carbon double bonds is of great importance for the development and understanding of reactive &#960;&#8208;bonded systems in chemistry. The seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic system 4b is readily made by internal C&#8211;H activation at a pendent isopropyl methyl group of the respective [(IPr)C6F5BH]+ borenium ion. Subsequent deprotonation with the IMes carbene gives the neutral cyclic boraalkene system 5b. The B=C double bond in compound 5b adds carbon dioxide, CS2, sulfur dioxide, phenyl isocyanate, an acetylene ester or two NO molecules to give the corresponding four&#8208;membered ring annulated heterocycles. With sulfur or selenium 5b gives the respective three&#8208;membered ring systems. N2O reacts with 5b to give a mixture of the related oxaborinane 18 and a unique [B]OH containing diazoalkane product 19. The neutral B=C functionality in compound 5b shows a reactivity of a reactive polar &#960;&#8208;bond.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  ) mixture is highly desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation technique. Realizing efficient C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging and has been rarely reported due to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a rare example of functionalized HOF (termed as  HOF&#8208;16  ) with free &#8210;COOH sites for the e&#64259;cient separation of C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  mixtures. Under ambient conditions,  HOF&#8208;16  shows a significant C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  uptake difference (by 76%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to those of other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8210;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of  HOF&#8208;16  has also been validated by breakthrough experiments.  HOF&#8208;16  is stable in harsh condition including strong acidity and water.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Dehydrating Bimodules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Biosynthesis: A Showcase Study on Hepatoprotective Hangtaimycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation led to the isolation of hangtaimycin (HTM) from Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 and the discovery of its hepatoprotective properties. Structure elucidation by NMR suggested the need for a structural revision. A putative HTM degradation product was also isolated and its structure was confirmed by total synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and resembles a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery whose first PKS enzyme contains an internal dehydrating bimodule, which is usually found split in other trans&#8208;AT PKSs. The mechanisms of such dehydrating bimodules have often been proposed, but have never been deeply investigated. Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Carbene Analogues: Donor&#8208;Free Phosphenium and Arsenium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenes and their analogues have constantly enthralled chemists with their intriguing reactivity of ambiphilic character stemming from their electronic structures. Phosphenium and arsenium ions are fiercely reactive cationic species, the stabilization of which has been so far achieved in condensed phase by dispersing the positive charge through electromeric conjugation with at least one electron rich substituent (frequently amido groups). Although observed in gas phase, the isolation of dicoordinate phosphenium and arsenium ions lacking such stabilizing ligands has eluded chemists for decades. Herein we show that by judicious choice of aromatic substituents dicoordinate, donor&#8208;free, Lewis&#8208;superacidic phosphenium and arsenium ions can be kinetically stabilized. They feature singlet electronic ground states possessing a vacant p&#8208;orbital and an electron lone pair with predominantly s&#8208;character.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a [5+2] cycloaddition between readily accessible 1&#8208;indanones and internal alkynes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed activation of less strained C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction is enabled by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligand and a carefully modified temporary directing group. A wide range of functional groups is tolerated, and the method provides straightforward access to diverse benzocycloheptenones that are hard to access otherwise. DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in the transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition of the true and false resonance Raman optical activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B  12  derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory. Neglecting the ECD effect during ROA measurement can lead to misinterpretation of the recorded spectra and erroneous conclusions about the molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective bond cleavage in RAFT agents promoted by low&#8208;energy electron attachment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture.&#160; For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8208;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (&#8729;CH  3  in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrolactonization Reactions Driven by a Pentafluorobenzoyl Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrolactones constitute a privileged class of natural and synthetic products with a broad range of applications in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Despite all the progress made towards their synthesis, notably from  seco  &#8208;acids, a macrolactonization promoter system that is effective, selective, flexible, readily available, and, insofar as possible, compatible with manifold functional groups is still lacking. Herein, we describe a strategy that relies on the formation of a mixed anhydride incorporating a pentafluorophenyl group which, due to its high electronic activation enables a convenient access to macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with a broad versatility. Kinetic studies and DFT computations were performed to rationalize the reactivity of the pentafluorophenyl group in macrolactonization reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition for synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed. The regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities are controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Pyridines with 5&#8208;substitutents could be obtained with above 20 : 1 regioselectivity and up to 94%  ee  when terminal alkyl, alkenyl or silyl alkynes and DTBM/phenyl&#8208;based NPN* ligand  L6  are used. The applying of terminal aryl alkynes and phenyl/benzyl&#8208;based ligand  L4  leads to formation of pyridines with reversed 6&#8208;substitutents in up to 99%  ee  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytic formation of borylamines from atmospheric N  2  is achieved for the first time using a series of homogenous (triphosphine)Mo complexes. Stepwise functionnalization of the (triphosphine)Mo&#8208;nitrido complex with chloroborane led the synthesis of the imido complex. Electrochemical characterization of the (PPP)Mo&#8208;nitrido and (PPP)Mo&#8208;borylimido complexes showed that the latter is much more easily reduced.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral (dihydro)furo&#8208;fused heterocycles are significant structural motifs in numerous natural products, functional materials and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing efficient methods for preparing compounds with these privileged scaffolds is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cascade reaction of readily available linear &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with aromatic alkenes, affording a wide variety of structurally fused heterocyclic molecules in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Of note, this method provides a platform for building three types of valuable dihydrofuro&#8208;fused rigid tricyclic architectures that have great synthetic challenges. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that the bifunctional phosphonium salt catalyst controlled the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of this cascade transformation, particularly proceeding through the initial ketone &#945;&#8208;addition followed by  O  &#8208;participated substitution; and the multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between Br&#248;nsted acid moieties of catalyst and nitro group of aromatic alkene were crucial in asymmetric induction. Given the generality, versatility, and high efficiency of this method, we anticipate that it will have broad synthetic utilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Molecules or Semiconductors in Photocatalysis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of solids, Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for a rationale&#8208;based engineering of tailored physical properties. These derive from the modular, molecular make&#8208;up of MOFs, which allows for the selection and modification of the organic and inorganic building units that construct them. The adaptable properties make MOFs interesting materials for photocatalysis, an area of increasing significance. But the molecular and porous nature of a MOs leaves the field, in some areas, juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. While descriptors from both fields are applied in tandem, the gap between theory and experiment has widened in some area&#8217;s, and arguably needs fixing.
Here we review, on the basis of the literature, where MOFs have shown to be similar to conventional semiconductors in photocatalysis, and where they have shown to be more like infinite molecules in solution. We do this from the perspective of band theory, which in the context of photocatalysis, covers both the molecular and nonmolecular principles of relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma Tuning Local Environment of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexagonal boron nitride (  h  &#8208;BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides. However, high crystallinity of commercial  h  &#8208;BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency. Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N  2  , O  2  , H  2  , Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of  h  &#8208;BN. N  2  &#8208;treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520 &#176;C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that &#8220;three&#8208;boron center&#8221; N&#8208;defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. While the sintering effect of the &#8220;BO  x  &#8221; species in O  2  &#8208;treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520 &#176;C).</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of Zinc onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the Ionic Liquid [MPPip][TFSI]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and of additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. In this contribution we show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Clearly different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Hydration Barrier of Lignin Oleate Nanoparticles for Acid&#8208; and Base&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization in Dispersion State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are promising renewable nanomaterials with applications ranging from biomedicine to water purification. However, instability of LNPs under acidic and basic conditions severely limits their functionalization for improved performance. Here, we show that controlling the degree of esterification can significantly improve the stability of lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) in acidic and basic aqueous dispersions. The high stability of OLNPs is attributed to the alkyl chains accumulated in the shell of the particle, which delays protonation/deprotonation of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl groups. Owing to the enhanced stability, acid&#8208; and base&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of OLNPs at pH 2.0 and pH 12.0 via oxirane ring&#8208;opening reactions were successfully performed. We also demonstrate these new functionalized particles as efficient pH&#8208;switchable dye adsorbents and anticorrosive particulate coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Mediated Photoredox Catalysis Enables Self&#8208;Reporting Nitric Oxide Release for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) serves as not only a key regulator of many physiological processes but also a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non&#8208;invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO&#8208;releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near&#8208;UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity. Here, we report that coumarin&#8208;based NO donors with maximal absorbances at 328 nm can be activated under (deep) red light (630 or 700 nm) irradiation in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin, enabling stoichiometric and self&#8208;reporting NO release with a photolysis quantum yield of 8% via photoredox catalysis. This NO&#8208;releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in vivo.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report a strategy for the systematic variation of atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric P,N&#8208;ligands to incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket without modifying their steric parameters. &#160;More specifically, the effects of systematic modification of the nitrogen heterocycle in atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric ligands have been investigated in this study.

         <title>Probing the Paradigm of Promiscuity for N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes and their Protein Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes can be considered a &#8216;paradigm of promiscuity&#8217; when it comes to their reactions with proteins. They often form adducts with a variety of donor atoms in an unselective manner. We have characterized the adducts formed between a series of isostructural  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir centers and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Distinctive behavior for the metal compounds was observed with the more labile Ru and Rh complexes targeting a surface l&#8208;histidine moiety through cleavage of  p&#8208;  cymene or NHC co&#8208;ligands, respectively. In contrast, the more inert Os and Ir derivatives were detected in an electronegative binding pocket after undergoing ligand exchange of a chlorido ligand for an amino acid side chain. Computational studies supported the binding profiles and hinted at the role of the protein microenvironment for metal complexes eliciting selectivity for specific binding sites on the protein.</dc:description>
