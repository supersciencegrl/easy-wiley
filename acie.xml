         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic regulation of intermolecular interactions is essential for the creation of dynamic supramolecular materials with lifelike self&#8208;regulating functions. Yet specific ion effect, which is known to possess potent effect on intermolecular interactions, has remained unexplored for such a purpose. Here, we demonstrate our access to dynamic self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular hydrogels by orchestrating the Hofmeister effect through a simple enzymatic reaction. The involved gelators containing carboxylate moieties self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel1) at acidic pH and dissolve at basic pH. We surprisingly find that the dissolved gelators at basic pH can be driven to self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel2) by kosmotropic ions through the disruption of gelator&#8208;water interactions. By coupling to the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, Gel1 gradually disintegrates over time because of the production of basic NH3. However, interestingly, with the accumulation of kosmotropic ions, NH4+ and CO32&#8208;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self&#8208;assemble into Gel2, realizing a self&#8208;regulating gel&#8208;sol&#8208;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion&#8208;programmed biosensing and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Target Agnostic Photoaffinity Labelling by Sulfonylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonyl hydrazones were identified as new photo&#8208;crosslinkers exploiting their base catalyzed low&#8208;energy photoactivation that leads to reactive carbenes. The amino acid promiscuity, their usefulness in proteomics application and the range of labelled targets including enzymes, a PPI target and a transcription factor suggests that sulfonyl hydrazones might be a target agnostic alternative to current photoaffinity tags. Their synthetic availability and the option of late&#8208;stage formation make them beneficial in both chemical biology and drug discovery applications.







Abstract
Photoaffinity labeling is a widely used methodology for interrogating small molecule&#8208;protein interactions. However, these applications are limited by the few photo&#8208;crosslinkers that typically modify the affinity and the binding mode of the original ligand. Here, we report the development of new target agnostic photoaffinity warheads, sulfohydrazones that form a reactive carbene upon UV irradiation. Careful optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to effectively label five different amino acid residues in proteins. Our approach turned biologically relevant hydrazones and sulfohydrazones to intrinsically irreversible covalent binders without structural modifications by photoactivation as demonstrated on monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) enzyme and STAT5b (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b) transcription factor. Sulfohydrazones are readily accessible by transforming the corresponding carbonyl group of a ligand or a suitable tag that extends the application domain of the method for any ligands exemplified by conditional labelling of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme and the oncogenic mutant of GTP&#8208;ase KRasG12D.

         <title>A Green and Efficient Recycling Strategy for Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Neutral Solution Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the overuse of strong acids and bases in the conventional hydrometallurgy process, a delicate strategy has been proposed, which is pioneeringly applied in the neutral solution environment. Particularly, in situ primary battery effect based on the solid&#8208;solid reduction is designed and constructed, which can effectively enhance the reduction efficiency of high&#8208;valent metals by leveraging electron transfer during the neutral leaching. Thus, it can achieve ultrafast efficiency with reduced chemical consumption and corrosive wastewater, thus providing a promising and economic pathway for the battery recycling.







Abstract
Traditional acid or/and ammonia leaching techniques are usually applied to extract valuable metals during hydrometallurgical recovery of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the excessive and repeated use of acids and bases inevitably increases the environmental burden and safety threats. Herein, considering the advantages of neutral pH solution system in terms of safety and environmental protection, neutral leaching has been pioneeringly proposed to achieve a low&#8208;cost and harmless hydrometallurgical process. Specifically, benefited from the ligand complexation reaction of glycine, the valuable metals can be efficiently leached within neutral environment. More importantly, a strategy of solid&#8208;solid reduction with primary batteries effect is employed to achieve an efficient neutral leaching within rapid time, breaking through the reaction limitation of shrinking core model. As anticipated, an efficient leaching of 99.99&#8201;% Li, 96.86&#8201;% Ni, 92.35&#8201;% Co, and 90.59&#8201;% Mn can be achieved within 15 minutes, which has extended applications for various kinds of layered cathodes. Therefore, it is sturdily confirmed that the intractable problem, the effective extraction is available only under the aggressive acid/alkali&#8208;ion conditions, is well&#8208;solved within a mild leaching atmosphere. This green and efficient strategy in neutral solution environment opens a new pathway to realize the large&#8208;scale pollution&#8208;free recycling of spent batteries.

         <title>Catalyst Improved Stereoselectivity and Regioselectivity Control to Access Completely Alternating Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with Enhanced Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral (BisSalen)Al catalyst promoted highly regioselective and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization was achieved, delivering completely alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with enhanced thermal property, linear degradation and controlled drug release behavior. The completely alternating sequence makes the resultant PLGA an ideal carrier for mild long&#8208;acting drug delivery.







Abstract
The poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) with completely alternating sequence has attracted growing attention as an ideal candidate in controlled drug delivery. However, the approach to completely alternating PLGA remains a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of completely alternating PLGA via highly regioselective and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The chiral (BisSalen)Al catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of enantiopure 3&#8208;methyl glycolide (MeG) with highly glycolyl site selectivity, affording alternating PLGA with regioselectivity up to more than 99&#8201;%. Impressively, the completely alternating PLGA exhibited a well&#8208;defined melting temperature Tm of 143.1&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, a stereocomplex between PLLGA and PDLGA was also formed with the improved Tm of 211.8&#8201;&#176;C. The In vitro degradation and drug release experiments revealed the linear degradation and controlled drug release behavior of completely alternating PLGA, which can be used as an ideal carrier for mild long&#8208;acting drug delivery. Meanwhile, the reason of the high regioselectivity was investigated through the control experiments and DFT calculation. This highly regioselective (BisSalen)Al catalyst opens a door to providing completely alternating polymers.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transmission and Amplification from Cellulose Derivative to Achiral Helical Polymer for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of cellulose derivative and racemic helical polyacetylene achieves full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The elegant combination of solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transmission and fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption further enables the CPL handedness and intensity to be easily tunable, providing a novel strategy for the construction and performance regulation of cellulose&#8208;based chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Cellulose derivatives represent a promising natural chiral platform for creating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials owing to their excellent processability and structural diversity. However, achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions based on cellulose derivatives remains challenging. The present work reports the first success in achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions leveraging chirality transmission and amplification from cellulose derivative to achiral helical polymer. Importantly, such chirality transfer displays a dependence on the hydrogen bond accepting ability of solvent, making it effortless to precisely regulate chiral intensity by single or combined solvents. Moreover, the induced chirality in helical polymer is further transferred to the introduced racemic fluorescent dyes, resulting in full&#8208;color and white&#8208;light CPL emissions with a maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and 62.9&#8201;%, respectively. Further spatially separating the chiral and fluorescent components allows inversion of CPL handedness and precise modulation of CPL intensity. Notably, circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and chiral logic gate with multiple information outputs are successfully developed. This work gives an impetus to construct cellulosic chiroptical materials, offering more insights into chirality transfer between biomacromolecules and synthetic helical polymers.

&lt;p&gt;The synergistic effect of cellulose derivative and racemic helical polyacetylene achieves full-color and white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The elegant combination of solvent-dependent chirality transmission and fluorescence-selective absorption further enables the CPL handedness and intensity to be easily tunable, providing a novel strategy for the construction and performance regulation of cellulose-based chiroptical materials.

         <title>Engineering Surface Tension of Active Layer Solutions to form Uniform Films on Water Surface for Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Photovoltaic Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicone oil additive is introduced to substantially reduce surface tension of active layer solutions. High net spreading coefficient was achieved, which enabled solution drops to spread into large&#8208;area films on water surface with the help of Marangoni force. Flexible modules with an active area of 32.5 cm2 and a PCE of 14.3% was achieved through the Marangoni force&#8208;assisted coated (MAC) method







Abstract
Fabricating large&#8208;area uniform thin (about 100&#8197;nm) active layer films via solution processing is still challenging to realize efficient scalable organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules. In this work, we report a method to fabricate large&#8208;area active layer films with the help of Marangoni force via engineering the surface tension of their solutions. Silicone oil was first adopted as an additive to substantially reduce surface tension of the active layer solutions from 34.8 to 20.6 mN/m. Large&#8208;area (up to 700&#8197;cm2) thin active layer films formed spontaneously on water by Marangoni force due to the increased surface tension difference between the active layer solution and water. The films were then transferred onto charge transporting layer to fabricate devices. The active layer films fabricated by Marangoni force&#8208;assisted coating (MAC) displayed power conversion efficiencies (PCE), 17.4&#8201;&#177;0.3&#8201;% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, 17.9&#177;0.7&#8201;% for D18:N3 and 16.4&#177;0.3&#8201;% for PM6:QM&#8208;1. Furthermore, large&#8208;area (32.5&#8197;cm2) OPV modules were fabricated based on the MAC method with a PCE of 14.3&#8201;%. This is the first example that MAC method is used to successfully fabricate efficient OPV modules via the surface tension engineering of active layer films with silicone oil used as a low surface tension additive.

         <title>Quantum Chemical Understanding of the O2 Release Process from Nature's Water Splitting Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations reveal that O2 release from nature's water splitting cofactor is initiated by the Mn3&#8722;O5 bond cleavage, without an initial conformational change of the peroxide [O5&#8208;Ox]2&#8722; group. This pathway is kinetically dominant because of the maximum stability of the rate&#8208;limiting transition state.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis plays a vital role in the supply of energy and oxygen necessary for the survival of biological organisms. The current leading proposal of the O&#8722;O bond formation in photosystem II suggests the coupling between the central &#956;&#8208;oxo (O5) and the additional oxygenic ligand (Ox) of the manganese&#8208;calcium oxide cofactor. However, the subsequent process through which molecular dioxygen is formed and released remains elusive. In this report, quantum chemical calculations reveal that the O2 release process is initiated by the cleavage of the Mn&#8722;O5 bond, without a preliminary conformational change of the peroxide [O5&#8208;Ox]2&#8722; group. Subsequently, the [O5&#8208;Ox] moiety is converted from the superoxide to the weakly bound quasi&#8208;O2 where the Mn&#8722;Ox bond is cleaved, and after a twist of the quasi&#8208;O2 unit, the free O2 is ultimately released. Alternative pathways display significantly slower kinetics, due to the lower structural stabilities of the rate&#8208;limiting transition states. The cause of the difference is associated with the Jahn&#8208;Teller axial orientation and the local ring strain within the Mn cluster. These findings contribute to unravelling the intricate mechanism involved in an important step of photosynthetic oxygen evolution for a deeper understanding of nature's water oxidation catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zinc Halogen Aqueous Battery Exploiting [BrCl2]&#8722; Storage in Ketjenblack by Reconstructing Electrolyte Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance zinc halogen aqueous battery has been developed by creating new [Br2Cl]&#8722;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8722;/Cl&#8722; redox couples, utilizing sophisticated nanopore confinement within a Ketjenblack host and coordination chemistry via reconstructing electrolyte structure, which delivers an impressive discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g|KB&#8722;1 and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg|KB&#8722;1.







Abstract
Halogen redox couples offer distinct merits due to high redox potential and low cost, but they usually suffer from poor reversibility. Here, we report highly reversible [Br2Cl]&#8722;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8722;/Cl&#8722; redox couples via harnessing interhalogen chemistry within nanoporous Ketjenblack (KB) carbon as a host for zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries. The tunable halogen reactions are facilitated by controllable coordinating chemistry of [ZnCl4&#8208;xBrx]2&#8722; in a hydrated deep eutectic solvent electrolyte comprising ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and choline chloride (C5H14ClNO). In an optimized electrolyte, the KB electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;gKB&#8722;1 or 214&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 when the stored [BrCl2]&#8722; is counted at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an average discharge voltage of ~1.6&#8197;V, and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgKB&#8722;1 or 315&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, when considering the mass of [BrCl2]&#8722; as well. Benefiting from the interhalogen coordination chemistry and KB pore host, the pouch cell delivers an areal capacity of 2.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, storing an energy density of ~80&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of both electrodes. This work offers a new strategy to enhance the reversibility of static aqueous halogen batteries for energy storage applications.

         <title>Highly Entangled Hydrogels by Photoiniferter&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>

Ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities were synthesized by photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). The resulting hydrogels contain high density of trapped entanglements which impart enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite the vanishingly small crosslinking densities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAm) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities by trithiocarbonate photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). Fixing the photoiniferter to crosslinker ratio and gradually increasing the targeted degree of polymerization (DPtarget) allowed for simultaneous control over the crosslinking density and the average molecular weight (Mn) of the primary chains, both below and above the critical molecular weight of entanglement (Mc). Interestingly, a plateau in storage moduli (G&#8217;) was observed for UHMW PDMAm hydrogels with a sufficiently high DPtarget (&gt;5,000), indicating a transition to the entanglement&#8208;dominated regime, with no contribution from crosslinks to the overall modulus, thus indicating the formation of highly entangled hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite their vanishingly small crosslinking densities. Furthermore, even when equipped with cleavable crosslinkers, the UHMW PDMAm hydrogels resist degradation due to dense entanglements which act as transient crosslinks preventing the gels from swelling, while sparse covalent crosslinks help to maintain their structural integrity and avoid chain disentanglement. This approach allows simple synthesis of elastic and tough hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined structure and tuneable contributions from both crosslinks and entanglements.

         <title>Molecular Origin of the Stretchability and Fatigue&#8208;Resistance of Rotaxane&#8208;Based Mechanically Interlocked Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked polymers exhibit various functionalities for promising applications. Notably, while enhanced stretchability and superior fatigue resistance have been primarily attributed to the sliding of rotaxanes, the intrinsic role of mechanical interlocking itself has remained underappreciated. Herein, densely crosslinked SPN and MIN systems are developed to reveal the interlocked architectures as the fundamental molecular mechanisms of mechanical enhancement.







Abstract
Rotaxane&#8208;based polymer networks leveraging host&#8211;guest recognition have recently emerged as a versatile platform for developing smart materials. Despite numerous studies on these polymers, their unique mechanical properties are mostly associated with the sliding motion of the macrocycle along the axle, leaving the impact of the presence or absence of interlocked structures on the mechanical performance of materials yet to be directly demonstrated. In this work, we present a densely (pseudo)rotaxane&#8208;based supramolecular polymeric network (SPN) and a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) as model systems to explore how the mechanical interlocking unit dominates the material properties. Specifically, we have achieved a significant transition from SPN to MIN by finely tuning the stopper size, just substituting a methyl with a dimethyl group attached to the phenyl ring. Although their stereochemical structures are similar, a subtle increase in the stopper size can lead to striking improvements in stretchability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. The stopper size&#8208;relevant dethreading behavior, as evidenced by a combined approach of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and rheology, is the underlying molecular mechanism for the difference in the macroscopic mechanical properties. We anticipate that the fundamental understanding gained from this work will advance the development of rotaxane&#8208;based materials with emergent functions and applications.

         <title>Lactate&#8208;Modulating Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial Respiration Block for Tumor Immunosuppression Remodeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;dopped copper nitride (Cu3N&#8722;C) acts as a lactate oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme. C doping enhances n&#8722;&#963;* delocalization of the oxygen lone pair from lactate C&#8722;OH bond, weakening hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H for efficient lactate dehydrogenation, which benefits tumor immunosuppression remodeling. The as&#8208;generated pyruvate is further blocked for influx into mitochondrial respiration via inhibition of PDH complex by Cu3N&#8722;C.







Abstract
Abnormal lactate metabolism in tumor cells leads to immune escape in the tumor microenvironment. Intervening in specific lactate metabolic pathways while blocking downstream pyruvate influx holds great promise for overcoming conventional lactate&#8208;targeted therapy limitations such as short half&#8208;life, insufficient lactate consumption, and pathological microenvironment elasticity. Herein, a nanocatalytic medicine based on carbondoping engineered copper nitride enzyme (Cu3N&#8722;C NE) with enhanced lactate oxidase (LOX) activity was carefully designed. Computational results revealed that the introduction of C favors activation of the hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H bond in lactate by the polarization of adjacent hydroxyl groups, correspondingly facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the desired &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;H groups in lactate via the hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) process. The Cu3N&#8722;C NEs could downregulate lactate levels in tumor cells for robust remodeling of the immunosuppressive microenvironment and further block as&#8208;generated pyruvate to influx into the mitochondrial respiration, achieving lactate homeostasis reprogramming. Our study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of next&#8208;generation lactate&#8208;modulation nanomedicine via heteroatom&#8208;doping and evolution with the additional potential to expedite the industrial production of lactate to pyruvate.

         <title>Noble Gas Provides a Solution to the Synthesis&#8208;On&#8208;Inert&#8208;Surfaces Challenge for Extended Covalent Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noblesse oblige! The noble gas argon can be used to form carbon&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbon thioether&#8208;based nanostructures on inert surfaces such as graphite. In contrast to on&#8208;surface synthesis on metal surfaces, this may allow the exploration of novel field&#8208;effect devices.







Abstract
A key milestone in the field of On&#8208;Surface Synthesis (OSS) is the development of generic protocols for covalent coupling on inert surfaces. Typically, metal surfaces are used in OSS, but the strong interactions distort the intrinsic properties of the synthesized nanostructures and therefore compromise their applicability. Inert surfaces, on the other hand, preserve the nanostructures&#8217; unique properties, but present challenges during synthesis: Activation energies are generally higher than on metal surfaces, hence thermally activated coupling on inert surfaces is severely hampered by competing premature desorption of the reactants. Using the coupling of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;mercaptophenyl)benzene (TMB) via carbon&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbon thioether bonds, we demonstrate that annealing in a noble gas atmosphere instead of in a vacuum kinetically inhibits desorption. This allows covalent coupling on both inert graphite and even more weakly interacting graphene surfaces. We anticipate generic potential for this approach, with future experiments exploring the expandability of ambient pressure annealing to a portfolio of other coupling protocols.

         <title>Expanding the Molecular Switches Toolbox: Photoreloadable Dithienylethene Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalizing dithienylethene with polycaprolactone creates a robust mechanophore that once activated by UV light, lose its red color under sonication. The thermally&#8208;forbidden ring opening reaction is better mediated when force is applied at the 5,5&#8242;&#8208; positions of the scaffold. Uniquely, the DTE&#8208;polymer conjugates can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic and ultrasound radiation, which makes them reloadable.







Abstract
Molecular switches are often thought of as nanoscopic equivalents to the electrical buttons and knobs ubiquitous in everyday life. However, mechanical force is rarely used to reversibly trigger rearrangements at the atomic scale, due to the difficulty in selectively breaking certain bonds, while keeping others intact. Here, we introduce two new mechanophores based on dithienylethene (DTE), which can be toggled between two states by ultraviolet light and sonication. Attaching various lengths of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) either to the 2,2&#8242; or the 5,5&#8242; positions of the DTE core allowed us to study the kinetics of its mechanochemical cycloreversion. We employed computational methods to understand the root causes of the observed mechano&#8208;regiochemical differences. Lastly, we show that our best performing DTE&#8208;polymer conjugate can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical force.

     alt="Expanding the Molecular Switches Toolbox: Photoreloadable Dithienylethene Mechanophores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionalizing dithienylethene with polycaprolactone creates a robust mechanophore that once activated by UV light, lose its red color under sonication. The thermally-forbidden ring opening reaction is better mediated when force is applied at the 5,5&#8242;- positions of the scaffold. Uniquely, the DTE-polymer conjugates can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic and ultrasound radiation, which makes them reloadable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular switches are often thought of as nanoscopic equivalents to the electrical buttons and knobs ubiquitous in everyday life. However, mechanical force is rarely used to reversibly trigger rearrangements at the atomic scale, due to the difficulty in selectively breaking certain bonds, while keeping others intact. Here, we introduce two new mechanophores based on dithienylethene (DTE), which can be toggled between two states by ultraviolet light and sonication. Attaching various lengths of poly(&#1013;-caprolactone) either to the 2,2&#8242; or the 5,5&#8242; positions of the DTE core allowed us to study the kinetics of its mechanochemical cycloreversion. We employed computational methods to understand the root causes of the observed mechano-regiochemical differences. Lastly, we show that our best performing DTE-polymer conjugate can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical force.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insight into the Enantioselectivity of (R)&#8208;Selective Styrene Monooxygenases: A Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Proximal and Distal Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of an (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenase (SeStyA) revealed that the sizes of two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312) relative to the C=C bond govern substrate binding orientation by a distinct &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; mechanism that determines enantioselectivity. Based on this mechanism, a series of SeStyA variants were engineered to produce both enantiomers with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Group E flavoprotein monooxygenases (GEMs) are well&#8208;known for catalyzing enantioselective epoxidation reactions. However, engineering their enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge, largely due to a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Among these enzymes, (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenases ((R)&#8208;SMOs) stand out due to their unusual enantio&#8208;switch behavior when catalyzing the reactions of p&#8208;substituted styrenes. This unique property provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate the enantiocontrol mechanisms within GEMs. In this study, we resolved the first crystal structure of an (R)&#8208;SMO, SeStyA, derived from Streptomyces. By integrating this structural information with molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified four key residues critical to enantiodivergency: two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312). Strikingly, a &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; mechanism was revealed through saturation mutagenesis, wherein the side&#8208;chain sizes of proximal and distal residues exerted opposing influences on enantioselectivity at the C=C bond. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we successfully engineered SMOs with excellent (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity.

         <title>Identifying the Key Photosensitizing Factors over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Selective Control of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing MOF molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1&#8211; UiO&#8208;4) was constructed by engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for clarifying the relationship between photosensitizing factors and ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 to O2&#8901;&#8722; generation varied from 0&#8201;:&#8201;100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 for UiO&#8208;4, demonstrating an effective regulation of ROS generation by modulating photosensitizing factors.







Abstract
The reaction pathway, product selectivity and catalytic efficiency of photo&#8208;oxidation are highly dependent on the specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;), generated via the sensitization of O2 by photosensitizers. Studies on uncovering the role of photosensitizing factors on the selective control of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; generation are significant but remain underexplored. Here, we constructed a photosensitizing metal&#8211;organic framework molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1&#8211;UiO&#8208;4) by elaborately engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for modulating photosensitizing factors and elucidating their impact on ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; generation varied from 0&#8201;:&#8201;100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 for UiO&#8208;4 by modulating photosensitizing factors. UiO&#8208;2 and UiO&#8208;4 were respectively immobilized in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, achieving gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of phenol and juglone with high purity (&gt;94&#8201;%) via O2&#8901;&#8722; and 1O2 pathway, respectively. Investigations reveal that UiO&#8208;4 with ligand localized excited state and long excited state lifetime contributed to triggering energy transfer to afford 1O2, whereas UiO&#8208;1 with charge&#8208;transfer state and negative reduction potential facilitates charge transfer to produce O2&#8901;&#8722;. This work offers a novel insight into regulating ROS generation by modulating the photosensitizing factors at the molecular level.

         <title>An Artificial Copper&#8208;Michaelase Featuring a Genetically Encoded Bipyridine Ligand for Asymmetric Additions to Nitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient artificial copper&#8208;dependent Michaelase featuring a metal&#8208;binding unnatural amino acid, e.&#8201;g. bipyridyl alanine (BpyA), was optimized through directed evolution and applied in catalytic asymmetric additions of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes. Various chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Moreover, the reaction was performed at preparative scale and the product was used in follow&#8208;up derivatization reactions towards various high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are an attractive approach to achieving &#8220;new to nature&#8221; biocatalytic transformations. In this work, a novel copper&#8208;dependent artificial Michaelase (Cu_Michaelase) comprising a genetically encoded copper&#8208;binding ligand, i.&#8201;e. (2,2&#8208;bipyridin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)alanine (BpyA), was developed. For the first time, such an ArM containing a non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding amino acid was successfully optimized through directed evolution. The evolved Cu_Michaelase was applied in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes, yielding various &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives, which are precursors for a range of high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds, with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Additionally, the evolved variant could be further used in a preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, providing chiral products for diverse derivatizations. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis confirmed the binding of Cu(II) ions to the BpyA residues and showed that, in principle, there is sufficient space for the 2&#8208;acetyl azaarene substrate to coordinate. Kinetic studies showed that the increased catalytic efficiency of the evolved enzyme is due to improvements in apparent KM for both substrates and a notable threefold increase in apparent kcat for 2&#8208;acetyl pyridine. This work illustrates the potential of artificial metalloenzymes exploiting non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding ligands for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis.

The full&#8208;scale regulation of O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is achieved through ternary&#8208;lattice&#8208;site doping combined with a perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 surface coating. This strategy optimizes the interlayer structure and establishes a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which further alleviating intrinsic lattice strain, suppressing disordered FeO64+ migration, and mitigating undesirable interfacial reactions. As anticipated, the as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF cathode demonstrates impressive rate capability and excellent cycle durability at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut&#8208;off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero&#8208;elements, synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk multifunctionally full&#8208;scale modified O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 protective layer in situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca2+ pillars, robust Zr&#8722;O bonds and the highly electronegative F&#8722; are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na&#8208;TM&#8722;O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO6 octahedra and facilitating Na+ diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8208;OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted Fe4+O6 is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep&#8208;desodiation state. Consequently, as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 2&#8197;C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff&#8208;site and external surface structure for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced durability.

         <title>Zinc(II)&#8208;Enhanced Excimer Probe for Recognition of MDMB&#8208;CA Synthetic Cannabinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific sensing strategy towards MDMB&#8208;CA series synthetic cannabinoids was pioneered upon a novel metal&#8208;enhanced excimer probe, accompanied with a transforming luminescence mechanism from excimer emission to FRET effect before and after detection. The proposed probe exhibited the desirable sensing performances towards MDMB&#8208;CA series with sensitive (ng level), rapid (&lt;5&#8197;s) and specific discrimination of the target from the analogues.







Abstract
Specific recognition with optical responses towards the analytes which are structurally diverse and weak chemical&#8208;active remains a big challenge but is of great significance. Here, a zinc(II) enhanced fluorescent emission probe was developed by conjugated modulating and metal bridging to specifically recognize synthetic cannabinoids (SCs). The transformed luminescence mechanism from excimer emission to fluorescence resonance energy transfer was demonstrated upon the integration of coordination and non&#8208;covalent interactions towards target SCs. As a result, the specific and instant detection of the certain type SCs (MDMB&#8208;CA series) was achieved in complicated sample medium. Hence, we envisage that this work would not only offer a novel recognition strategy for SCs, but also advance the development of the optical sensing probe especially for analyzing the substances with diverse structures and weak chemical&#8208;activity, as well as for fighting against the illicit drugs.

         <title>Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophanes by Bioinspired Peptide&#8208;Iminophosphorane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of biomimetic peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane superbases were developed and successfully applied to the construction of [2.2]paracyclophanes with planar chirality. In this way, a series of functionalized, pseudo&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes were synthesized with high enantioselectivity. In further experimental studies, the detailed reaction mechanism underlying this organosuperbase&#8208;catalyzed process was elucidated.







Abstract
Planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes, particularly pseudo&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, are privileged scaffolds for chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis and have widespread applications in materials science. However, catalytic asymmetric approaches for the enantioselective synthesis of pseudo&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel class of peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane organosuperbases to induce planar chirality in spatially stacked [2.2]paracyclophanes. This efficient protocol enables the enantioselective synthesis of a diverse array of structurally distinct pseudo&#8208;gem, pseudo&#8208;ortho, and pseudo&#8208;para [2.2]paracyclophanes, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities via desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. Moreover, the products can be readily diversified through various functional group transformations. Mechanistic investigations provide valuable insights into the unique stereocontrol exhibited by this peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane catalytic system.

         <title>Higher Contrast in 1H&#8208;Observed NMR Ligand Screening with the PEARLScreen Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR screening experiment is introduced, which provides superior binding sensitivity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches: the PEARLScreen. Its sensitivity gain enables a reduction of the protein concentration in mixture screens by up to 20&#8208;fold and renders it the experiment of choice for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening campaigns.







Abstract
For initial hit identification in fragment&#8208;based drug design, NMR is one of the preferred methods, with the well&#8208;established ligand screening experiments T1&#961;, waterLOGSY and STD. Here, we present a new, perfect echo&#8208;based experiment with superior binding sensitivity, the PEARLScreen. The sensitivity enhancement is based on longer relaxation delays as well as active exchange broadening, enabled by the perfect echo scheme. This allowed a reduction of the protein concentration by up to one order of magnitude in comparison to the conventional experiments on the same screening setup without losing binding sensitivity. The experiment was tested throughout the whole field range of commercially available spectrometers from 80 to 1200&#8197;MHz, where at the highest field even a reduction of the required protein amount by a factor of 40 is within reach, thanks to larger compound mixtures and enhanced exchange effects. Based on the superior performance already on standard NMR setups, we expect the PEARLScreen to become the standard screening experiment for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening.

         <title>Gold Self&#8208;Assembly on Copper Electrodes Promotes n&#8208;Propanol Formation in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>

Selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to n&#8208;propanol (29&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) using a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst designed via self&#8208;assembled monolayers for precise surface engineering.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. Among multi&#8208;carbon products, n&#8208;propanol is particularly appealing due to its high energy density (~27 MJ/L) and broad industrial applications. However, achieving high selectivity for n&#8208;propanol remains a formidable challenge, requiring catalysts capable of facilitating complex reaction pathways and avoiding competing side reactions. In this study, we present a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst architecture that is prepared through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) that significantly enhances the Faradaic efficiency for n&#8208;propanol production. Specifically, Cu substrates are modified with cysteamine SAMs to uniformly anchor a Au3+&#8208;dimercaptosuccinate complex, which enable uniform Au electrodeposition. The resulting Cu/Cys/Au electrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 29.1&#8201;% for n&#8208;propanol at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, representing a significant improvement over conventional Au&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts. Control studies reveal the necessity of both Au and Cu for selective n&#8208;propanol formation, while mixed SAMs with varying cysteamine and propanethiol ratios allow for precise tuning of Au coverage on Cu. These findings underscore the potential of SAM&#8208;based strategies for precise surface engineering, offering a pathway for selective CO2RR electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Selective electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to n-propanol (29&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) using a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst designed via self-assembled monolayers for precise surface engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) offers a promising route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable chemicals. Among multi-carbon products, n-propanol is particularly appealing due to its high energy density (~27 MJ/L) and broad industrial applications. However, achieving high selectivity for n-propanol remains a formidable challenge, requiring catalysts capable of facilitating complex reaction pathways and avoiding competing side reactions. In this study, we present a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst architecture that is prepared through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) that significantly enhances the Faradaic efficiency for n-propanol production. Specifically, Cu substrates are modified with cysteamine SAMs to uniformly anchor a Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-dimercaptosuccinate complex, which enable uniform Au electrodeposition. The resulting Cu/Cys/Au electrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 29.1&#8201;% for n-propanol at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, representing a significant improvement over conventional Au&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts. Control studies reveal the necessity of both Au and Cu for selective n-propanol formation, while mixed SAMs with varying cysteamine and propanethiol ratios allow for precise tuning of Au coverage on Cu. These findings underscore the potential of SAM-based strategies for precise surface engineering, offering a pathway for selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Wide Band Gap Germanate with the Largest Second Harmonic Generation Response Created by Hypoxic Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KDP, 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical material is one of the core components for modern laser equipment. The second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and optical band gap are two key indicators of such materials. Herein, a wide band gap germanate, Li3(OH)PbGeO4, with the largest SHG intensity has been created successfully by hypoxic strategy via traditional hydrothermal reactions. The cations in this structure all coordinate with oxygen anions at their lowest coordination number, forming polar PbO3 triangular pyramid and noncentrosymmetric GeO4, LiO4 tetrahedrons. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Structural analysis and PAWED calculations indicate that its strong SHG response is due to the synergistic effects from PbO3, GeO4 and LiO4 groups. Furthermore, Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93. Our work not only breaks the record of SHG intensity in germanates but also provides an effective strategy in exploring new inorganic optical functional crystals.

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Derived Halogen Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;derived halogen bond donors show much improved performance in anion binding and in organocatalysis compared to established neutral halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids like polyfluorinated terphenyls. This superior activity is most clearly demonstrated in the catalysis of a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction.







Abstract
Multidentate neutral halogen bonding catalysts based on iodinated icosahedral ortho&#8208;carborane moieties are introduced. Co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;studies, calorimetric measurements, and 1H NMR titrations demonstrate their strong binding to halides and neutral compounds, further underlined by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Thus, their superior Lewis acidity compared to traditional perfluorinated halogen&#8208;bond donors has been shown. The iodocarborane catalysts also outperformed the latter in a halide abstraction reaction and catalyzed a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction, which was previously out of reach for neutral halogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Hydrodisulfuration of Alkenes with Dithiosulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the versatility of dithiosulfonate reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrodisulfuration of alkenes. Salen&#8208;cobalt enables Markovnikov selectivity, while Ni/N&#8208;donor ligand promotes anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Ni/ligand control achieves remote site&#8208;selectivity via chain walking. Mechanistic studies, supported by experiments and DFT, highlight the key roles of dithiosulfonate radical anion and Ni(III)&#8208;SSR intermediate.







Abstract
In this study, we have discovered the versatility of the dithiosulfonate reagent (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) in transition metal catalyzed selective hydrodisulfuration of unactivated alkenes. The hydrodisulfuration displays a unique Markovnikov selectivity with a Salen&#8208;cobalt complex, while an anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity is observed when employing a nickel/bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand. Furthermore, precise control over nickel/ligand enables the successful achievement of remote site&#8208;selective hydrodisulfuration for both internal and terminal alkenes via a chain&#8208;walking process. In these processes, silanes are employed as a hydride source. Mechanistic insights into these innovative catalytic systems are also elucidated. Experimental findings suggest that Markovnikov hydrodisulfuration is likely to proceed through radical substitution on dithiosulfonate reagents, while nickel catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity and remote site&#8208;selectivity likely occur via the radical addition of the reductively formed dithiosulfonate radical anion ([ArSO2&#8208;SSR]&#8901;&#8722;) to alkyl Ni(II) species (alkyl&#8208;Ni(II)LnX) and subsequent reductive elimination on Ni(III) intermediate (alkyl&#8211;Ni(III)Ln(X)&#8208;SSR) as the key steps based on DFT calculation analysis.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Mass Discovery and High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Fluoroether&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Stability Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning (ML)&#8208;driven workflow was developed for electrolyte screening from vast chemical space through the fast assessment of the high&#8208;voltage stability of electrolytes, solvation ability of solvents to dissolve lithium salts and synthesizability of solvents. Among the recommended candidates, two solvents were synthesized and tested for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMB) application.







Abstract
Developing novel fluoroether electrolytes with high&#8208;voltage stability is an effective strategy to improve the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, the vast chemical space of fluoroether is underexplored due to the absence of effective tools to evaluate the potential used in high&#8208;voltage LMB. Herein, a framework was developed in combination of Voting ensemble algorithms and graph convolution neural network (GCNN), allowing the fast assessment of oxidative stability of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, synthesizability of solvents as well as the solvation ability of them to dissolve lithium salts. Potential fluoroether solvent candidates for high&#8208;voltage LMB were screened out from a virtual library comprising 5576 electrolytes constructed by a combination of 1510 solvents and 4 salts. Among them, two fluorinated ethers, 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) propane and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3,12&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5,10,13&#8208;tetraoxatetradecane, were successfully synthesized and showed satisfactory high&#8208;voltage stability, sufficient solvation ability and satisfactory cycling with almost 99.5&#8201;% coulombic efficiency in Li||NMC811 full cell. This work provided an efficient framework for the discovery of solvents with high&#8208;voltage tolerance in a vast structural space prior to experimental synthesis, accelerating the development of advanced electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

Among them, two fluorinated ethers, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-(2-methoxyethoxy) propane and 7,7,8,8-tetrafluoro-3,12-dimethoxy-2,5,10,13-tetraoxatetradecane, were successfully synthesized and showed satisfactory high-voltage stability, sufficient solvation ability and satisfactory cycling with almost 99.5&#8201;% coulombic efficiency in Li||NMC811 full cell. This work provided an efficient framework for the discovery of solvents with high-voltage tolerance in a vast structural space prior to experimental synthesis, accelerating the development of advanced electrolyte for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Residual Monomer&#8208;Induced Side Reactions in Gel Polymer Electrolytes: Unveiled High&#8208;Ni Cathode Failure in Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers the side reaction mechanism and impact of residual monomers in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with systematically controlled unreacted monomer content under different thermal curing (TC) times. Unreacted monomers in GPEs undergo oxidative decomposition during the initial formation process, inducing organic&#8208;rich interphase reconstruction at NCM interfaces, hindering diffusion kinetics and accelerating degradation chemistry.







Abstract
Coupling gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high&#8208;Ni cathodes (NCM) has emerged as a compelling approach for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, capable of circumventing NCM failure modes in liquid electrolytes. However, a detailed origin of capacity decay caused by residual monomers from an uncontrollable curing process has been largely ignored. Here, we report an in&#8208;depth investigation into the side reactions of unreacted monomers within typical GPEs at the NCM cathode interfaces by utilizing multiscale spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. We evaluate conversion rate&#8208;interphase structure correlation, revealing that interfacial evolution is highly dependent on residual monomer content. Specifically, the degradation chemistry in NCM cathodes with thermally cured gel polymer electrolytes (TC&#8208;GPEs) is governed by monomer&#8208;initiated interphase reconstruction, leading to an imbalanced interphase growth mode with organic&#8208;rich species and retarded diffusion kinetics through the electrode. We further reveal that organic ether/ester&#8208;based byproducts, caused by the oxidative decomposition of unreacted monomers during the initial charging step, are the key factor in the acceleration of NCM failure modes. This study elucidates the multiscale fading mechanism in the NCM||GPE system, providing improved insights into interphase issues in typical GPEs and facilitating the further development of long&#8208;life NCM||GPE prototypes for commercial applications.

         <title>Capturing the Progressive Conformational Evolutions of Sterically&#8208;Congested Dihydrophenazines via Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar conformational evolutions of sterically congested dihydrophenazines were successfully captured by freezing distinct conformations in various crystalline forms. This provided direct structural evidence for understanding the photoinduced structural planarization of the polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with a central cyclic 8&#960;&#8208;electron ring.







Abstract
To gain a deeper understanding of the sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolutions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) luminophores, we strategically freeze distinct conformations by crystallization, allowing to capture the progressive conformational transformations within a DPAC&#8208;based framework by utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Our focus lies in the innovative modification of DPAC via the synthesis of cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted derivatives DPAC&#8208;nCN (n=1&#8211;4, with n indicating the number of CN groups). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing CN groups modulates electron delocalization and lowers energy barriers, facilitating access to conformational polymorphism within the crystals. Unlike the limited diversity observed in the crystallization behaviour of DPAC, the DPAC&#8208;2CN to DPAC&#8208;4CN derivatives exhibit distinct crystalline forms, with conformational diversity increasing in tandem with the number of CN substituents. Notably, the single DPAC&#8208;4CN molecule features multi&#8208;colored crystals transitioning from blue to red, with the folding angle of the polycyclic dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine ring progressive varying from ~130&#176; to ~172&#176;. Additionally, DPAC&#8208;4CN&#8217;s red crystals with high&#8208;energy planar conformation (~172&#176;) can experience a sudden jumping when subjected to stimuli. This study not only advances the understanding of conformational dynamics in dihydrophenazines but also paves a new way for the development of dynamic crystal materials.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Synergism&#8208;Enhanced Liquid Metal Locomotion for Unrestricted Circuit Substrate Patterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal is demonstrated, incubating the method for efficiently and precisely patterning liquid metal over a broad range of substrates, where the gallium redox states&#8208;mediated synergistic electrochemical energy transduction drives the enhanced liquid metal locomotion behaviour.







Abstract
The critical challenge in advancing liquid metal circuits (LMCs) lies in achieving interfacial compatibility with diverse substrates while dynamically balancing fabrication efficiency and quality to ensure robust conductive stability. Here we introduce an electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal (E&#8208;rsLM) that enables the controllable generation of diverse intermetallic bond transition layers (Cu, Au, or Fe&#8208;based) between liquid metal and unrestricted substrate surfaces, applicable in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. It involves enhanced locomotion of the liquid metal, driven by synergistic electrochemical energy transduction from cyclic changes in gallium redox states. Characterized by expansion&#8208;contraction&#8208;expansion, it enables unique self&#8208;propelled bouncing, tuning spreading speed (up to ~26.8&#8197;mm/s) and elongation rate (up to 1192&#8201;%) with a volume of only 80&#8197;&#956;L. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of E&#8208;rsLM fabrication across 30 different substrates, highlighting its versatility. The patterning displays the superimposed efficiency and self&#8208;indicated quality, leading to superior conductivity (with time&#8208;cost savings of 30.7&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;% in heating&#8208;cooling cycles, and a nearly 90&#8201;% reduction in output resistance). The practical viability of these circuits is further showcased by the assembly of integrated circuits, marking a significant step in expanding LMCs applications beyond laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photoredox Catalysis toward Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of phenazine&#8208;based 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different substituent groups were constructed. The interpenetration folds and energy levels of these COFs can be well regulated. Upon irradiation with visible light, these COFs can work as efficient photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high recyclability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a thriving class of photocatalysts in various chemical transformations. However, the utilization of COFs as photoredox catalysts for atom transfer radical polymerization is rarely known. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of phenazine&#8208;based functional 3D COFs with the dia topology. Structural regulation over interpenetration folds and energy levels of COFs was implemented through the substituent effects. These COFs can work as effective photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization. Notably, DADP&#8208;CF3&#8208;COF with trifluoromethyl group exhibits much higher catalytic activity than other COFs, allowing the efficient synthesis of polymers with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high conversion. This work not merely realizes the structural regulation of 3D COFs through substituent effects, but also exhibits brilliant prospects for the utilization of COFs as efficient catalysts in a bunch of challenging chemical transformations.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Ketocarbonyl Compounds with Simple Olefins by Photoredox&#8208;Nickel&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer Triple Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel approach involving photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds with simple olefins has been developed. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route to enantioselectively synthesize high&#8208;value molecules featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter from feedstock chemicals, while only consuming photons.







Abstract
Although the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of carbonyl compounds with activated olefins has already been established, extending this methodology to less activated or nonactivated olefins remains a significant challenge due to the polarity mismatch in these ionic processes. An alternative approach involves the activation of the parent carbonyl compounds into electrophilic &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, which could potentially overcome this limitation. However, the lack of efficient catalytic systems has impeded the wide adoption of this strategy, particularly in realm of the catalytic asymmetric reactions. Here, we present a cooperative triple catalytic system that integrates photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts to achieve a direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds using simple olefins as alkylating agents. By combining a multifunctional chiral nickel Lewis acid with an iridium photoredox catalyst and a thiophenol catalyst under visible light, we have developed a highly efficient process that is temporally synchronized to facilitate a novel mechanism of electron and hydrogen transfer. This triple catalytic approach enables the intermolecular coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds with both less and non&#8208;activated olefins. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route to enantioselectively synthesize high&#8208;value molecules featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter from feedstock chemicals, while only consuming photons.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational isomerization of the Se&#8208;based donors in a pair of enantiomers has led to multi&#8208;emission of blue, yellow and red phosphorescence. The enantiomers thus showed single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPL) and also exhibited white circularly polarized electroluminescence in white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a color rendering index (CRI) of 82 at CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33).







Abstract
A pair of multi&#8208;emission enantiomers, (R)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ and (S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ, was designed and synthesized by integrating Se&#8208;induced conformationally isomeric donors with a chiral carbonyl&#8208;containing acceptor into a unified molecular framework. The enantiomers showed white emission with blue, yellow and red multi&#8208;emission bands in solution and film at CIE coordinates of (0.39, 0.35) and (0.33, 0.34), respectively. Doped film of the enantiomers achieved a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 42&#8201;%, accompanied by mirror&#8208;image white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPPL) signals with a |gPL| value of 2.6&#215;10&#8722;3. Moreover, the enantiomers also showed white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33) and EQEmax of 3.1&#8201;%. Notably, this work represents the first single&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;emission WCPL materials and achieved the highest performance for white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule organic materials with phosphorescent properties. Furthermore, leveraging Bragg reflection from dual&#8208;layer cholesteric liquid crystals, the enantiomers achieved |gPL| and |gEL| values of 1.85 and 1.88, respectively, marking the highest reported values for WCPPL and WCPEL to date.

         <title>Facilitating OH* Generation on Atomic Pd&#8211;Cu Dual Sites towards Efficient Glycerol Electrooxidation to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;doped Cu3N hollow nanocubes with Pd&#8208;Cu dual sites were prepared, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance for glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Pd atoms located in partial Cu substituent sites facilitate the generation of active *OH and enhance the adsorption of glycerol on adjacent Cu sites, while Pd atoms located in Cu3N unit center could reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C bond cleavage for the rate determining step.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) represents a mild and sustainable pathway to produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as formate. However, the rational design and controlled synthesis of efficient catalysts to achieve highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of glycerol towards formate remains a great challenge. Herein, atomic Pd doped Cu3N hollow nanocubes with Pd&#8722;Cu dual sites were prepared via the unique Kirkendall process, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic GOR activity and selectivity towards formate with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 91.6&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms located in partial Cu substituent sites could facilitate the generation of active *OH and enhance the adsorption of glycerol molecule on adjacent Cu sites, while Pd atoms located in Cu3N unit center could effectively reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C bond cleavage for the rate determining step. Our work provides new insights into the development of well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;site catalysts to boost glycerol electrooxidation to formate.

         <title>Breaking the Limitation of Laminar Flow in Thrombolytic Therapy with Reconfigurable Vortex&#8208;Like Nanobot Swarms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the control of RMF, the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms move along the blood vessel wall toward the venous thrombus, disrupting the laminar flow near the thrombus. The released urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA) is then entrained by the rotating fluid induced by the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms, where it directly acts on the thrombus.







Abstract
Laminar blood flow represents the normal physiological state of blood circulation, but it also acts as a natural physiological barrier for the effective diffusion of drugs to the lesion site. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy in which reconfigurable vortex&#8208;like swarms of magnetic swimming nanobots actively disrupt the laminar flow to deliver drugs in a manner similar to how bacteria seek food. The drug was released from the cavity of biodegradable, submicron pentosan flask&#8208;like nanobots, aggregates as the dynamic rotating drug fluid under a rotating magnetic field. The vortex&#8208;like nanobot swarm successfully overcame the laminar barrier near the thrombus in a rat inferior vena cava stenosis thrombosis model, which was observed by ultrasound blood flow imaging. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of nanobots swarm for enhancing thrombolytic efficacy through drug aggregation after breaking the laminar flow was further confirmed in a rat deep vein thrombosis model. This bionic active targeting approach overcomes the laminar flow barrier and restricts the release of drugs by the swarm&#8208;induced vortex fluid to facilitate targeted drug delivery, which is expected to be an innovative method to enhance drug delivery efficiency.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#963;&#8208;&#960; Hyperconjugation gives the covalent organic good solid fluorescence performance, and its electron cloud shape is like a lotus flower. High&#8208;quality solid fluorescence can be used for sound sensor parts. TOC Figure is obtained by combining the Chinese classical lifted lotus flower and the flying sky of playing flute.







Abstract
Realizing efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represents a persistent and fundamental challenge in materials science, hindering their application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. Herein, a transformative strategy leveraging &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation is introduced to enhance the fluorescence properties of COFs. The incorporation of a methyl group into a pyrene&#8208;based COF monomer yields an unprecedented fluorescence quantum yield increase of more than 100&#8208;fold, accompanied by significantly enhanced optoelectronic performance. This enhancement arises from &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation, which redistributes electron density, converting pyrene from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and facilitating efficient electronic transitions. Additionally, a COF&#8208;based fluorescent acoustic sensor, fabricated via electrospinning, demonstrates real&#8208;time speech pattern recognition when integrated with machine learning algorithms, showcasing potential in language&#8208;assistive technologies.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Lithium and Sodium Conducting Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the first example of ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs) crosslinked by aliphatic spiroborate linkages. These ICANs are straightforward to synthesize and exhibit promising ion conductivity at elevated temperature. Moreover, these materials are closed&#8208;loop recyclable and rapidly reprocessable. Their potential application as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated through the fabrication of a prototype device.







Abstract
Within the past two decades, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have emerged as a novel class of dynamically crosslinked polymers, combining the benefits of thermosets and thermoplastics. Although some CANs with charged side chains have been reported, CANs with negatively charged backbones remain very limited. The integration of permanent charge into the backbones upon their formation could open up important new applications. Here, we introduce a series of aliphatic spiroborate&#8208;linked ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs), representing a new category of dynamic ionomer thermosets. These ICANs were synthesized using a catalyst&#8208;free, scalable, and environment&#8208;friendly method. Incorporating lithium or sodium as counter cations in these networks yielded promising ion conductivity without the need of plasticizers. The dynamic nature of the spiroborate linkages in these materials allows for rapid reprocessing and recycling under moderate conditions. Furthermore, their potential as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated in a device that maintained robust conducting performance under extreme physical deformation, coupled with effective self&#8208;healing properties. This research opens new possibilities for future development of dynamic ionomer thermosets and their potential applications in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Reinventing the High&#8208;rate Energy Storage of Hard Carbon: the Order&#8208;degree Governs the Trade&#8208;off of Desolvation&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Interphase at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrode/electrolyte interface processes involve two key steps: ion desolvation and ion transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the determining factor of which one affects the performance of hard carbon is limited by the microstructure of the hard carbon. In a more disordered state, solvation and SEI work in concert; however, as the degree of order increases, the role of the solvation structure becomes more pronounced than that of the SEI.







Abstract
In alkali metal&#8208;ion battery systems, the electrolyte enables being decomposed on the electrode surface to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. In principle, a thin, uniform SEI film facilitates the enhancement of the performance of the cell. Herein, we successfully distinguish the effects of desolvation behavior and SEI process on the kinetic behavior of hard carbon (HC) electrodes by adopting the strategy of switching the electrolyte interface model to modulate the properties of SEI film. Our findings reveal that although the SEI film is generally responsible for significantly affecting the HC's capacity, the equally crucial desolvation process must not be overlooked. The trade&#8208;off between the two factors is found to be determined by the structural features of HCs. Specifically, in the context of a more ordered HC, the desolvation of ions emerges as the rate&#8208;limiting step for Na+ transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface, exerting a more pronounced effect rather than the SEI. Thus, a close correlation was established between the SEI, solvation structure effects, hard carbon structure, and electrode performance. This linkage is thereof fundamental for the strategic design of electrolytes and the targeted enhancement of cell performance.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Agent for Synergistic Tumor Therapy: Co&#8208;Activation of Photochemical&#8208;Biological Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic composite nanotherapeutic agent (HAP@BMPns) was developed for synergistic tumor therapy. HAP@BMPns is triggered by the acidic tumor environment to release the photosensitizer BMP and Ca2+, thereby synergistically activating photochemical&#8208;biological effects through the production of O2&#8722;&#8901; based Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions and mitochondrial damage caused by Ca2+ overload, ultimately achieving a synergistic effect for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;mode photodynamic therapy (PDT) based on photochemical reactions is limited by the tumor microenvironment, which reduces the ablation efficiency for solid tumors. Making it vital to seek ways to improve the tumor therapeutic effect. Based on this, we propose a dual&#8208;mode intelligent nanotherapeutic system (HAP@BMPns) based on photochemical&#8208;biological effects. HAP@BMPns is composed of an acid&#8208;responsive high&#8208;calcium biomimetic nanomaterial (HAP) and photosensitizer (BMP), which can spontaneously activate photochemical (Type&#8208;I PDT) and biological effects for synergistic cancer therapy. HAP@BMPns breaks down upon entering tumor cells under acidic conditions, releasing a large amount of Ca2+ and BMP. Triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, which induces mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis. Synchronously, Type&#8208;I PDT of BMP under two&#8208;photon (800&#8197;nm) laser irradiation becomes activated, resulting in enhanced destruction of tumor cells by the photochemical effect. Cell studies have indicated that HAP@BMPns (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) exhibits a strong inhibitory efficiency on tumor cells growth, with low (22.4&#8201;%) survival rate. However, the individual components, i.&#8201;e. BMP (5.0&#8197;&#956;M) and HAP (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) display low inhibitory efficiency with high survival rates (55.9&#8201;% and 63.0&#8201;% respectively). Therefore, this dual&#8208;mode synergistic treatment strategy using acid&#8208;triggered photochemical&#8208;biological effects significantly enhances the ablation of solid tumors, realizing the synergistic effect. We hope that this design strategy can provide guidance for the design and development of a tumor therapeutic platform.

         <title>Enhanced Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Prolonged Cycling Stability of Aluminum&#8208;Selenium Batteries Using Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte prepared via diluting the ionic liquid electrolyte with non&#8208;solvating 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzene co&#8208;solvent facilitates the deposition of Emim+ and Al&#8722;Cl species for the formation of a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Al&#8722;Se batteries. This prevents the dissolution of poly&#8208;selenides and their deposition on Al metal anode, ultimately enhancing the cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Al&#8722;Se batteries (ASeBs) with high theoretical specific capacity and discharge voltage are promising energy storage devices. However, the detrimental shuttle effect occurring in conventional ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) challenges their development. Herein, a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is constructed via employing locally concentrated IL electrolytes (LCILEs) to overcome these issues. It is demonstrated that LCILEs facilitate the incorporation of Emim+ into the electrode/electrolyte interphases, and, meanwhile, more Al&#8722;Cl species deposits are observed in the CEI. The formed CEI effectively prevents the dissolution of poly&#8208;selenides, inhibiting their related parasitic reactions. These result in ASeBs, employing the LCILE, to deliver a specific discharge capacity of 218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while the cell using the neat ILE only maintains 38&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the same conditions. Moreover, an Al&#8722;S cell operated in LCILEs reaches 578&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles, which is also significantly better than 317&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the neat ILE. This study provides an LCILE&#8208;based strategy to reinforce the CEI in order to suppress the shuttle effect, realizing Al&#8208;chalcogen batteries with better performance.

This prevents the dissolution of poly-selenides and their deposition on Al metal anode, ultimately enhancing the cyclability of the batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al&#8722;Se batteries (ASeBs) with high theoretical specific capacity and discharge voltage are promising energy storage devices. However, the detrimental shuttle effect occurring in conventional ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) challenges their development. Herein, a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is constructed via employing locally concentrated IL electrolytes (LCILEs) to overcome these issues. It is demonstrated that LCILEs facilitate the incorporation of Emim&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the electrode/electrolyte interphases, and, meanwhile, more Al&#8722;Cl species deposits are observed in the CEI. The formed CEI effectively prevents the dissolution of poly-selenides, inhibiting their related parasitic reactions. These result in ASeBs, employing the LCILE, to deliver a specific discharge capacity of 218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while the cell using the neat ILE only maintains 38&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under the same conditions. Moreover, an Al&#8722;S cell operated in LCILEs reaches 578&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 150 cycles, which is also significantly better than 317&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the neat ILE. This study provides an LCILE-based strategy to reinforce the CEI in order to suppress the shuttle effect, realizing Al-chalcogen batteries with better performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with a Boron&#8208;Doped Zigzag/Armchair Topology: A Boron&#8208;Edging Strategy for Organic Narrowband Emitters</title>

Aiming at challenging boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), three large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology were synthesized. The as&#8208;obtained molecules show intriguing topological and electronic structures as well as optoelectronic properties, e.g. inhibited excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and narrowband emission characteristics.







Abstract
Control over molecular topologies and/or heteroatom doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their electronic structures and achieve desirable physical properties. Herein, this work challenges boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended PAHs. We successfully synthesized a series of large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology through one&#8208;pot multifold Scholl cyclization reaction. Two of them possess the desired C3&#8208;symmetric and unexpected unsymmetrical C54B3 nanographene frameworks, respectively, thus illustrating triply boron&#8208;edging manipulations of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Detailed studies reveal that such boron&#8208;doped edge topology significantly inhibits their excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and thereby produces narrowband emission characteristics. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of their fluorescence spectra are as small as 12&#8211;18&#8197;nm, which have never been observed for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and are among the smallest values reported for organic emitters. Their solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) display extremely narrowband electroluminescence, and additionally, the obtained FWHM of only 23&#8197;nm represents the narrowest one reported for red OLEDs.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy to Transform Cationic Polymers for Efficient and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy was used to transform low&#8208;cost and ineffective cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), which robustly delivered mRNA to the spleen in vivo. PAPs loaded with mRNA encoding model antigen could induce robust anti&#8208;tumor response, suggesting their great potential for vaccine application. Additionally, by incorporating different helper lipids, PAP&#8208;based four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) specifically delivered mRNA to the lung and liver, respectively. This strategy advances both the polymer&#8208; and lipid&#8208;based mRNA delivery systems.







Abstract
The progress of mRNA therapeutics underscores the imperative demand for the development of targeted delivery systems. While cationic polymers hold promise as genetic vectors, their poor in vivo efficacy and numerous variants highlight the urgent need for a universal functionalization strategy to bolster their delivery capabilities. Here, we present a versatile strategy to transform low&#8208;cost commercial cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), enabling efficient and organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery in vivo. This straightforward post&#8208;functionalization method can be readily broadened to a diverse array of existing cationic polymers, enhancing their cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release functionalities. Consequently, PAPs facilitate up to 30,500&#8208;fold higher mRNA expression compared to their unmodified counterparts in vivo. Notably, the one&#8208;component PAPs enable spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery, with their vaccine application validated in a mouse melanoma model following intravenous administration. Better still, PAPs can synergize with different helper lipids to formulate four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), achieving respective lung&#8208; and liver&#8208;specific mRNA delivery. Noteworthy is that these organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery systems significantly outperform previous polymer and LNP benchmarks. This transformation strategy for cationic polymers represents a generalized methodology to give highly effective mRNA carriers, highlighting substantial potential for clinical translation of mRNA therapies with organ&#8208;targeting requirements.

A unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) is designed to enable stable cycling of micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes in subzero environments. Through elaborate regulation of competitive coordination, the TIWSE preserves a temperature&#8208;independent anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and exhibits weak solvent coordination, enhancing the capacity retention and rate capability of &#956;Si anodes. This work addresses low&#8208;temperature challenges of high&#8208;energy &#956;Si||Ni&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes with high specific capacity are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but face significant volume changes during cycling. Constructing anion&#8208;derived, inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by electrolyte engineering is considered a viable strategy for stabilizing &#956;Si anodes. However, at low temperatures, temperature&#8208;dependent anion&#8208;dominated solvation and sluggish Li+ desolvation hinder cyclability and capacity retention. Here we introduce a unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) that preserves the anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and has weak solvent coordination capability, enabling stable cycling of &#956;Si anodes in subzero environments. The crucial role of NO3&#8722; anions with a high donor number in regulating competitive coordination in TIWSE is unveiled. As a result, &#956;Si||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with TIWSE demonstrate impressive capacity retention of 91.8&#8201;% at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 80.8&#8201;% at 30&#8201;&#176;C after 100 cycles, along with a high specific capacity of 137.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C. Furthermore, a 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell of Si&#8722;C||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 shows remarkable cycling stability with 89.3&#8201;% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 77.3&#8201;% retention at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating the practical applicability. This work highlights the importance of solvation chemistry in addressing low&#8208;temperature challenges and offers new insights into high&#8208;energy &#956;Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating under harsh conditions.

An oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr single&#8208;atom catalyst with excellent oxygen reduction activity and proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance has been discovered for the first time.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) are promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Their ORR activity and selectivity are significantly affected by the heteroatoms that coordinate the central metal atoms. Previous reports found that oxygen&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs promoted a 2e&#8722; ORR rather than the 4e&#8722; ORR that is more desirable for fuel cells. Herein, we report for the first time that oxygen&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs are capable of promoting the 4e&#8722; ORR in acid media. We prepared a Cr(acac)&#8208;NC catalyst with the central Cr atom coordinated by two O atoms. The Cr(acac)&#8208;NC catalyst not only exhibits excellent ORR activity and stability in acid media, but also delivers high proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance comparable to N&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Cr&#8722;O2 moieties located on the zigzag edge of the carbon support are the ORR&#8208;active sites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-supported metal single-atom catalysts (M-SACs) are promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Their ORR activity and selectivity are significantly affected by the heteroatoms that coordinate the central metal atoms. Previous reports found that oxygen-coordinated M-SACs promoted a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR rather than the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR that is more desirable for fuel cells. Herein, we report for the first time that oxygen-coordinated M-SACs are capable of promoting the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR in acid media. We prepared a Cr(acac)-NC catalyst with the central Cr atom coordinated by two O atoms. The Cr(acac)-NC catalyst not only exhibits excellent ORR activity and stability in acid media, but also delivers high proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance comparable to N-coordinated M-SACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Cr&#8722;O2 moieties located on the zigzag edge of the carbon support are the ORR-active sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;resistant organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials are achieved by fabricating the microphase separation structure in block copolymers via synergizing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases. After the self&#8208;assembly, the hydrophilic blocks were surrounded by hydrophobic blocks to mitigate water ingress. The resulting copolymers exhibit a long phosphorescent lifetime and decent water&#8208;resistant properties, demonstrating potential applications in afterglow display and information encryption.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have demonstrated significant potential for various applications due to their unique luminescent properties. However, most conventional RTP polymers are vulnerable to moisture and water, which can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network within the polymer and accelerate the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons of phosphors, leading to the quenching of RTP. Herein, we present a universal strategy to achieve water&#8208;resistant RTP polymers by designing amphiphilic block copolymers with microphase&#8208;separated structures. Specifically, the rigid hydrophilic phase, which is rich in carboxyl groups, forms hydrogen bonds that suppress non&#8208;radiative decay of the chromophores, resulting in RTP. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic phase effectively prevents water molecules from penetrating and disrupting the rigid polymer network. By combining the functions of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases, the resulting RTP copolymers exhibit good water&#8208;resistant properties. Even after being immersed in water for one month, the copolymers maintain a green afterglow with a lifetime of 629&#8197;ms. Moreover, the water&#8208;resistant nature of these RTP polymers has also been demonstrated in potential applications of afterglow displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This research offers valuable insights into the design of RTP materials with stability in aqueous environments and broadens the scope of their potential applications in diverse settings.

         <title>Defect Imide Double Antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi) as Potential Solar Cell Absorber Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonothermal method enabled the synthesis of antiperovskites with NH2&#8722;&#8208;groups instead of N3&#8722;&#8208; ions, which introduces vacancies and replaces the octahedral unit by square&#8208;pyramidal units. These imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi) showcase a new route to structurally engineer antiperovskites with cation&#8208;deficiencies. Their direct band gaps have been confirmed and density functional theory calculations revealed good band dispersion, transport properties and optical properties suitable for solar cell absorber materials.







Abstract
An abundance of oxide, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have been explored, demonstrating outstanding properties, while the emerging nitride perovskites are extremely rare due to their challenging synthesis requirements. By inverting the ion type in the perovskite structure, the corresponding antiperovskite structure is obtained. Among them, ternary antiperovskite nitrides X3AN (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg; A=As, Sb) have recently been identified as exhibiting excellent optoelectronic properties. To explore the unrealized composition space of nitride perovskites, the ammonothermal method was applied, yielding three new layered quaternary imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites, namely AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi). These new compounds feature distorted square&#8208;pyramidal coordination around the imide&#8208;group (Ca5NH). Layers with Ca2+ vacancies are found with an alternating As3&#8722; and Pn3&#8722; (Pn3&#8722;=Sb3&#8722;, Bi3&#8722;) coordination along the A&#8208;site, forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure. All three AE5AsPn(NH)2 compounds show suitable direct band gaps within the visible light spectrum. Density functional theory calculations reveal favorable band dispersion, as well as transport and optical properties, especially along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, demonstrating their 3D character of electronic transport. The narrow tunable direct band gaps and favorable charge carrier properties make AE5AsPn(NH)2 promising candidates for solar cell absorber materials.

         <title>Improving Light&#8208;Responsive Efficiency of Type II Porous Liquid by Tailoring the Functionality of Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is designed to fabricate type II light&#8208;responsive porous liquid (LPL) with enhanced responsive efficiency by tailoring the functionality of host with long&#8208;chain alkyl ligand in addition to responsive ligand. The new host is dissolved in a polyethylene glycol&#8208;based ionic liquid, which leads to the production of LPL with controllable gas adsorption behavior and shows potential for propylene/propane separation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive porous liquids (LPLs) attract significant attention for their controllable gas uptake under light irradiation, while their preparation has remained a great challenge. Here we report the fabrication of type II LPLs with enhanced light&#8208;responsive efficiency by tailoring the host's functionality for the first time. The functionality of light&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC&#8208;RL, constructed from dicopper and responsive ligands) is modified by introducing the second long&#8208;chain alkyl ligand, producing MOC&#8208;RL&#8208;AL as a new host. A spatially hindered solvent based on polyethylene glycol, IL&#8208;NTf2, is designed and can dissolve MOC&#8208;RL&#8208;AL due to the suitable interaction, creating a type II LPL (PL&#8208;RL&#8208;AL). Under light irradiation, the variation in propylene adsorption for PL&#8208;RL&#8208;AL increases by 58.0&#8201;% compared to PL&#8208;RL. The enhanced light&#8208;responsive efficiency is caused by easier control in accessibility of internal cavities within MOCs and increased number of external cavities between MOCs and IL&#8208;NTf2. This makes PL&#8208;RL&#8208;AL the first LPL with the probability for propylene/propane separation.

         <title>Dual Defects&#8208;Induced Iron Single Atoms Immobilized in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Hollow BiOBr Microtubes for Low&#8208;Barrier Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual vacancies of oxygen and bromine induce the formation of catalytically active Fe single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated FeO5 configuration in hollow MOF&#8208;derived BiOBr microtubes, which benefits the efficient photocatalytic nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts with precise coordination environment and high separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is critical yet challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic nitrogen reduction. Herein, we design and construct a defective photocatalyst featuring Fe single atoms immobilized in hollow BiOBr microtube using a plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where the Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework is used as sacrificial template. The dual vacancies of oxygen (VO) and bromine (VBr) are created in the BiOBr microtube and induce the formation of coordinatively unsaturated FeO5 configuration, where four oxygen atoms are from [Bi2O2]2+ units and one oxygen atom is located in the VBr. Specially, the hollow catalyst with dual defects and FeO5 moiety exhibits 1.4 and 2.2 times higher ammonia production activity than another two VBr&#8208;featuring catalysts with coordinatively saturated FeO6 configuration and unsaturated FeO4 configuration, respectively. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the optimized catalyst with the FeO5 configuration reduces the energy barrier of electron transfer from Fe 3d orbitals to antibonding orbitals of N2 molecules, which favors the formation of a key *NNH intermediate in the N2 fixation reaction and the resultant efficient ammonia production.

&lt;p&gt;The dual vacancies of oxygen and bromine induce the formation of catalytically active Fe single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated FeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration in hollow MOF-derived BiOBr microtubes, which benefits the efficient photocatalytic nitrogen reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational design of single-atom catalysts with precise coordination environment and high separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is critical yet challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic nitrogen reduction. Herein, we design and construct a defective photocatalyst featuring Fe single atoms immobilized in hollow BiOBr microtube using a plasma-assisted synthesis strategy, where the Bi-based metal&#8211;organic framework is used as sacrificial template. The dual vacancies of oxygen (V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) and bromine (V&lt;sub&gt;Br&lt;/sub&gt;) are created in the BiOBr microtube and induce the formation of coordinatively unsaturated FeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, where four oxygen atoms are from [Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; units and one oxygen atom is located in the V&lt;sub&gt;Br&lt;/sub&gt;. Specially, the hollow catalyst with dual defects and FeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; moiety exhibits 1.4 and 2.2 times higher ammonia production activity than another two V&lt;sub&gt;Br&lt;/sub&gt;-featuring catalysts with coordinatively saturated FeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; configuration and unsaturated FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration, respectively. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the optimized catalyst with the FeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; configuration reduces the energy barrier of electron transfer from Fe 3d orbitals to antibonding orbitals of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, which favors the formation of a key *NNH intermediate in the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation reaction and the resultant efficient ammonia production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Weakening Solvent&#8208;Solute Interactions for High&#8208;Efficiency Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was proposed to weaken the interaction between solvents and perovskite precursors through halogen ions. This leads to the improved efficiency of the optimized screen&#8208;printed device and mini&#8208;module to 21.8&#8201;% (0.05&#8197;cm2) and 18.95&#8201;% (12.6&#8197;cm2), respectively. This work opens a new avenue to improve the performance of screen&#8208;printed PSCs.







Abstract
Screen printing has emerged as a leading candidate for industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics. However, strong solvent&#8208;solute interaction in conventional formulations accelerates the preferential crystallization of perovskites at points, hindering the progressive phase evolution from point to line to plane. In this work, we introduced halogen ions to weaken solvent&#8208;solute interactions, achieving the reduced Pb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O coordination strength counterbalanced by enhanced Pb&#8722;I bonding interactions. This weakened interaction delays formamidinium iodide participation in rapid phase transitions to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide, enabling controlled crystallization kinetics. The optimized screen&#8208;printed perovskite solar cells demonstrate remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 21.8&#8201;% for 0.05&#8197;cm2 devices and 18.95&#8201;% for 5&#8197;cm&#215;5&#8197;cm mini&#8208;modules (active area: 12.60&#8197;cm2). Furthermore, this strategy exhibits broad process compatibility, achieving 23&#8211;24&#8201;% PCEs for both blade&#8208;coating and spin&#8208;coating devices fabricated under ambient conditions (25&#8211;30&#8201;&#176;C, 35&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity). These breakthroughs highlight the universal potential of coordination engineering for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment and Oxygen Electroreduction Reaction Performance Correlationship of Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic polymers with finely tuned linkage microenvironment and Fe&#8208;N4 site electron spin states are prepared to elucidate structure&#8211;property relationships towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Systematic in situ electrochemical and structural characterizations attributed the improved ORR kinetics of the electron&#8208;withdrawing benzophenone substituted catalyst with high&#8208;spin Fe&#8208;N4 moieties to the high accessible site density and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (PFePc) offer well&#8208;defined sites, rendering them ideal model systems to elucidate structure&#8211;property relationships towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but have struggled to achieve improved catalytic activity due to uniform electron distribution of iron center and difficulty in molecular&#8208;level structure design. Although rationally linkage microenvironmental regulation is an effective approach to adjusting activity, the underlying fundamental mechanism is incompletely understood. Herein, systematic DFT calculations and experimental investigation of PFePc analogous reveal that the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing benzophenone linkage into the PFePc backbone (PFePc&#8208;3) drives the delocalization of Fe d&#8208;orbital electrons, downshifts the d&#8208;band energy level, thereby tailoring the key OH* intermediate interaction, demonstrating enhanced ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V, a high mass activity of 21.43&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 2.18&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that linkage regulation can induce a 3d electron with high spin&#8208;state (t2g3eg2) of PFePc&#8208;3, significantly accelerating the ORR kinetics. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry further highlight the rapid kinetics of PFePc&#8208;3 to the high accessible site density (6.14&#215;1019&#8197;site&#8201;g&#8722;1) and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Fluorophores by a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) Coupling Reaction Driven by Charge&#8208;Transfer Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction between the substrates has been developed that can afford mono&#8208; or di&#8208;substituted products depending on the reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal the important role played by the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex in this reaction. The method was used for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse and novel NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.







Abstract
Here, we report a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction. Due to the strong intermolecular noncovalent interaction, an essential electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex is formed, confirmed solidly by absorption spectra, 1H NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The EDA complex lowers the activation barrier (Ea=9.17&#8197;kcal/mol) and facilitates the formation of the C&#8722;C bond, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step revealed by H/D and 12C/13C KIE studies. Kinetic investigations reveal that the reaction is a second&#8208;order reaction. Furthermore, high&#8208;level theoretical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted products were obtained by varying the reaction conditions. A series of structurally diverse and novel second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores based on benzo[1,2&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;c&#8217;]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) were synthesized by utilizing this coupling reaction.

Four Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) with the same main chain but different stacking patterns have been synthesized as models to explore stacking engineering in the conversion of light energy. The zigzag&#8208;stacked COFs were shown to generate self&#8208;built electric field that mutually promotes interchain carrier transport, and introducing appropriate mortise&#8208;tenon structures between the chains enhances this effect and regulates light absorption.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are promising in the field of photonic energy conversion. However, most efforts have been concentrated on the design of ligand geometric structures and chemical bonding relationships, while understanding the impact of stacking methods on photonic energy conversion remains a significant challenge. In this work, four COFs (1D&#8208;COF, 1D&#8208;MeCOF, 1D&#8208;tBuCOF and 2D&#8208;COF) with the same main&#8208;chain structure but different stacking methods are designed and synthesized, using photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as a model reaction. Mortise&#8208;tenon stacked 1D&#8208;MeCOF exhibits far superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance to other stacking methods, and it maintains high efficiency and stability in natural seawater systems. Extensive characterization demonstrates that such a unique mortise&#8208;tenon stacking structure of 1D&#8208;MeCOF inhibits interchain slippage, enhances &#960;&#8208;stacking, and maximizing light absorption capabilities. Furthermore, unidirectional carrier transport characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional structure can generate a strong photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;built electric field, which acts as &#8220;self&#8208;catalysis&#8221; to accelerate carrier transport. This work provides an effective design strategy and mechanistic insights on the stacking engineering of photonic energy conversion materials.

         <title>Crystallization Thermodynamics Regulation of 1.85&#8197;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient and Stable Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>

Wide&#8208;band gap perovskite with high Br content features rapid crystallization, resulting in poor film quality due to the uncontrolled intermediate phases. However, a diammonium salt additive can improve film uniformity and crystallization of perovskite effectively, reducing phase segregation and voltage loss in perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;band gap perovskite with adjustable band gaps can be integrated with organic solar cells to form tandem solar cells (TSCs), thereby surpassing the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, increasing Br content to elevate the band gap above 1.8&#8197;eV complicates crystallization, leading to inferior film quality and defects due to the unmanageable evolution of intermediate phases. Surface passivation improves crystallization but hard to moderate the inhomogeneous component distributions and defects in the bulk phase. Here, we introduce a diammonium salt as an additive to regulate the homogeneity and crystallization of perovskite film, eliminating the low&#8208;dimensional intermediate phase for orientated crystallization of 1.85&#8197;eV perovskite, resulting in efficient wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.379&#8197;V and operational stability remaining 85&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after illumination for 1200&#8197;h. Furthermore, perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.03&#8201;% and a high Voc of 2.108&#8197;V, one of the highest Voc for perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs.

         <title>Synergy from the Stepped Hollow FeHCFe Nanocubes and the Dimorphic Polypyrrole for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Water Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination of hybrid capacitive deionization was realized via synergy from the stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes and the dimorphic polypyrrole (PPy). The FeHCFe/PPy with appropriate component ratio achieved an remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate in both batch&#8208;flow and single&#8208;pass mode, along with excellent cycling performance, outperforming other related materials.







Abstract
Saline water desalination serves as an important route to increase freshwater supply, while capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technique to tackle this issue. To boost the successful application of CDI, development of advanced electrode materials is vital. Herein, we innovatively designed and synthesized a sophisticated Prussian blue/dimorphic polypyrrole composite for the hybrid CDI (HCDI). Specifically, the nanoparticle&#8208;like polypyrrole (PPy) in situ distributed on the surface of stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes, while the coexisting nanotube&#8208;like PPy interconnected the discrete stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes. The introduction of PPy nanoparticles/nanotubes promoted both electron and ion dynamics, and improved the electrochemical activity of FeHCFe. Meanwhile, the FeHCFe nanocubes with concave stepwise architecture on each side offered large accessible contact area for electrolyte, reduced Na+ migration path, improved tolerance for lattice expansion, and optimized redox sites for Na+ storage. Through such unique structural design and synergistic combination, the FeHCFe/PPy with appropriate component ratio achieved a remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate along with excellent cycling performance, outperforming other related materials. Moreover, the treated solution can meet the drinking water standard within 6&#8197;min via the use of six tandem HCDI cells. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the mechanism of Na+ capture process and provided a fundamental understanding of the rapid Na+ migration and large Na+ storage capability. This study provides insights into ration design of superior electrode materials for high&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination.

The immobilization of nanosized small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a novel strategy to achievehigh capacity, long lifespan, and superior rate capability. The N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation creates additional active sites and strengthens &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of SMOCCs nanoparticles on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring high theoretical capacities are promising cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but facing challenges in cycling stability and rate performance owing to their high solubility in organic electrolytes and low conductivity. Herein, we propose a novel architecture wherein nanosized SMOCCs with N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation are uniformly immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This approach leverages the N&#8208;heterocycles to create additional active sites and strengthen &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of nanosized SMOCCs on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration. As a demonstration, we synthesize a composite material using dipyrido[3&#8217;,2&#8217;:5,6;2&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;10,21&#8208;dione (DQDPD) as the active component, which exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in LIBs, including an ultrahigh capacity of 505&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, exceptional cycle stability with 82&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability of 290&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1. Our approach, which integrates molecular engineering and nanostructure design, provides a novel paradigm for simultaneously realizing high capacity, long lifespan, and rapid rate capability in SMOCCs.

         <title>Broadband&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition and Thermoinduced Cycloreversion&#8208;Powered Dynamic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>

Reversible [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion of pyrenylvinylpyrylium salt elicit bending of its crystals by exposure to visible light and straightening by heating. This example represents a novel concept of energy conversion where the energy stored in the bonds of the strained cyclobutane ring is converted to work of dynamic molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanically responsive dynamic molecular crystals are central to developing efficient, rapid, and robust materials capable of conversion of light energy to mechanical work. However, unlike some other, mainly photochromic molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems, solids that undergo photoinduced [2+2] cycloaddition have not been thoroughly explored for powering reversible actuation, despite that this reaction system carries potential in the heavily strained bonds of the cyclobutane ring. In this study, we propose that broadband&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition can be used to store energy and actuate dynamic organic crystals by irradiation with visible light. The prototypical material, pyrenylvinylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (1&#8211;PVPyL), undergoes a topochemical [2+2] cycloaddition induced not only by ultraviolet radiation (365&#8197;nm) but also by monochromatic green light (532&#8197;nm), red light (620&#8197;nm) and broadband visible light in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) manner, causing its crystals to bend. The crystals effectively act as energy depots, where the reverse deformation can be initiated by heating and the stored energy is released via thermal cycloreversion reaction. Given the ubiquity of the [2+2] cycloaddition in the solid state, the current study invites the development of new dimeric MOST architectures that utilize sunlight for energy storage and thermal triggers for energy release. Within a broader scope, this approach provides a platform for fabrication of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven crystal actuators capable of harnessing sunlight.

         <title>Direct Upcycling of Degraded LiCoO2 Towards High&#8208;Performance Cathodes via a Multifunctional Organic Lithium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) structure, the deficiency of Li ions severely causes cracks in the particles, leading to a slow diffusion rates and low efficiency of electrons and Li ions. The upgraded lithium cobalt oxide (LRD&#8208;LCO) was obtained by mixing the D&#8208;LCO with lithium lignosulfonate for direct regeneration by one&#8208;step annealing; the LRD&#8208;LCO structure gets integrated and smooth due to Li ions replenishment and doping by elemental Na and S, and the electron and ion transfer rates are enhanced dramatically.







Abstract
Direct recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is a promising technology for resource sustainability and environmental conservation. However, the lithium sources for cathode regeneration are typically mono&#8208;functional, resulting in low performance enhancement of the recycled material. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step direct upcycling method to recycling degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) with lithium lignosulfonate (Li&#8722;L). Li&#8722;L as a multifunctional organic lithium salt can spontaneously attach to the surface of the D&#8208;LCO molecules, thus providing replenishment of Li and doping of elemental sodium and sulfur during the regeneration process. Benefiting from the more stable structure of regenerated LCO supported by Na and S elements, the diffusion efficiency of Li ions and electrons can be improved during charging/discharging. As a result, the cell with upcycling LCO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 220.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and retention rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 10&#8197;C with a maximum cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. More importantly, life&#8208;cycle analysis shows that the upcycling method performs optimally in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as economic benefits, providing a prospective pathway for the large&#8208;scale application of recycling spent batteries.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Artificial Topological Nanostructures Enhances In Vivo Efficacy of PCSK9 Inhibitory Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformable inhibitory peptide (TIP) based on Pep2&#8208;8 targeting PCSK9 forms in situ artificial topological nanostructures (ATNs), enhancing stability and binding affinity. TIP demonstrates 18.7&#8208;fold increased PCSK9 affinity compared to Pep2&#8208;8 in vitro. In high&#8208;fat diet mouse models, TIP elevates hepatic LDLR levels (2.0&#8208;fold) and reduces LDL&#8208;C and TC, presenting a promising antibody alternative strategy.







Abstract
Optimizing the stability and affinity of peptides in vivo is critical for their development as alternatives to approved monoclonal antibodies. In recent years, efforts in academia and industry have focused on modifying Pep2&#8208;8, a classical antagonistic peptide targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), to enhance its specificity and affinity. However, developing effective PCSK9 inhibitory peptides remains challenging, especially given the limited examples of their successful in vivo applications. Here, we designed transformable inhibitory peptide (TIP) against PCSK9 based on the modular structure of Pep2&#8208;8. Upon encountering PCSK9, TIP undergoes in situ self&#8208;assembly at the epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domain A (EGF&#8208;A) binding domain of PCSK9 to form artificial topological nanostructures (ATNs). The ATNs not only enhance peptide stability and prolong in vivo retention time but also strengthen PCSK9 binding through multivalent synergistic effects. We demonstrate that compared to Pep2&#8208;8, TIP forms ATNs which increasing its binding affinity for PCSK9 by approximately 18.7&#8208;fold in vitro. In high&#8208;fat diet mouse models, TIP significantly increase hepatic LDLR levels (2.0&#8208;fold) and reduced LDL&#8208;C and TC levels. We envision that the in situ formation of ATNs by peptides enhances in vivo stability and affinity, which offering an approach for development as antibody alternatives in clinical.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerated Controllable Phase Transformation for Practical Liquid Metal Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable phase transformation electrode (PTE) was constructed, which enabled the NaK anode to process in near&#8208;solid to overcome the assembly difficulties of liquid electrodes, and then in&#8197;situ phase transformed to liquid within the battery for working to inhabit dendrites growth. The mechanism of self&#8208;induced liquid metal mediated solid&#8208;state reaction was proposed to promote this transition. Based on these, cylindrical cell with liquid NaK anode was successfully matched with outstanding electrochemical performances. The challenge of practical application of liquid electrodes is expected to be solved.







Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity, the deposition of solid alkali metals can trigger dendrites growth, causing safety risk, capacity and life decay. While liquid NaK alloy is dendrite&#8208;free, their fluidity may cause leakage or even short circuit. In this work, a novel controllable phase transformation strategy was proposed enabled NaK anode to be processed in near&#8208;solid and work in liquid, effectively overcoming the challenges of dendrite formation and leakage. Specifically, a near&#8208;solid anode was fabricated by liquid metal (LM)&#8208;assisted mechanochemistry reaction, which can be easily shaped and integrated into batteries without leakage risk. Then self&#8208;accelerated phase transformation continues within the battery, driven by an LM&#8208;mediated in&#8197;situ replacement reaction, converts the near&#8208;solid electrode into liquid state and enabling dendrite&#8208;free operation. For the first time, a cylindrical cell with liquid NaK alloy anode was successfully matched and demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances. This innovation not only enhances safety but also advancing the practical application of liquid metal electrodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Aqueous Zr/HfIV&#8208;Oxo Cluster Speciation and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometal Zr/Hf oxocluster assembly is demonstrated by solution and solid&#8208;state&#160;spectroscopies. The atomic&#8208;level mixing highlights their nearly&#8208;identical chemistry that challenges separations. However, divergent ligand lability yields a solubility gradient and explains a key difference that allows separation. Hf&#8208;selective precipitation from water introduces a &#8216;greener&#8217; method for this Zr/Hf separation that is crucial for the nuclear industry.







Abstract
Many industrial separations of chemically&#8208;similar elements are achieved by solvent extraction, exploiting differences in speciation and solubility across aqueous&#8208;organic interfaces. We recently identified [OM4(OH)6(SCN)12]4&#8722; (OM4, M=Zr/HfIV) tetrahedral oxoclusters as the main species in industrial processes that produce nuclear&#8208;grade Zr and Hf from crude ore. However, isostructural/isoelectronic OM4&#8208;oxoclusters do not explain selective extraction of Hf into the organic phase. Here we have characterized heterometal Hf&#8722;Zr clusters in solution and the solid&#8208;state yielding key information about their fundamentally different chemistry that engenders separation. Clusters prepared with both ammonium (industrial process) and tetramethylammonium counter cations revealed that 1) heterometal clusters (instead of a mixture of homometal clusters) assemble, and 2) Hf&#8208;rich OM4 selectively precipitates over Zr&#8208;rich OM4, providing a separation process that does not require an organic extractant. Mass spectrometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, solution&#8208;state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state 17O NMR evidence both mixed&#8208;metal speciation and selective Hf&#8208;precipitation. Raman spectroscopy suggests greater Zr&#8208;ligand lability than Hf&#8208;ligand lability, consistent with higher aqueous solubility of Zr&#8208;rich clusters, enabling both extraction and precipitation&#8208;based separation. Fundamentally, we also identify a key difference between these chemically similar elements that has enabled diversification of Zr&#8208;polyoxocation chemistry over the last decade, while Hf&#8208;polyoxocation chemistry lags.

     alt="Aqueous Zr/HfIV-Oxo Cluster Speciation and Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heterometal Zr/Hf oxocluster assembly&lt;/b&gt; is demonstrated by solution and solid-state&#160;spectroscopies. The atomic-level mixing highlights their nearly-identical chemistry that challenges separations. However, divergent ligand lability yields a solubility gradient and explains a key difference that allows separation. Hf-selective precipitation from water introduces a &#8216;greener&#8217; method for this Zr/Hf separation that is crucial for the nuclear industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many industrial separations of chemically-similar elements are achieved by solvent extraction, exploiting differences in speciation and solubility across aqueous-organic interfaces. We recently identified [OM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (OM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, M=Zr/Hf&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;) tetrahedral oxoclusters as the main species in industrial processes that produce nuclear-grade Zr and Hf from crude ore. However, isostructural/isoelectronic OM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-oxoclusters do not explain selective extraction of Hf into the organic phase. Here we have characterized heterometal Hf&#8722;Zr clusters in solution and the solid-state yielding key information about their fundamentally different chemistry that engenders separation.

Mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, solution-state &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and solid-state &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O NMR evidence both mixed-metal speciation and selective Hf-precipitation. Raman spectroscopy suggests greater Zr-ligand lability than Hf-ligand lability, consistent with higher aqueous solubility of Zr-rich clusters, enabling both extraction and precipitation-based separation.

         <title>Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meticulous deposition of single&#8208;atom Ir species onto P islands on In2O3 nanosheets demonstrates exceptional ethanol selectivity and yields in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The specific coordination of the Ir center with the P islands not only alters the electronic structure of the Ir center, optimizing the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules as well as their C&#8722;C coupling ability but also the P islands exhibit excellent H2 dissociation ability compared to the Ir single atomic site in Ir1/In2O3.







Abstract
The thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol has attracted significant interest because ethanol offers ease of transport and substantial value in chemical synthesis. Here, we present a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol achieved by precisely depositing single&#8208;atom Ir species on P cluster islands situated on the In2O3 nanosheets. The Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst achieves an impressive ethanol yield of 3.33&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 914&#8197;h&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;MPa (H2/CO2=3&#8201;:&#8201;1) at 180&#8201;&#176;C, nearly 8 times higher than that of the unmodified Ir1/In2O3 catalyst. Additionally, at a more industrially relevant pressure of 5.0&#8197;MPa, the TOF of the Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst can reach up to 2108&#8197;h&#8722;1, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Combined in situ characterization and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogenation process is significantly enhanced by the Ir1&#8208;Px entities. Specifically, the Ir atom facilitates CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling, while the surrounding P island exhibits exceptional H2 dissociation ability. These three steps have been found crucial for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This discovery opens new opportunities for the regulation of the microenvironment of current catalysts by providing essential chemical functionalities that enhance intricate and complex reaction processes.

         <title>Boosting C&#8208;O Bond Cleavage and Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Activity via Enriched In&#8208;Plane Sulfur Vacancies in Single&#8208;Layer Molybdenum Disulfide</title>

A dual&#8208;template method was developed to synthesize MoS2 catalysts with tunable layer numbers. Single&#8208;layer MoS2 demonstrates superior activity in the RWGS reaction, outperforming Multi&#8208;layer MoS2. Comprehensive characterization techniques combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancies enhance C&#8722;O bond cleavage, exhibiting intrinsic activity 5.8 times higher than that of edge vacancies.







Abstract
The reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to the production of valuable chemicals through CO2 utilization. However, challenges persist with the rapid deactivation and insufficient activity of catalysts. Herein, we developed a soft&#8208;hard dual&#8208;template method to synthesize layered MoS2 using inexpensive and scalable templates, enabling facile regulation of sulfur vacancies by controlling the number of layers. The concentration of in&#8208;plane vacancies keeps increasing with the reduction of MoS2 layer number, contributing to 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over single&#8208;layer MoS2 and a stable performance over 300&#8208;hour reaction at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of CO reached 35.7&#8197;gCO&#8197;gcat&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, outperforming most current catalysts. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancy sites endowed enhanced production of CO via direct dissociation of CO2, showing an intrinsic activity of above 5.8 times higher than that of edge sulfur vacancy sites. The rate&#8208;limiting step was shifted from C&#8722;O cleavage in edge to sulfur vacancy regeneration in plane with a lower energy barrier. Our findings exemplified the specified design and synthesis of MoS2 for high&#8208;temperature CO2 reduction through the effective manipulation of distinct vacancy sites, shedding light on their potential industrial application.

         <title>A Versatile Carbonylative Approach to Ureas and Carbamates through Light Activated Nickel Catalyzed Formation of Aliphatic Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile carbonylative approach to prepare aliphatic ureas and carbamates has been developed. The reaction functions with an earth abundant nickel catalyst to generate electrophilic isocyanates from C(sp3) halides, azide and carbon monoxide. The in situ addition of nucleophiles offers a unique and modular method to apply the efficiency of carbonylations to the synthesis of broad array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance in drug design.







Abstract
We describe the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed route to prepare aliphatic isocyanates via carbonylation chemistry. Unlike thermal reactions, where the affinity of Ni(0) for carbon monoxide has traditionally limited its use in carbonylations, mechanistic studies suggest that visible light excitation of a Xantphos&#8208;bound nickel catalyst can enable a radical pathway for the carbonylation of alkyl halides, while the CO&#8208;bound nickel drives the formation of a reactive acyl azide product for rapid Curtius rearrangement. Coupling this transformation with subsequent nucleophilic reactions has opened a unique and modular pathway to apply carbonylations to the synthesis of an array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance to drug design.

By designing &#960;&#8208;bridge groups of dye molecules and leveraging the molecular extrusion effect, we achieve effective interface passivation of dyes on perovskite solar cells. This approach enhances interfacial transmission characteristics, thereby improving both performance and stability.







Abstract
Additive engineering has emerged as the predominant approach for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) dyes with tailored configurations have proven to be a viable and effective strategy for passivating defects and optimizing interfacial contacts. In this study, we present two asymmetrical D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes, designated as TZR and TNR. These dyes are designed and synthesized with identical hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting backbones but feature distinct &#960;&#8208;bridge groups. They are incorporated into the precursor solution of PbI2 to facilitate in situ passivation of both interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) during the formation of the perovskite film (two&#8208;step process). These dyes effectively penetrate both buried and upper interfaces, allowing for the passivation of defects originating from the GBs, and both interfaces. This significantly reduces defects while enhancing charge transport properties. Notably, the &#960;&#8208;bridge composed of benzo[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazole in TZR contains unpaired electrons from nitrogen and sulfur atoms. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11&#8201;% is achieved. This performance significantly surpasses that of TNR&#8208;based and pristine devices, achieving PCEs of 24.47&#8201;% and 22.88&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in the stability of the unencapsulated device, attributed to the exceptional hydrophobicity of the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes. This study offers valuable insights into achieving high&#8208;performance PSCs through careful molecular design.

         <title>Unlocking Enhanced Catalysis Stability in Acidic Oxygen Evolution: Structural Insights for PEM Applications under High&#8208;Current Density</title>

La&#8208;RuO2@TM composite catalyst not only exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability in the acidic OER but also demonstrates considerable potential for application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. By incorporating La elements, the intermolecular interactions within the catalyst were effectively modified, optimizing the adsorption states of the reaction intermediates and thereby reducing the energy barrier of the reaction. These improvements not only enhanced catalytic efficiency but also increased the catalyst&#8216;s durability, effectively preventing metal leaching and the loss of lattice oxygen.







Abstract
In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that demonstrate high current density and stability are essential. Herein, we synthesized La&#8208;doped RuO2 (La&#8208;RuO2@TM) nanorod composite catalysts in situ on titanium mesh (TM) using a one&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method. La&#8208;RuO2@TM displays excellent catalytic performance (1.533&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability, showing no significant degradation in performance over 450&#8197;hours of operation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the formation of the La&#8208;O&#8722;Ru local structure modulates the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, alleviates metal (Ru) leaching, and reduces oxygen loss, significantly enhancing the material&#8216;s durability in acidic OER. The PEM electrolyzer utilizing La&#8208;RuO2@TM operates at 1.815&#8197;V with a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining stable performance for 120&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights for designing efficient and durable acidic OER catalysts.

Copper hydrides featuring cavities, AuCu24&#8208;dppp nanoclusters, reveal the catalytic active unit Cu3H3, elucidating the role of lattice&#8208;hydrogens mechanism in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products. The AuCu24&#8208;dppp clusters efficiently reduce CO2 into deeply reduced products, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 54.5&#8201;% &#8211; comprising 41.9&#8201;% for C2H4 and 12.6&#8201;% for EtOH &#8211; while demonstrating exceptional stability.







Abstract
Copper is the most efficient and practical electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) to give multicarbon (C2+) products, but the mechanism by which such products are formed &#8211; though known to involve lattice&#8208;hydrogens &#8211; remains elusive, and the selectivity of the reaction is poor. Herein, we report the synthesis of [AuCu24(dppp)6H22]+, a copper hydride nanocluster bearing exposed Cu3H3 units in specific surface cavities, and our use of it to study the mechansim and selectivity of the reduction of CO2 to C2+ products. Results of in situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations showed that these Cu3H3 units can effectively lower the energy barrier to the formation of the *COCOH intermediate, which allowed the competition between the C1 and C2 pathways to be elucidated. Isotope labeling experiments and catalyst recrystallization studies corroborated the theoretical simulations, identifying the lattice&#8208;hydrogen (H&#8722;) in the Cu3H3 active unit as being indispensable for the formation of C2H4. The molecular design guidelines which this work has facilitated constitute a new approach towards the of copper&#8208;based catalysts that convert CO2 to C2+ products based on lattice&#8208;hydrogen engineering.

This study systematically combines NAMD and DFT to explore CO2RR on Co@BP, revealing high selectivity for HCOOH (solvent&#8208;free) and CH2CH2 (solution), with the optimal mixed water/acetonitrile (1&#8201;:&#8201;9) solvent enhancing C2+ formation, while under the light multichannel photons promote CHO* coupling for C2 intermediates, emphasizing solvent effects on carrier dynamics and product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Designing effective photocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a precise understanding of the dynamically photocatalytic mechanism under real conditions (e.g. solvent, light field). Herein, we coupled ab&#8208;initio non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation to theoretically reveal the detailed dynamic process for C&#8722;C Coupling under light field on Co&#8208;supported monolayer black phosphorus (BP) catalyst Co@BP. Specially, Co@BP features excellent property for photocatalyst: high stability, long&#8208;lived photogenerated carriers and stronger reducing ability. Thermodynamically, it shown that a dramatic difference in catalytic properties with 99.99&#8201;% selectivity for HCOOH in solvent&#8208;free condition (Ea=0.29&#8197;eV) and 99.34&#8201;% selectivity for CH2CH2 in solution (Ea=0.33&#8197;eV). Slow&#8208;growth based MD simulation results uncover that mixed solvent of water/acetonitrile (H2O/ACN) is beneficial for the formation of C2+ product and the optimal ratio H2O/ACN (1&#8201;:&#8201;9) mixture solvent for the conversion of CO2 to CH2CH2. Under light irradiation, we found that multichannel photons enable adsorbed CHO* to couple with CHO species diffusing from nearby active sites, further forming C2 intermediates in solution. This work highlights the importance of the reaction medium on the photogenerative carrier dynamics and offers a strategy to regulate product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>Elucidating the Biosynthesis and Function of an Autoinducing Peptide in Clostridium acetobutylicum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the biosynthetic pathway of Ca&#8208;AIP, an accessory gene regulator (Agr)&#8208;type autoinducing peptide in Clostridium acetobutylicum. Two CAAX metalloproteases and one signal peptidase were identified to be responsible for the second processing step in Ca&#8208;AIP biosynthesis. By manipulating Ca&#8208;AIP levels, we demonstrate its significant effect on butanol production.







Abstract
Clostridia produce autoinducing peptides (AIPs) regulated by the accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, playing a critical role in intercellular communication. However, the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory functions of clostridial AIPs remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we employed chemical quantification, genetic investigations, and in vitro reconstitution experiments to elucidate the native Ca&#8208;AIP in Clostridium acetobutylicum, a prominent industrial producer of acetone, butanol, and ethanol. Our findings identified a signal peptidase (Cac1760) and two CAAX metalloproteases (Cac0077 and Cac2478) as key players in N&#8208;terminal cleavage, while AgrB was found to be essential for C&#8208;terminal processing during Ca&#8208;AIP biosynthesis. Notably, overexpression of agrBD led to a 4.4&#8208;fold enhancement in Ca&#8208;AIP formation, which corresponded with an increase in butanol production from 12.5 to 14.9&#8197;g/L, while preserving vegetative cell morphology. The direct involvement of Ca&#8208;AIP in both butanol production and maintenance of cell morphology was further validated through exogenous supplementation. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the biosynthesis of AIPs and propose a promising strategy for optimizing microbial processes in industrial applications.

         <title>An Azo Polymer with Abundant Active Sites and Extended Conjugation as a Stable Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel azo polymer (PTAP) with high site density and extended conjugated structure. The azo groups not only facilitate long&#8208;distance delocalization of &#960; electrons, but also act as an active center for the two electrons transfer to increase site density. The improved charge storage efficiency, excellent anti&#8208;solubility and rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer of PTAP endow zinc&#8208;organic batteries with high capacity, excellent rate performance, and remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Developing stable cathodes with high capacity and rapid redox kinetics is pivotal for aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A huge challenge lies in balancing the density of active sites and electronic conductivity of organic cathodes. Herein, an azo polymer from 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene&#8208;tetraone (PTAP) possessing high active components and extended conjugated structure was achieved. The extended conjugated system linked by the azo groups facilitates extensive electron delocalization and a low band gap, which endows the PTAP with enhanced electronic conductivity reaching 4.26&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1. The azo groups themselves serve as active centers for two&#8208;electron transfer, leading to a significant increase in the density of redox&#8208;active sites and charge storage efficiency. Moreover, strong intramolecular interactions and unique solvation structure bolster the anti&#8208;solubility of PTAP. Consequently, PTAP&#8208;based ZOBs exhibited high reversible capacities and rate performance, delivering 442.45&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining 248.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a ZOB showed remarkable long&#8208;term stability after cycling over 900&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies further revealed that multi&#8208;step coupling of carbonyl and azo groups accompanied by the Zn2+/H+ dual&#8208;ion insertion is responsible for rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer in PTAP. This work provides new insight into the rational design of advanced organic cathodes for high capacity and long life ZOBs.

         <title>Chemoselective Functionalization of Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds of Allylic Ethers: Enantioconvergent Access to sec,tert&#8208;Vicinal Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel dual photoredox/nickel catalytic system that enables chemo&#8208; and enantioselective functionalization of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds in allyl ethers through the generation of nucleophilic &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ni intermediates. This methodology establishes a versatile platform for constructing highly functionalized homoallylic sec, tert&#8208;vicinal diol frameworks, demonstrating exceptional stereocontrol (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee), broad functional group tolerance, and compatibility with diverse substrates.







Abstract
While enantioenriched alcohols are highly significant in medicinal chemistry, total synthesis, and materials science, the stereoselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with two adjacent stereocenters remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a dual catalysis approach utilizing photoredox and nickel catalysts to enable the unprecedented chemoselective functionalization of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds in allyl ethers instead of cleaving the C&#8722;O bond. The resulting allyl&#8208;Ni intermediates can undergo coupling with various aldehydes, facilitating a novel enantioconvergent approach to access extensively functionalized homoallylic sec,tert&#8208;vicinal diols frameworks. This protocol exhibits nice tolerance towards functional groups, a broad scope of substrates, excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggested that allyl&#8208;NiII acts as the nucleophilic species in the coupling reaction with carbonyls.

         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is substantially enhanced by the precise deposition of single&#8208;atom Ir on P islands constructed on In2O3 nanosheets. In their Research Article (e202422744), Tsz Woon Benedict Lo and co&#8208;workers report the significant enhancement of ethanol production performance by constructing P islands with excellent hydrogen dissociation capabilities. This facilitates CO2 activation and C&#63743;C coupling at Ir sites and In2O3, thereby boosting the overall catalytic efficiency of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol.

A trade&#8208;off (represented by the seesaw in the cover picture) between solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation is linked to the structural feature of hard carbon for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202425507). In a more disordered state, desolvation and the SEI work in concert. The desolvation process is progressively enhanced with increasing structural ordering.

A precise strategy for tuning defective structures in two&#8208;dimensional catalysts was developed by Yanqiang Huang, Xiong Su, Xin Shang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202422953). By employing a soft&#8211;hard dual&#8208;template approach, single&#8208;layer MoS2 with enriched in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancies was synthesized. These vacancies significantly promote C&#9472;O bond cleavage, resulting in remarkable catalytic performance in the reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

An improved stereoselective and regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization enables the formation of completely alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), as reported by Guangqiang Xu, Qinggang Wang et al. in their Communcation (e202417075). This breakthrough PLGA exhibits a record&#8208;high melting temperature (143.1&#176;C), forms a stereocomplex (211.8&#176;C) and demonstrates linear hydrolytic degradation with controlled drug release behavior, positioning it as an ideal carrier for long&#8208;acting therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Bimodal Ionic Conduction through Polymer Films due to Nano Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview revisits the phenomenon of nano&#8208;confined ion conduction through polymer films. Ions diffuse through polymer films in two distinct modes depending on the nano&#8208;structure and free space for the passage of hydrated or partially hydrated ions. The size of pathway and how it compares to the size of hydrated ion determines whether ions must shed water from the solvation shell which in essence governs the mode of ionic conduction.







Abstract
Kinetic and selectivity of ionic conduction through polymer films is a key factor in the function of many systems including membrane technology, energy devices, sensors, and corrosion. Typically, the ionic conduction is accelerated by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. However, counterintuitively, polymer films with very high electrochemical impedance demonstrate the opposite effect, i.&#8197;e. ionic conduction slows down by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. This bimodal nature of ionic conduction was discovered five decades ago and yet the mechanism has remained poorly understood. This minireview explains the long&#8208;standing anomaly through the lens of recent advances in nano&#8208;confinement electrochemistry. Emerging evidence shows that changes in solvation shells occurs due to the size of the channel through which ionic diffusion takes place. These solvation shells can significantly affect the mobility of ions, their interactions with functional groups of the polymer, and the overall conductivity of the electrolyte. At dimensions only a few nanometers, partially hydrated ions form stronger bonds with polymer slowing down the ionic conduction. Increasing ionic strength will add ion&#8208;pairing interactions further reducing ions mobility. The interplay of solvated ions, polymer chemistry, and ionic content offer an explanation for the anomalous bimodal ionic conduction.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH, particularly using metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst, has received considerable attention due to its long&#8208;term potential to harness sunlight for converting CO2 into this valuable fuel. This Perspective outlines the best practices that to provide robust and convincing evidence that CO2 is the source of CH3OH in the photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH, particularly with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalysts, has garnered significant attention due to its long&#8208;term potential to harness sunlight for converting CO2 into a valuable fuel and chemical feedstock. Numerous studies in the literature report the successful formation of CH3OH from photocatalytic CO2 reduction, sometimes supplemented with sacrificial agents, with claims substantiated by isotopic labelling measurements. However, in this Scientific Perspective, we note that much of the existing evidence has not been obtained under sufficiently rigorous experimental conditions to conclusively confirm the formation of a highly reactive product like CH3OH from the chemically stable CO2 molecule. This Scientific Perspective outlines best practices designed to provide robust evidence for CH3OH formation in photocatalytic processes, which could be instrumental in clarifying the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and accelerating the development of this technology toward practical applications.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;, Au(II)&#8208;, Au(III)&#8208;Fluoride Complexes: Synthesis and Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III) are summarised. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several developments of these complexes with a range of supporting ligands, which has enabled their reactivity to be studied. Herein, these advances are highlighted, organised by the oxidation state of Au and supporting ligand.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III), up to and including 2024, are reviewed herein. Despite the flourishing field of gold catalysis, these complexes had long been elusive due to their instability. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several reports of these complexes in recent years. The use of a variety of supporting ligands have facilitated access to these complexes, which has allowed their reactivity to be further studied and understood, thereby laying the ground for future reaction development. This review highlights these advances, organised by the formal oxidation state of the gold centre and the supporting ligand.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The process of Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (pCO2RR) into valuable chemicals is a contributing step to a sustainable future. Perovskites have high light absorption capacity in the visible spectrum, and reduction in dimensionality from 3D to 2D changes the structural and chemical properties. The review focuses on unfolding the unique properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Perovskites that make them favorable photocatalysts. The motive is to highlight and discuss their recent advances in pCO2RR using solid&#8208;vapor and liquid&#8208;solid methods, along with a basic structural discussion. This review also emphasizes innovative material design strategies and catalysis developments in 2D perovskites to enhance pCO2RR.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of Carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals is one of the most promising approaches to addressing the CO2 emission problem. However, several issues still need to be resolved to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Perovskites possess superior light absorption capacity, tunable band gaps, high defect tolerance, and diverse dimensionality. Among them, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are more stable under photocatalytic conditions and have exciting excitonic characteristics compared to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites.&#160;2D perovskites have unique physical and chemical properties, such as high stability, polaron formation, quantum well structures, and high exciton binding energies, which remain underexplored for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (pCO2RR). Tuning these properties is easier in 2D perovskites than in 3D perovskites by varying the layer thickness and spacer cations. Therefore, 2D perovskite photocatalysts are emerging as promising materials for reducing CO2 into valuable products. This review discusses the classification and synthesis methods of 2D perovskites, the unique properties that make them favorable for photocatalysis, and recent advances in applying 2D perovskites for pCO2RR by monitoring the operational methodology. It also emphasizes the potential for future developments in photocatalysis using 2D perovskites.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene vs. Thiophene &#8211; Chiral Adsorption and Unidirectional Rotation on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single NHC molecules carrying a thiophene (NHCiPr&#8722;T) and a bromo (NHCiPr&#8722;Br) substituent are investigated by STM on the Au(111) surface. Both derivatives adsorb flat on the surface and are bound to a gold adatom via the carbene. NHCiPr&#8722;T is anchored to Au(111) via the sulfur atom, thus allowing unidirectional rotation by voltage pulses with the STM tip. In comparison, NHCiPr&#8722;Br shows lateral displacement by voltage pulses.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes are highly effective ligands for anchoring functional organic molecules to metal surfaces and nanoparticles, facilitating the formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers. However, their adsorption on surface is difficult to predict and control, and there is an ongoing debate on the geometry of NHC derivatives on gold surfaces and on the role of gold adatoms. We present two single molecules based on a benzimidazole NHC, one equipped with a thiophene substituent, and the other ending with a Br atom. By low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we show that both molecules adsorb planar on Au(111) and are chiral on the surface. Our results indicate that in both cases a complex between NHC and a gold adatom is formed. Upon voltage pulses with the STM tip, both complexes move excited by inelastic tunneling electrons. For the derivative with thiophene, we observe a stepwise 60&#176; unidirectional rotation around the S atom. The direction of rotation is determined by both the chirality and the position of the applied pulse. On the contrary, the NHC derivative without thiophene moves laterally on the surface. Adsorption, binding to gold atoms, and motion are discussed with the support of density functional theory calculations and image simulations.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction Enabled by Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction was realized through a synergistic catalysis strategy by merging visible light and chiral Lewis acid, affording enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;amino &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones with high enantioselectivity and good functional group tolerance. The mechanism studies demonstrated a stereoselective radical coupling process.







Abstract
Classical aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction generally involves excess reductants. Herein, we developed a visible light&#8208;induced catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction via a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;assisted direct excitation of imines without additional reductants, enabling the carbon&#8211;iodine bond cleavage of iododifluoromethyl ketones and the subsequent enantioselective radical coupling. This protocol provided an ingenious access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino ketones containing a gem&#8208;difluorine moiety.

     alt="Reductant-Free Enantioselective Aza-Reformatsky Reaction Enabled by Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis and Lewis Acid Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reductant- and photocatalyst-free &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-Reformatsky reaction was realized through a synergistic catalysis strategy by merging visible light and chiral Lewis acid, affording enantioenriched &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-difluoromethyl ketones with high enantioselectivity and good functional group tolerance. The mechanism studies demonstrated a stereoselective radical coupling process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-Reformatsky reaction generally involves excess reductants. Herein, we developed a visible light-induced catalytic asymmetric &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;-Reformatsky reaction via a chiral Lewis acid-assisted direct excitation of imines without additional reductants, enabling the carbon&#8211;iodine bond cleavage of iododifluoromethyl ketones and the subsequent enantioselective radical coupling. This protocol provided an ingenious access to chiral &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino ketones containing a &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorine moiety. The mechanistic studies including radical trapping experiment, NMR experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance experiment, cyclic voltammetry experiment and spectroscopic analysis rationalized the reaction process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity and Magnetic Coupling of Triangulene Dimers Linked via para&#8208;Biphenyl Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangulene dimers linked by one or two para&#8208;biphenyl units were synthesized on Au(111). STM, non&#8208;contact AFM, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet magnetic exchange coupling for Dimer 1 (ES&#8208;T=15&#8197;mV), influenced by the dihedral angles of the two para&#8208;biphenyl units. Dimers 2&#8242; with an ES&#8208;T=6.6&#8197;mV were obtained from a more flexible precursor equipped with one para&#8208;biphenyl linker.







Abstract
Triangulene and its homologues are promising building blocks for high&#8208;spin low&#8208;dimensional networks with long&#8208;range magnetic order. Despite the recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of coupled triangulenes, key parameters such as the number of organic linking units or their dihedral angles remain scarce, making further studies crucial for an essential understanding of their implications. Here, we investigate the synthesis and reactivity of two triangulene dimers linked by two (Dimer 1) or one (Dimer 2) para&#8208;biphenyl units, respectively, on a metal surface in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum environment. First&#8208;principles calculations and model Hamiltonians reveal how spin excitation and radical character depend on the rotation of the para&#8208;biphenyl units. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the successful formation of Dimer 1 on Au(111). Non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) measurements resolve the twisted conformation of the linking para&#8208;biphenyl units for Dimer 1. On the contrary, the inherent flexibility of Dimer 2 induces the planarization of the para&#8208;biphenyl, resulting in the spontaneous formation of two additional five&#8208;membered rings per dimer connected by a single C&#8722;C bond (Dimers 2&#8242;). Furthermore, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic (S=0) coupling of the observed dimers, underscoring the critical influence of dihedral angles and structural flexibility of the linking units in &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic nanostructures.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Assisted Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Unsymmetric Internal Alkynes by Scandium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;assisted regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetric internal alkynes including homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and amines with hydrosilanes has been achieved by using half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst, providing an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized silylalkenes with high regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes is the most straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient method for the synthesis of silylalkenes. However, the hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes often encounters regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity challenges. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes bearing heteroatom functional groups with hydrosilanes by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. This protocol offers an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized multisubstituted silylalkenes from a variety of internal homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and tertiary amines and hydrosilanes, featuring 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and excellent regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 r.r. and &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 syn/anti). The mechanistic details have been elucidated by control experiments and isolation and examination of some key reaction intermediates. It was revealed that an interaction between the heteroatom (O, S or N) in the internal alkynes and the Sc center was critical for achieving the unprecedented high selectivity.

         <title>Interface Engineered Electrolyte Design Strategy for Ultralong&#8208;Cycle Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries over Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is the direction of development for the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the suboptimal ionic conductive properties exhibited by the electrolyte, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites due to the deposition of inhomogeneous Li+ and the potential safety hazards caused by unstable interfaces have seriously affected the cycle life of the battery at extreme temperatures. Herein, a fluoropolymer&#8208;containing plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based electrolyte (FPCE) has been developed by means of a structural engineering process, with the objective of optimizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The integration of solvent structure simulation and experimental results demonstrates that FPCE regulates Li+ transport, promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of the LiF&#8208;rich inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid SEI, and enhances the overall stability of the battery. Consequently, FPCE assists in preserving stable LFP|FPCE|Li cells cycling, with 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 C and an average capacity decay rate of merely 0.00448% per cycle. Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cells demonstrate the capacity to operate stably within the temperature range of &#8208;10 to 80 &#176;C. This study provides a valuable strategy for the design of wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;free Organic/Inorganic Interphase for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn2+ conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)&#8208;containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F&#8208;free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low&#8208;cost N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn2+ but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling over 6500 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8210;2, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1 mA cm&#8210;2, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue towards practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescent Iridium(III) Phenanthrolinedione Complexes as Lifetime&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Probes for Wash&#8208;Free Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging of Cellular Labelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic bioorthogonal probes are crucial tools in biomedical research, which enables non&#8208;invasive wash&#8208;free imaging of specific biomolecules in living systems. Lifetime&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal probes represent another promising and attractive alternative, offering the potential for real&#8208;time wash&#8208;free visualization of bioorthogonal labelling processes via photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). However, their widespread application is limited by the lack of suitable lifetime&#8208;responsive probes. Herein, a series of phosphorescent iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes were reported. Intriguingly, upon bioorthogonal reaction with an &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone derivative, the complexes exhibited remarkable emission responses in three distinct manners, which were found to correlate with the different emissive excited states of the complexes. Crucially, two of the complexes maintained similar emission intensity but exhibited significant emission lifetime elongation during labelling reactions, which facilitated simultaneous and discriminative visualization of the reacted and unreacted probes in cellular imaging without the need for washing steps. One of the complexes was used for organelle targeting and specific protein labelling through bioorthogonal reactions in living cells. The intracellular probe transportation and labelling dynamics were visualized and analyzed using PLIM. This work highlights the unique potential of lifetime&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes as powerful chemical tools for live&#8208;cell imaging and unveiling the spatiotemporal dynamics of biomolecules during bioorthogonal reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;driven Interconversion of Pyridine Dicarbanion&#8208;bonded Ag13 Nanocluster Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent screening is pivotal in the optimization of reaction conditions for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. However, to date little is known about the role of solvent effects in driving in situ structural evolution of metal&#8208;containing species towards polynuclear organometallic cluster intermediates and determining their reactivity. We herein isolate two distinct thirteen&#8208;membered silver cluster isomers, Ag13&#8208;A and Ag13&#8208;M, in acetone and methanol, respectively. Significantly, we demonstrate the interconversion of these isomers facilitated by solvent manipulation, revealing a novel aspect of organometallic nanoclusters. Mechanistic studies on the solvent&#8208;driven Ag13&#8208;A to Ag13&#8208;M transformation reveal a low activation energy of 22.39 &#177; 0.81 kcal mol&#8208;1 and a positive activation entropy, which together with theoretical investigations substantiate that the isomeric transformation involves counter anion dissociation, subsequent twisting of peripheral pyridine dicarbanion ligands, and eventual re&#8208;coordination of the counter anions. The observed differences in thermal stability and reactivity between two isomers are attributed to variations in Ag&#8208;Ag interactions and surface ligand arrangements, underscoring the critical role of solvent selection in affecting the whole organic transformation through in situ formed clusters. These findings demonstrate a new perspective on solvent dependency in metal&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations, foreseeing the necessity of considering organometallic cluster intermediates in solvent screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atomic Hybrid Glasses for Near&#8208;Infrared II Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demands for modern information communication and storage necessitate the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active optical waveguides. However, achieving efficient NIR emission with minimal optical loss remains a critical challenge. Herein, we present a new class of rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses, synthesized via bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, as a solution to these limitations. By harnessing the ultralong phosphorescence of Nd3+ doped complex glasses, these materials achieve NIR&#8208;II emission extending to 1.32 &#956;m with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ~5.7%, setting a new record among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rare&#8208;earth based complexes in the NIR&#8208;II region. This exceptional performance stems from the efficient sensitization of Nd3+ ions in hybrid glass, with a phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency of 93.55%. Furthermore, these transparent and flexible hybrid glasses trigger optical waveguiding in Eu3+&#8208; and Nd3+&#8208;doped microstructures, enabling ultralow&#8208;loss coefficients of 0.978 dB/mm at 819 nm and 5.1 dB/mm at 1048 nm, respectively. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates that metal&#8211;organic complex glasses with ultralong phosphorescence can effectively serve as sensitizer matrices for boosting NIR&#8208;II emission, but also supports the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) glassy microstructures with ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguiding for advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic&#8208;Hydrogel Hybrid Biomaterials Via In Situ Seeded Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed chemical analysis of the interactions between Au3+ ions and gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels enables the development of a robust &#8220;in situ&#8221; seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of plasmonic gold nanoparticles, whereby gold salts are reduced directly on the surface of hydrogel substrates to form the nanostructures. These hybrid plasmonic&#8208;hydrogel materials have potential applications in 3D cell culture, tumor/tissue models, and chemical and biological sensors.








Abstract
The combination of hydrogels and functional plasmonic metal nanoparticles affords the development of unique hybrid systems, such as actuators, biosensors, and drug delivery systems, among others. Being typically prepared in colloidal suspension, incorporating shape&#8208;controlled plasmonic nanoparticles on polymer substrates typically requires lengthy processes involving synthesis, washing, and self&#8208;assembly. We report an alternative, robust in situ seed&#8208;mediated growth method whereby either isotropic or anisotropic gold and silver nanoparticles can be prepared directly on gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels, taking advantage of the polymer's native chemical functionalities. In&#8208;depth characterization of gold precursor&#8211;polymer interactions enabled the rational growth of branched gold nanoparticles on biocompatible hydrogels with different physicochemical properties. In situ seeded growth circumvents traditional limitations imposed by the need for colloidal stability, thereby enabling gold nanoparticle synthesis under surfactant&#8208;free conditions and in high ionic strength solutions, thus enhancing their suitability for applications involving live cells. This method can be expanded to create libraries of hybrid plasmonic materials with potential impact in the fabrication of functional 3D cell culture substrates, as well as biological and chemical sensors.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of hydrogels and functional plasmonic metal nanoparticles affords the development of unique hybrid systems, such as actuators, biosensors, and drug delivery systems, among others. Being typically prepared in colloidal suspension, incorporating shape-controlled plasmonic nanoparticles on polymer substrates typically requires lengthy processes involving synthesis, washing, and self-assembly. We report an alternative, robust in situ seed-mediated growth method whereby either isotropic or anisotropic gold and silver nanoparticles can be prepared directly on gelatin-based hydrogels, taking advantage of the polymer's native chemical functionalities. In-depth characterization of gold precursor&#8211;polymer interactions enabled the rational growth of branched gold nanoparticles on biocompatible hydrogels with different physicochemical properties. In situ seeded growth circumvents traditional limitations imposed by the need for colloidal stability, thereby enabling gold nanoparticle synthesis under surfactant-free conditions and in high ionic strength solutions, thus enhancing their suitability for applications involving live cells. This method can be expanded to create libraries of hybrid plasmonic materials with potential impact in the fabrication of functional 3D cell culture substrates, as well as biological and chemical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Molecular Recognition for Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Mediated Reversible Photochemical Control Over mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule ligand undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamer in a selective manner, dependent on both the RNA sequence/structure and ligand chemical structure. A caged mRNA construct incorporating the PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or p53 coding sequence remained translationally repressed until exposure to 302&#160;nm light, which cleaved the photocage and restored translation in vitro and in cells, enabling precise photochemical control of both wild type and reporter gene expression.








Abstract
Chemical probes that control the function of complex RNA molecules offer unique opportunities to interrogate biological systems. In this study, we demonstrate that a small molecule ligand selectively recognizes and undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamers. This effect is selective and dependent on both the chemical structure and RNA sequence/structure. A homogeneously modified, caged mRNA construct containing a PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or wild type p53 coding sequence displayed repressed translation in vitro or in cells until irradiated with 302&#160;nm light, resulting in cleavage of the photocage and restoration of translation. This method demonstrates for the first time that aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition of a small molecule ligand can be used to precisely and photochemically activate the translation of a complex mRNA in cells.

         <title>Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I) Alkynyl Nanoclusters with Exposed Polyoxomolybdate Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directed synthesis of copper(I) nanoclusters with atomically precise active sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses notable challenges. By carefully regulating the acidity of the reaction system, a set of five atomically precise Mo&#8208;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters were effectively synthesized. The adjustment of the reaction system&#8217;s acidity stimulates the polymerization of molybdate, consequently influencing the encapsulation structure of the outer copper(I) shell and thereby controlling the number of catalytically active sites located at the periphery of these nanoclusters. When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8208;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 160.8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO2RR system, the maximum CO production rates for Mo16Cu36&#8208;1 and Mo22Cu30 were 5672.1 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 7370.8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#8722;O&#8722;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study elucidates the synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity Mo&#8208;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Control over Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Elucidating Electron Transfer Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising functional materials due to their programmable architectures and tunable functionalities. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of porphyrin&#8208;based 2D COFs remains restricted by the prevalent use of sql topology, hindering comprehensive structure&#8208;property exploration. Herein, we systematically designed and synthesized porphyrinic 2D COFs featuring distinct sql and bex topological configurations. Comprehensive structural characterization confirmed precise control over lattice geometries, revealing monoporous structure in sql topology versus biporous architecture in bex topology. Electrochemical investigations uncovered topologygoverned electron transport characteristics, with the unique coordination geometry of bex topology exhibiting enhanced electron transfer efficiency. Band structure analysis demonstrated that topological configuration and chemical composition collectively modulate electronic structures. Inspired by these findings, we developed nickel&#8208;incorporated bex&#8208;COFs for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. The optimized Ni&#8208;BBFPP&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF with bex topology demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, achieving a low overpotential of 342 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, which surpasses most reported porphyrin&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This study not only significantly expands the structural repertoire of porphyrinic COFs, but also establishes explicit correlations between topological engineering and electrocatalytic performance, providing fundamental design principles for advanced energy conversion materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Engineering of Asymmetric Tri&#8208;active Sites by Symbiotic Strategy for Photocontrolled Directional Reforming of Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sunlight&#8208;driven production of high&#8208;value chemicals from renewable resources represents a pivotal driver toward achieving sustainable energy supply. However, fundamental barriers include inadequate use of light energy and insufficient understanding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating mechanisms in photocatalytic processes. To address this, a novel symbiotic strategy for&#160;design of Cux/TiO2 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations was proposed. The developed catalyst achieved nearly 100% conversion and selectivity for the directional photo&#8208;oxidative transformation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) or 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under both vis&#8208;light and UV&#8208;vis light conditions. Importantly, compared to previous works, this catalyst exhibited&#160;highest photo&#8208;oxidation activity while effectively suppressing&#160;over&#8208;oxidation of HMF to CO2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that rational construction of Cu SAs could effectively create the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ti structure, which significantly enhanced&#160;activation of O2 and HMF, facilitating generation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) and Ti3+. Furthermore, Cu SAs served as hole (h+) extractors in the photo&#8208;oxidation process, promoting rapid charge carrier transfer and ROS formation. The applicability of this developed strategy was further demonstrated for photo&#8208;oxidative conversion of various bio&#8208;feedstocks including HMF and alcoholic substrates, indicating its great potential for harnessing light energy for sustainable valorization of biomass into high&#8208;value chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructions of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles through Phosphine&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Controlled Switch of Selectivity between Intra&#8208; and Inter&#8208;Molecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rigid biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles serve as core scaffolds in numerous bioactive molecules. However, constructing biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles smaller than 14&#8208;membered ring remains challenging, partially due to the strain present in the cyclic intermediates formed during their synthesis. Here, we report that a Pd catalyst supported by P(tBu)3 effectively promotes the intramolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H arylation of phenols with aryl bromides, leading to the efficient synthesis of both strained 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles and strain&#8208;free bimolecular counterparts. The success of this Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization in generating strained macrocycles originates from the dissociation of the P(tBu)3 ligand from the Pd center, which facilitates dual chelation of functional groups of substrates to the Pd center of palladacycle intermediate for alleviating its strain. Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemo&#8208;selectivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Multifunctional Oxygen Vacancies for Plasma&#8208;Driven Air&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current ammonia (NH3) synthesis is hindered by challenges including N2 activation, NH3 separation, and process complexity. Here we report a plasma&#8208;electrochemical process for the production of gaseous ammonia from air generated NOx, decoupled from processes employing liquid phase intermediaries such as NO3&#8722; and final product (NH4+). Importantly, this process uses air for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions, and directly produces gaseous NH3 which facilitates efficient product separation. For NOx reduction to NH3, we propose a universal strategy combining plasma pretreatment and wet chemical calcination to introduce multifunctional oxygen vacancies. The resulting highly defective Fe2O3 nanoparticles on Cu achieves a significant ammonia production rate of 628 nmol&#183;s&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2, along with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Divergent Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with Quinones for the Synthesis of Diverse Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) are highly strained hydrocarbons with unique structural properties and intrinsic reactivity, making them valuable building blocks for constructing complex molecular architectures. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed divergent reactions of BCBs with quinones, yielding a diverse array of polycyclic molecules. Using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as a catalyst, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs efficiently undergo formal (3+2) cycloaddition reactions with quinones, producing highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes featuring a caged framework. Monosubstituted BCB ketones undergo a sequential cascade involving Alder&#8208;ene reaction, 4&#960; electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening, and [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, yielding fused benzoxepines efficiently. Disubstituted BCB esters, ketones, and amides undergo a tandem isomerization and (3+2) cycloaddition process, stereoselectively yielding tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofuran products. Notably, strong Lewis acids such as SnCl&#8324; and BiBr&#8323; directly participate in the ring&#8208;opening reactions of monosubstituted BCB ketones, generating halogenated cyclobutane derivatives. Additionally, the synthetic potential of these approaches has been further highlighted through scale&#8208;up experiments and a range of transformations. This study demonstrates the tunability of reaction pathways based on the diverse substitution patterns of BCBs, providing efficient methods for the synthesis of a range of polycyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Helical Columnar Liquid Crystal Exhibiting Both Polarization Retention and Ferroelectric Switching at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric columnar liquid crystals (FCLCs) with switchable bistable axial polarizations are promising candidates for high&#8208;density ferroelectric random&#8208;access memory (FeRAM). However, FCLCs simultaneously exhibiting uniform polarization arrangement and ferroelectric switching at room temperature (RT) remain elusive. Herein, we report an RT&#8208;operable FCLC based on a C3&#8208;symmetric star&#8208;shaped mesogen with polar linkers. Two CLCs, 1 and 2, were synthesized incorporating 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and amide linkers, respectively. 1 undergoes a ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition accompanied by a structural change from a helical to a non&#8208;helical columnar phase. Notably, the ferroelectric switching is operable down to RT, with complete retention of its axial macrodipole after removal of the electric field. In contrast, 2 forms only a non&#8208;helical columnar LC phase, displaying paraelectric behavior. The contrasting self&#8208;assembly and dielectric properties are attributed to the differences in the polar unit size. This study demonstrates that the mesogen extension with a bulky 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker enables the realization of a FCLC operable at RT, offering significant potential for high&#8208;density FeRAM applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of three rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids, (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol A (1), (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol B (2) and (&#8211;)&#8208;Sanguinolane (3), using a 13, 17 and 14 step longest&#8208;linear sequences respectively, featuring a novel intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition to construct the unique pentacyclic framework containing an unprecedented tricyclo[3.3.1.02,7]nonane motif. Other key steps in the synthetic route include a highly challenging, selective alkene reduction via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leveraging the thermodynamic preference for a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical; a Robinson&#8208;type annulation to construct the tricyclic terpenoid building block; and applying aerobic oxidation at two distinct points to form &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, facilitating the enantioselective syntheses of these diterpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Synergistic Dual Activation Enables Efficient Transesterification by Multi&#8208;nuclear Titanium Catalyst: Recycling and Upcycling of Polyester Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and selective catalysts for chemical recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is essential for establishing a sustainable plastics economy and reducing environmental impact. Here, we report a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that enables highly efficient transesterification reaction of esters and polyesters. Detailed experimental and computational studies have revealed that a bi&#8208;titanium framework facilitates a dual activation mechanism, activating both alcohol and ester simultaneously, thereby significantly enhancing the transesterification process. This catalyst demonstrated exceptionally high activity in the methanolysis of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with an activity up to 1.9 &#215;107 gPET molTi&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 0.005 mol % catalyst loading, producing polymerizable dimethyl ester and glycol monomers. Additionally, it effectively catalyzed the re&#8208;polymerization of the recovered monomers, yielding the original polyester with high molecular weight and thereby achieving an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, this catalyst can also be utilized for the efficient upgrading of PET waste via transesterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol, polybutylene adipate, and poly(tetramethyene ether glycol), yielding engineering plastic, biodegradable polyester, and thermoplastic elastomer, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven Exploration of Surface Reconstructions of Reduced Rutile TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active&#8208;learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results by comparing experimental and theoretical high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Mediated Rearrangement of Bis(alkynyl)boranes: B&#8211;C Activation vs C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions between Rosenthal&#8217;s titanocene (Cp2Ti) and decamethyltitanocene (Cp*2Ti) synthons with various bis(alkynyl)boranes were investigated. A series of titanium&#8208;fused boracyclobutenes were obtained through the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)2NB(CCR)2 or PhB(CCPh)2. This represents the first realization of approaching this structural motif via the rearrangement of bis(alkynyl)boranes within the coordination sphere of a d&#8208;block metal. These findings break the previous limitation that the boron substituent must be an amino group. Furthermore, the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)PhNB(CCPh)2 or (Mes2B)PhNB(CCPh)2 (Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) led to the formation of novel tethered metallocene complexes, in which the titanacyclopentadiene structure is linked to one of the cyclopentadienyl groups via a &#8211;CH2&#8211;BR&#8211; bridge. Both experimental and theoretical studies provided insights into an unprecedented reaction mechanism. The process involves the initial formation of an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated bis(alkynyl)borane intermediate, which was detected and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This intermediate subsequently undergoes either B&#8211;Calkynyl bond activation or CMe&#8211;H activation of the Cp* ligand, leading to the formation of two distinct types of products.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the reaction of the Cp*2Ti synthon with (Me3Si)PhNB(CCPh)2 or (Mes2B)PhNB(CCPh)2 (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) led to the formation of novel tethered metallocene complexes, in which the titanacyclopentadiene structure is linked to one of the cyclopentadienyl groups via a &#8211;CH2&#8211;BR&#8211; bridge. Both experimental and theoretical studies provided insights into an unprecedented reaction mechanism. The process involves the initial formation of an &#951;2-coordinated bis(alkynyl)borane intermediate, which was detected and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. This intermediate subsequently undergoes either B&#8211;Calkynyl bond activation or CMe&#8211;H activation of the Cp* ligand, leading to the formation of two distinct types of products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Pure Nitrate Reduction via Tuning Bimetallic Sites in Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) represents a promising approach for ammonia synthesis, but existing application has been constrained by the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics induced by various intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a series of metalized covalent organic frameworks: NiTP&#8722;MTAPP MCOFs (M = 2H, Co, Cu and Fe), based on dual redox&#8208;active centers: thiophene&#8208;substituted Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) ligand&#8208;Ni[C2S2(C4H2SCHO)2]2 and metallic porphyrin. Through regulating the adsorption and desorption of species at the catalytic sites, we have identified the optimal NITRR electrocatalyst: NiTP&#8722;CoTAPP MCOF, which achieved the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 85.6% at &#8208;0.8 V (vs. RHE) in pure nitrate solution, with an impressive yield rate of 160.2 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1cat. The generation of active hydrogen at [NiS4] sites achieved dynamic equilibrium with the timely hydrogenation reaction at CoN4 sites, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of thiophene (TP) groups and metal ions facilitates charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the reduction in energy barriers at different catalytic sites. The CoN4&#8722;NiS4 system exhibited the optimal adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption capability and the lowest energy barrier (0.58 eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO &#8594; *HNO), which is supported by the moderate d&#8208;band center and Bader charge value.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Photochemical Conversion of Atmospheric Chlorinated Organics on Mineral Dust: In&#8208;field Evidence of a New Source of Dioxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hazardous chemicals are typically assessed based on their inherent toxicity, often neglecting the fact that their atmospheric secondary transformation products may exhibit increased toxicity and persistence, potentially exceeding the risks associated with the parent chemicals. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are a significant class of commercial chemicals, but their secondary conversion in the  atmosphere remains largely unknown. Herein, by combining laboratory and in&#8208;field experiments,we have identified a new conversion pathway that the CVOCs can be photochemically transformed into polychlorinated dibenzo&#8208;p&#8208;dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) on mineral dust particulates under atmospheric conditions. We showed that mineral components, particularly Fe&#8208; and Al&#8208;related oxides, can efficiently convert monochlorobenzene, dichloromethane and perchloroethylene into PCDD/Fs under light irradiation. By combing reaction product measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 exhibited much higher propensity for dioxin formation than &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, as evidenced by its lower reaction energy barriers for both the initial phenol formation and subsequent chlorination processes. In particular, histopathological assays showed the photochemically&#8208;reacted &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 can cause severe damage to the lung and brain tissues of mice, underscoring the need to reassess the toxicity of commercial CVOCs and their secondary transformation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Promoted Activation of Light Alkanes at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical activation of light alkanes into value&#8208;added products represents a promising pathway for sustainable chemical synthesis and the storage of renewable energy. In this study, we introduce an electrochemically promoted system that employs copper plates as electrode and oxygen as oxidant, capable of converting ethane into ethylene and acetic acid with production rates of 6.9 and 6.2 &#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, with a combined selectivity exceeding 92%, under ambient conditions. Additionally, this system can convert propane to propylene at a rate of 11.6 &#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, with selectivity reaching up to 86%. A 10&#8208;hour run with ethane demonstrates consistent production of ethylene and acetic acid, with a sustained selectivity above 96% and achieving an acetic acid concentration of 19 mM. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals the active surface and a critical reaction intermediate. Combining with partial pressure dependence study and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a potential reaction mechanism involving the competitive adsorption of oxygen and alkane producing an alkyl group as a key reaction step in the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Erasable Fluorescence Imaging Technology Enables Continuous Tracking for Identical Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new erasable labeling method, utilizing melamine&#8208;mediated reversible DNA self&#8208;assembly, realizes fluorescence labeling at 25&#160;&#176;C and fluorescence erasing at 37&#160;&#176;C for the specific marker on the identical living cell at any time. Due to its simple conditions satisfying the most fundamental experimental scenarios, this method has high potential as a powerful preliminary screening tool for new biological mechanisms through continuously tracking the life activities of cells.








Abstract
Subtle molecular events may trigger a cascade of &#8220;butterfly effects&#8221; to reverse cell fate, so dynamic tracking of relevant markers can provide crucial clues to decipher the unknown. However, existing analytical techniques are still at static&#8208;analysis level, and cutting&#8208;edge fluorescence imaging is limited by signal interference at adjacent time, failing to realize continuous observation for identical live cells. Herein, we develop a new temperature&#8208;controlled imaging technology, where melamine&#8208;mediated reversible DNA self&#8208;assembly drives the fluorescence illuminating and extinguishing at any time, achieving repeated erasable imaging for identical living cells. This method can track cell behaviors by taking dynamic monitoring of cell differentiation as an example, and timely fluorescence erasing guarantees authenticity for imaging results and minimizes interference with cellular activities. Thanks to high feasibility in fundamental experimental scenarios, this method hopefully provides a powerful preliminary screening tool for exploring new biological mechanisms in cell interactions, developmental transformations, downstream response inquiry, and so forth.

         <title>Meticulous Design of High&#8208;Polarity Interface Material for FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 26.47%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing new interface materials with the multifunctions of upper film crystallization control, interfacial defects passivation, and interfacial energy level regulation is crucial for developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a high polarity interfacial material, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;trimethylammonium bromide (CNCB), was synthesized to engineer the buried interface between SnO2 and perovskite of the PSCs. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that CNCB interacts with perovskite precursor (PbI2 and FAI) to regulate crystallization kinetics, yielding perovskite films with preferred orientation and reduced defects. Simultaneously, CNCB chemically interacts with both SnO2 and perovskite surfaces, effectively passivating oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and undercoordinated Pb2+ defects at the perovskite buried surface. Furthermore, the high dipole moment of CNCB induces beneficial interfacial polarization, optimizing energy level alignment and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The CNCB&#8208;modified FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.47% with exceptional operational stability, retaining 87.14% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination. This work establishes a molecular design paradigm for multifunctional interfacial materials in perovskite optoelectronics, highlighting the synergistic roles of crystallization control, defect passivation, and dipole engineering in high&#8208;performance devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to lacking of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron (III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#8208;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me&#8208;SCB) and ethyl short chain branching (Et&#8208;SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight. C&#8208;H&#8230;F interactions and &#963;&#8208;&#960; interactions are found between LDPE and the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism that fluorine on the ligand facilitates hydrogen peroxide activation and subsequent deprotonation, leading to the formation of high&#8208;valent iron oxo species. The growth of SCB involves the &#946;&#8208;scission of C&#8208;C bonds and radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. This work represents a transformative advancement in deep understanding of polyolefin upcycling and opening new approach of polyolefin functionalization and architecture modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Detection of Photomagnetic Effect in a Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Neodymium(III)&#8211;Octacyanidotungstate(IV) Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin&#8208;transition materials, including spin&#8208;crossover complexes, and sometimes it leads to magnetic ordering. Photo&#8208;induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin&#8208;crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic NdIII&#8211;[WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and theoretically rationalize near&#8208;infrared emission of NdIII centers sensitized by [WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd3+ excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light&#8208;induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read&#8208;out.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization Polymerization of Elemental Sulfur and Diisocyanate: New Polymerization Toward High Performance Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of polymer materials heavily relies on new polymerization reactions. Herein, we report the discovery of cyclization polymerization of element sulfur (S8) and aliphatic diisocyanate at room temperature with 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) organic base as the catalyst, where the two monomers are covalently linked via formation of thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) or cyclic isocyanurate ring. The polymer of S8 and 1,6&#8208;diisocyanatohexane (HDI) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Particularly, it has exceptionally high adhesion to various substrates in air or under water, e.g., the underwater adhesion strength is as high as ~26.5 MPa for poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and ~2.3 MPa for poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon). The cyclization polymerization provides the basis for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance polymers with elemental sulfur.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyanation of Propargylic Radicals Derived from Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report an efficient method to synthesize enantiomerically enriched propargyl nitriles via copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyanation of propargylic radicals, which are generated from silyl&#8208;substituted allenes or alkynes. These reactions proceeded through a highly site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) with Cu(II)&#8208;bound nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs). Notably, silyl&#8208; substituted allenes demonstrate exceptional allenic sp2 C&#8208;H bond activation selectivity, outcompeting alternative reactive sp3 C&#8208;H bonds (benzylic, allylic, and heteroatom&#8208;adjacent) in HAA processes. This chemo&#8208;selectivity profile enables precise enantiocontrol and site&#8208;specific functionalization of complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Desulfurizative Fluorination of N&#8211;CF3 Thioformamides for the Efficient Synthesis of N(CF3)(CF2H) Amines with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With poor metabolic stability being a major cause of failure in drug development, there is a pressing need for strategic molecular modifications to optimize for desired properties and function. N&#8208;substitution has emerged as a powerful approach, with N&#8208;CF&#8323; amines previously demonstrating enhanced lipophilicity and reduced susceptibility to oxidation, albeit inherent instability to hydrolysis. This report discloses the further evolution of this motif &#8208; the introduction of an additional N&#8208;difluoromethyl unit, resulting in an extraordinary 2,000&#8208;fold increase in stability. We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF&#8323;)(CF&#8322;H) amines. The method relies on an operationally simple desulfurization&#8211;fluorination strategy of N&#8208;CF&#8323; thioformamides and is characterized by broad functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphosphorus Ligand Complexes of Coinage Metals for Multiple Capturing of Intact P4 Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208; and three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8209;P5)] (CpR&#160;= C5(CH3)5 (Cp*, 1a), C5(4&#8209;EtC6H4)5) (CpPEt, 1b)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH3CN)4][SbF6] or AgSbF6 were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered CpR ligand and non&#8208;coordinating anions. In the self&#8208;assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P4 tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P4 in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinated cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P4 molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining SuFEx Inhibitor Development: A Unified Approach Using Photolabile and Orthogonal Sulfinate Protecting Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have gained significant importance due to their classification as a click reaction and therefore have seen increased use in drug discovery and biochemistry.&#160; Their use, however, is complicated by the methods by which they are synthesized and their general synthetic instability.&#160; This results in sulfonyl fluorides being introduced late in a synthetic route with minimal structural diversity.&#160; Masking the reactivity of a sulfonyl fluoride by protecting the parent sulfinate is one method to ameliorate these issues.&#160; Current sulfinate protecting groups however possess limited stability. This study outlines discovery and selection of sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs) based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions.&#160; This includes the discovery of two novel, photolabile sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs), para&#8208;methoxybenzyl Rongalite and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl Rongalite that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride using light and selectfluor.&#160; Along with known SPG, 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl sulfone (SES), all three SPGs were found to possess broad stability when exposed to numerous common synthetic conditions and are easily coupled to aryl halides from their sulfinate salt precursor. &#160;Their utility is then demonstrated in the synthesis of SPG containing building blocks that are incorporated into several bioactive small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of Intermolecular Weak Binding through the Zero&#8208;Field Splitting of an Endofullerene High&#8208;Spin Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak binding between molecules is becoming a renowned aspect of molecular engineering, offering an alternative to the tuning of conventional chemical bonds. However, the subtle nature of these interactions poses challenges for characterization using standard techniques. Herein, an efficient method of weak binding characterization based on the zero&#8208;field splitting of a high&#8208;spin probe by electron paramagnetic resonance is presented. Using Endofullerene as the high spin center, we achieved direct comparison of the weak binding strengths in F&#8208;MTPP (M = H2, Zn, Ni, and Pd) and 2F&#8208;3MTPP (M = H2, Ni, Pd, and Pt) through the zero&#8208;field splitting parameters. The high&#8208;spin resonance spectrum is sensitive to the small variation in the supramolecular structure. By examining fullerene&#8208;porphyrin co&#8208;crystals with various metal centers and packing arrangements, the relation between intermolecular weak binding and microstructural strain on the fullerene cage is elucidated.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, photoinduced radical hydroarylation of unactivated N&#8208;allylamine derivatives is reported for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that ipso attack is more favourable than ortho attack when one of the ortho positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide&#8208;containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Looking towards ever&#8208;growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices we have employed two bird&#8208;one stone approach viz.enabling 2e&#8208; oxygen electron reaction (ORR) to value added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO4 catalyst, without any external H2O2 source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H2O2 production of 98% @ 0.37 V vs. RHE. The real time H2O2 production was monitored by in&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition viz., local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was&#160;examined through micro&#8208;electrochemical studies using gold&#160;micro&#8208;electrode. Further, we assembled aqueous&#160;Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery &#160;which exhibited&#160;remarkable cycle life of 140 hours and energy efficiency of 43%. The&#160;Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery attained capacity of 25 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 3 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;with&#160;&#8805; 90 % of cycle efficiency and stability&#160;for more than 140 hours. and exhibited a stable OCV&#160;of 3.2 V for more than 200 hours with a promising power density of 10.5 mW cm&#8208;2. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries by powering 26 LEDs for more than 180 hours (7 days) without fading in the illumination of LEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Prebiotic Interconversion of Pyruvate and Lactate over Zeolite&#8208;Supported Ni Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni mineral can catalyze the interconversion of metabolically crucial pyruvate and lactate under hydrothermal vent conditions, which could pave the way for the modern biological process by lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.








Abstract
Submarine hydrothermal vents harbor diverse microbial communities and have long intrigued researchers studying the origin of life. Transition metals in these environments can be reduced by serpentinization, potentially forming zeolite&#8208;supported transition metal nanoparticles capable of driving prebiotic chemistry. This inorganic structure could catalyze biochemical reactions, including converting metabolically crucial pyruvate before the emergence of biological processes. This study explores the catalytic interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, mediated by lactate dehydrogenase in biochemical systems, using inorganic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni nanoparticles (Ni/Y) under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Our results demonstrate that Ni/Y effectively catalyzes the hydrogenation of pyruvate in an inert environment, facilitated by the in situ generation of H&#8322; through an autocatalytic reaction between Ni/Y and H&#8322;O. Post&#8208;reaction analysis by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed structural transformations in the catalyst, including the formation of unique nickel oxide and hydroxide species, along with extra&#8208;framework aluminum from zeolite dealumination, resulting in a thin amorphous nickel oxide/hydroxide layer. Notably, Ni/Y also enables the oxidative reconversion of lactate to pyruvate under atmospheric conditions&#8212;an essential reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in biological systems. These findings underscore the potential prebiotic role of Ni/Y, suggesting they may have catalyzed the synthesis of key metabolic intermediates.

         <title>Constructing Large&#8208;Area Oriented Covalent Organic Framework Based PN Heterostructure Films to Enhance Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose for the first time the concept of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid oriented PN heterostructured films to modulate the photocatalytic performance by constructing COF&#8208;based PN heterostructured films, and our mechanistic studies confirm that oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COFs based on thin films of PN heterostructures can provide the driving force to enhance the separation efficiency and transport kinetics of photogenerated carriers, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films exhibit enormous application potential in the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), however, they suffer from various photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we first report a new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COF&#8208;based PN heterostructure film through single&#8208;layer MoS2 induced growth, significantly enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, which promotes the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Experimental results reveal that the as&#8208;made oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF/MoS2 (TAPB: 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) benzene, DMTA: 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) film exhibits a high photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 8154 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is &#8764;2.5 times and &#8764;4 times higher than that of non&#8208;oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF films and powder. The mechanism reveals that the oriented structure of the TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF can significantly promote the generation and the transmission of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs along the skeleton and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking direction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2O2 performance. The new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COFs&#8208;based PN heterostructure film for enhancing the photosynthesis of H2O2 will open the door to rational design of molecular films towards high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.

         <title>Rapid Access to Conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;Trienes</title>

Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene: A novel method to facilitate rapid access to the otherwise inaccessible conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif is reported.








Abstract
Intercepting reactions have recently emerged as an innovative approach in organic synthesis, allowing chemists to harness reactive intermediates to access structures and functionalities that conventional methods cannot easily achieve. By deliberately manipulating reaction pathways, this strategy provides a unique avenue to explore unusual reactivities and complex molecular architectures. In this work, we have developed a new protocol for the nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation reaction (NuBFr). Employing tropone oxime tosylate &#8211; a simple and readily accessible precursor&#160;&#8211;&#160;and a diverse set of nucleophiles generated in situ from alcohols, phenols, thiols and alkynes with strong bases, we successfully synthesized a library of novel conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitrile derivatives. This method facilitates rapid access to the conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif, a structural feature rarely encountered in synthetic chemistry. Our computational studies indicate that the NuBFr reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bicylic azirine intermediate. The resulting Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitriles could undergo an unprecedented thermally induced 8&#960;/6&#960;/4&#960; electrocyclization cascade sequence to produce trisubstituted olefins. This sequence underscores the fundamental value of these motifs in pushing the boundaries of unusual reactivities in organic synthesis.

         <title>Immunoengineering of a Photocaged 5&#180;&#8208;triphosphate Oligoribonucleotide Ligand for Spatiotemporal Control of RIG&#8208;I Activation in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for precise control of RIG&#8208;I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), an innate immune receptor of RNA that, when activated, induces anti&#8208;tumor immune responses and cancer cell death. By incorporating photocage modifications into RNA ligands, we enable a spatially and temporally regulated immune response and offer a targeted strategy for cancer therapy while minimizing systemic effects.








Abstract
Photochemical control of oligonucleotides bears great potential for the spatio&#8208;temporal control of therapeutic targets, such as immune sensing receptors. Retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I) is a cytoplasmic receptor of the innate immune system that triggers antiviral responses upon detection of viral RNA. RIG&#8208;I can be specifically activated by short double&#8208;stranded (ds) RNA with a blunt 5&#8242; end bearing a triphosphate, mimicking nascent viral transcripts. Tumor cells are specifically sensitive to RIG&#8208;I&#8208;induced cell death. Here we developed a potent oligonucleotide ligand for spatiotemporally controlled activation of RIG&#8208;I by light exposure. Through structural considerations and functional studies we identified a combination of two nucleoside positions in a RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand for which the substitution of both respective 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of the ribose by photolabile protecting groups (2&#8242;&#8208;photocages) resulted in a complete loss of RIG&#8208;I ligand activity, whereas photocaging the individual positions was not sufficient to turn off RIG&#8208;I. Light exposure fully restored RIG&#8208;I activation by the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand, enabling light&#8208;controlled RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated cell death of human cancer cells which had internalized the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand prior to light exposure. This novel photoactivatable RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand may be applicable for precise light&#8208;controlled induction of tumor cell death in superficial cancer such as melanoma.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A General and Efficient Method for the Direct Synthesis of Primary Arylamines Through Electrochemical Amination of Aryl Halides With NH3 Has Been Developed.

This Approach Shows Good Functional Group Tolerance and a Broad Scope of Functionalized Primary Arylamines That Can be Further Late&#8208;stage Modification of Drug Molecules and Gram&#8208;scale Reaction Demonstrate Its Synthetic Utility.








Abstract
Primary arylamines are the most pivotal class of organic motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, ligands and natural products. Ammonia (NH3) is an ideal nitrogen source in terms of reactivity, atom economy, and environmental compatibility. Despite significant progress in the synthesis of primary arylamines, the development of a general method for rapid access to diversely functionalized primary arylamines is still urgent and necessary. Herein, we developed a method for the direct synthesis of primary arylamines through electrochemical amination of aryl halides with NH3. Notably, the weak nucleophilic reagent NH3 was directly used as an ammonia surrogate, allowing for efficient conversion of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds to diverse primary arylamines with good functional group tolerance. A broad scope of functionalized primary arylamines has been achieved in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Low&#8208;Redox&#8208;Barrier Two&#8208;Electron p&#8208;Type Phenoselenazine Cathode for Superior Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron organic chalcogen small molecules as cathode materials were reported, where phenoselenazine liberates high dual&#8208;electron utilization of 99.2% due to high coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow activation energy (0.23&#160;eV). The Zn&#8208;organic battery delivers the highest capacity storage and energy density among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with good cycling stability.








Abstract
Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials with high redox potentials and fast kinetics have captured widespread attention in propelling Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). However, their anion&#8208;accessible capacity is insufficient due to single electron reaction and/or high energy barrier of each redox&#8208;active unit. Here, we design two&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type organic chalcogen small molecules (phenoxazine (PO), phenothiazine (PS), and phenoselenazine (PSe)) with tuned charge distributions and electron transfer behaviors as cathode materials for ZOBs. With the decrease of chalcogenide electronegativity (O&#160;&gt;&#160;S&#160;&gt;&#160;Se), PSe liberates the strongest coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow redox activation energy (0.23&#160;vs. 0.34&#160;eV of PS and 0.41&#160;eV of PO), which contributes to high dual&#8208;electron utilization of phenazine motifs of 99.2% (vs. 68.8% of PS and 52.7% of PO). Consequently, Zn||PSe battery delivers the highest capacity storage (227&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (273&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with long life (10&#160;000 cycles). A two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is unlocked at amine/selenium sites of PSe, accompanied by reversible uptake of two CF3SO3&#8722; anions. This study highlights the considerable potential of low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier multielectron design for high&#8208;performance organic cathodes toward advanced ZOBs.

         <title>Optical Probes for Cellular Imaging of G&#8208;quadruplexes: Beyond Fluorescence Intensity Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA can fold into tetra&#8208;stranded helical structures known as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). There is mounting evidence suggesting that these structures have important biological roles. In this minireview we discuss advances in the design of optical probes for the detection of G4s that offer intensity&#8208;independent readouts that address limitations of conventional fluorescence intensity&#8208;based probes.








Abstract
The study of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures that form in DNA and RNA is a rapidly growing field, which has evolved from in vitro studies of isolated G4 sequences to genome&#8208;wide detection of G4s in a cellular context. This work has revealed the tangible and significant effects that G4s may have on biological regulation. This minireview describes recent progress in the design of photoluminescent intensity&#8208;independent optical probes for G4s. We discuss the design and use of probes based on fluorescence or phosphorescence lifetime, rather than intensity&#8208;based detection; spectral ratiometric probes; and fluorescent probes for single&#8208;molecule G4&#8208;detection. We argue that each of these modalities improve unbiased G4 detection in cellular experiments, overcoming problems associated with unknown cellular uptake of probes or their organelle concentration. We discuss the improvements offered by these types of probes, as well as limitations and future research directions needed to facilitate more robust research into G4 biology.

In this minireview we discuss advances in the design of optical probes for the detection of G4s that offer intensity-independent readouts that address limitations of conventional fluorescence intensity-based probes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of G-quadruplex (G4) structures that form in DNA and RNA is a rapidly growing field, which has evolved from in vitro studies of isolated G4 sequences to genome-wide detection of G4s in a cellular context. This work has revealed the tangible and significant effects that G4s may have on biological regulation. This minireview describes recent progress in the design of photoluminescent intensity-independent optical probes for G4s. We discuss the design and use of probes based on fluorescence or phosphorescence lifetime, rather than intensity-based detection; spectral ratiometric probes; and fluorescent probes for single-molecule G4-detection. We argue that each of these modalities improve unbiased G4 detection in cellular experiments, overcoming problems associated with unknown cellular uptake of probes or their organelle concentration. We discuss the improvements offered by these types of probes, as well as limitations and future research directions needed to facilitate more robust research into G4 biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circular RNA&#8208;Based Molecular Computation Enhances Plasma Biomarker Detection in Biliary Tract Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Although large panels based on multi&#8208;biomarkers have demonstrated potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, their clinical application is hindered by complexity and high costs. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a DNA&#8208;based molecular computation system that integrates the detection of plasma circular RNAs (circRNAs) with molecular computation, enabling intelligent and rapid diagnosis of BTC. By identifying and validating a specific and small set of circRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in BTC patients, we designed a DNA computation framework that directly translates biomarker levels into diagnostic outcomes without the need of external analysis and interpretation. In a validation cohort of 70 individuals, our approach achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its potential as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient tool for rapid diagnosis of BTC. This work highlights the potential of molecular computation in enhancing integrated and rapid cancer diagnostics, paving the way for clinical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the catalytic degradation of unsaturated polyolefin materials via Fe&#8208;based Lewis acids&#8208;initiated carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradation and recyclability of polymeric materials including extensively used polyolefins is becoming increasingly necessary. Chemically stable saturated polyolefin backbones make their degradation frustratedly challenging. The current effective strategy is to create cleavable defects e.g. C=C double bonds along the backbone, subsequently depolymerize them via cross&#8208;metathesis reaction with olefins. High&#8208;value chemicals or reusable polymeric segments are obtained. This two&#8208;step protocol provides operable means for alleviating plastics problems. There are several approaches to introduce unsaturation into polymer backbone like dehydrogenation or copolymerization of olefins and conjugated dienes. However, for the second step to conduct cross&#8208;metathesis reaction, only noble metal catalysts can be used in most time. Regardless of their limited availability, that these organometallics are unfavorably sensitive to impurities would raise barriers in industrial practices. Herein we employed earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive iron&#8208;based Lewis acids to initiate carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction between ketone/aldehyde reagents and unsaturated polyolefins. After explorations in poly(diene)s and industrial thermoplastic elastomers, we extended this protocol to degrade low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). Low&#8208;molecular weight PE wax&#8208;like products were obtained as useful chemicals. This catalytic degradation system is expected to enable the development of more efficient metathesis strategies to promote degradation of polyolefins and pave sustainable ways for reuse of polymeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Arylation of Arenes: the Key Role of Bis&#8208;Cyclometalated Intermediates.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;directed C&#8208;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes has been under intense scrutiny over the last decade, with conflicting proposals concerning the relevance of various catalytic intermediates and the nature of the key steps. This work presents experimental and computational studies that address these long&#8208;standing questions. Stoichiometric, catalytic and mechanistic kinetic studies, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species are key intermediates in these reactions. These studies also show that oxidative addition with bromoarenes proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition pathway, as demonstrated by DFT and experimental kinetic orders. Bromoarene activation does not proceed at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species. In the catalytic process, zero order kinetics are observed on both reaction substrates, an observation that is rationalised by DFT calculations which predict a rate&#8208;limiting step within the product&#8208;release stage. These results showcase how detailed experimental and DFT studies can combine to probe mechanistic questions, as well as resolving opposing views around the mechanism of these Ru&#8208;catalysed arylations that form the basis of promising mild C&#8208;H functionalisations.</dc:description>

         <title>Leaching&#8208;Induced Ti Trapping Stabilizes Amorphous IrOx for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal nitrides are promising conductive support materials in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas it is unclear if their electrochemical oxidation during prolonged test would affect the OER catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that the leaching&#8208;induced Ti trapping effect from TiN supports effectively stabilizes the electrochemically oxidized amorphous IrOx catalyst. Structural characterizations reveal that the TiN support experiences severe leaching during OER test, leaving minor amounts of Ti&#8208;O species trapping on IrOx clusters, which mitigate the overoxidation of Ir(III) species and elongate the Ir&#8208;O bonds. This leads to 70% reduction of lattice oxygen oxidation and the substantially reduced Ir leaching. Additionally, self&#8208;thickening of the catalyst layers is found during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), enabling an ultralow catalyst loading of 87 &#956;gIr cm&#8208;2 to obtain a stable operation at 1.0 A cm&#8208;2 for 500 h. This work deepens the understanding of TiN supported catalysts for long&#8208;term stable OER electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride (Ag@T&#9472;C3N4), a material with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. Under visible light, Ag@T&#9472;C3N4 catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, achieving production rates of 4729.82 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 and 19.71 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for benzaldehyde. The synergy between thiophene conjugation and silver atoms extends visible light absorption and accelerates the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enhancing H2O2 yield. Photogenerated holes oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, while the biphasic benzaldehyde&#8208;water system enables spontaneous product separation. In situ Raman spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode testing, EPR, GC&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations highlight the critical role of thiophene&#8208;silver synergy in optimizing reaction pathways, enhancing catalyst&#8208;intermediate interactions, and reducing Gibbs free energy, improving H2O2 and benzaldehyde synthesis. This study provides new insights for designing carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers a strategy for co&#8208;producing value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>An Autonomously Liquefied Hydrogel Adhesive for Programmable Bioelectronic Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel adhesives have many important applications in the fields of drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and bioelectronics. The detachment of hydrogel adhesives under the benign conditions is vital to the definitive surgical repair and implanted devices. Although stimuli&#8208;mediated detachment of hydrogel adhesives has been achieved, it is still a grand challenge to develop a transient adhesive with programmable adhesion and autonomous detachment from the substrate, especially the hairy skins. Here, we report a transient hydrogel adhesive driven by antagonistic enzyme reaction networks for programmable bioelectronic interface. The transient hydrogel shows tunable mechanical properties, adjustable adhesive strength, and autonomous sol&#8208;gel&#8208;sol transition with a programmable lifetime. Moreover, the transient hydrogel adhesive enables conformable and&#160;stable&#160;adhesion to various materials. In particular, the bioelectrode coated by the transient hydrogel adhesive allows to record stable and high&#8208;quality electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram signals directly on the hairy skins without hair shaving. Notably, the autonomous liquefication of the hydrogel adhesives enables the easy removal of bioelectrode from hairy skins after usage without any noticeable damages to the hairy skins and electrode. This work paves a new avenue in the innovative development of hydrogel adhesives for the conformable and detachable bioelectronic interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Allylic C&#9472;H Amination of Olefin with Nitroarenes via Intermolecular Nitroso Ene Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a practical method for synthesizing aromatic allylamines via iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive allylic amination. This approach eliminates the need for noble metals and complements existing oxidative allylic amination by tolerating oxidizable and nucleophilic functionalities.








Abstract
Aromatic allylamines are essential in the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical building blocks. While oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination using anilines has advanced significantly, achieving intermolecular reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination of olefins with readily available nitroarenes remains a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate that replacing silanes with a combination of protons and electrons enables selective reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination, avoiding the competing hydroamination pathway. The key to this transformation is the use of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) as the solvent. This process complements previous oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination by eliminating the need for noble metal catalysts while tolerating oxidizable or nucleophilic functional groups. Notably, this method facilitates the functionalization of bioactive compounds, underscoring its potential in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, by leveraging its reactivity with trisubstituted olefins, this approach, when combined with metal hydride atom transfer (MHAT) reactions, offers a unique strategy for regioselective and modular difunctionalization of aliphatic olefins. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies highlight the crucial roles of TFE in stabilizing the nitrosoarene intermediate and promoting the key nitroso&#8208;ene step.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thianthrene Covalent Trimer Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials for Low&#8208;Concentration Oxygen Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emission system of fluorescence (Fluo.) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling was constructed via thianthrene covalent trimerization, enabling high oxygen sensitivity and ratiometric optical oxygen sensing. The significant emission color and intensity change under varying oxygen concentrations allows for real&#8208;time video&#8208;based monitoring of low&#8208;concentration oxygen.








Abstract
Oxygen is ubiquitous and vital to life, industry, and environmental safety, so accurate and reliable oxygen sensing and detection are of great significance, especially for oxygen in the low concentration range. Herein, two pure organic metal&#8208;free room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials were developed using a covalent trimerization strategy of thianthrene (TA), which exhibit high oxygen sensitivity and fluorescence&#8208;RTP separated dual emission due to the moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Compared with traditional metal&#8208;organic complexes, the oxygen sensitivity of RTP is improved by about two orders of magnitude, especially facilitating accurate quantitative detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen. Leveraging oxygen quenching&#8208;induced changes in emission color and intensity, coupled with computer&#8208;assisted image processing, a simple oxygen monitoring device was established to realize real&#8208;time and accurate detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen, promoting the industrial practical application in many related fields.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing and Interfacial Contact via Halogenated N&#8208;Glycidyl Carbazole Small Molecules for Low Energy Loss and Highly Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ideal interfacial contact and non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) limit their further development. Herein, two carbazole&#8208;based molecules with different halogen atoms (X&#8208;OCZ, X = Cl or Br) are developed as efficient interfacial regulators. The halogen effect not only finely modulates the molecular packing, crystallinity, and surface contact potential of MeO&#8208;2PACz analogue via self&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions, but also significantly influences the subsequent crystal growth of perovskite, thus resulting in the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity, improved energy level alignment, and depressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Importantly, Cl&#8208;OCZ mediated device exhibits a minimal interfacial carrier transport energy barrier of 0.10 eV and an impressive charge collection efficiency of 93.6%. Moreover, the target device (aperture area: 0.09 cm2) shows the highest efficiency of 26.57% (certified 26.4%) along with enhanced thermal and operational stability. The strategy is also extended to large area devices, delivering efficiencies of 25.0% for a 1 cm2 device and 22.9% for a 12.96 cm2 minimodule. This study highlights the halogen role of interfacial small molecules on optimizing molecular packing and interfacial contact toward highly efficient PSCs with minimized energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose Toward Propyl&#8208; or Propenyl&#8208;Substituted Monomers and Mechanistic Understanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol solvolyzed lignin followed by simultaneous cleavage of C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bond enables valorization of native lignin in biomass toward prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (79.6% selectivity) and propyl (81.7% selectivity) substituted monomers under N2 and H2 atmosphere, respectively.








Abstract
Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru0.8/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4&#8208;propylguaiacol and 4&#8208;propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H2 pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N2 atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)guaiacol and 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol&#8208;extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general donor fusion strategy is proposed to extend frontier molecular orbital delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed. BN&#8208;PhAzCz achieves the best device performances, exhibiting green emission at 528&#160;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69), maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2%, and efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising candidates for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Here, we propose a general strategy for post&#8208;functionalizing MR core, introducing donors on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position via Suzuki coupling and then fusing the donors to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position via Scholl cyclization, which can extend frontier molecular orbitals delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed, achieving large spectral red&#8208;shifts while maintaining narrowband emission. The distorted configuration resulting from the hetero[6]helicene structure introduces twisted &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, which effectively enhances spinorbit coupling, ultimately enabling molecule BN&#8208;PhAzCz to achieve a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC = 6.4 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1). BN&#8208;PhAzCz&#8208;based single&#8208;host OLED exhibits green emission at 528 nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2% with efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 under 5 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 29.6% with little change in the spectral profile.

         <title>Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via Anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;Type Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition is reported. Various (hetero)arene nucleophiles and carbon electrophiles were incorporated in a manner opposite to conventional regioselectivity. A key feature of this reaction is the formation of an alkylpalladium intermediate, which enables the achievement of the uncommon regioselectivity.








Abstract
Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#946;&#8208;position and an electrophile at the &#945;&#8208;position. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the &#945;&#8208;position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the &#946;&#8208;position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the &#945;&#8208;addition of a nucleophile.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis was developed to access aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers. The resulting aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability and stability, as well as a range of desirable thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, showing potential toward sustainable materials.








Abstract
The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#9472;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.

         <title>Design and Construction of D&#8208;A&#8208;Extended 3D Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study successfully developed three distinct 3D extended D&#8208;A COFs with a pyr topology by employing a newly designed intrinsic D&#8208;A type building block. Among these, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A structured COF stands out due to its multiple charge transfer channels in 3D space, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. This finding provides valuable insights into designing extended D&#8208;A constructs within 3D frameworks to optimize photocatalytic performance. 








Abstract
The development of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Although most studies have concentrated on 2D COFs, research into their 3D counterparts remains limited. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a carbazoyl dicyanobenzene derivative (TBFCC) as an intrinsic D&#8208;A building block. By selecting TAPA, TAPB, and TAPT as the donor, acceptor&#8208;&#960;, and acceptor donors, respectively, we synthesized three distinct D&#8208;A&#8208;extended COF materials: D&#8208;D&#8208;A, A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;A, and A&#8208;D&#8208;A. Among these, 3D&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF, featuring an A&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported 3D COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in 3D space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Enantioselective Photochemical Generation of a Short&#8208;Lived, Twisted Cycloheptenone Isomer: Catalytic Formation, Detection, and Consecutive Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, it was for the first time shown that planar chiral trans&#8208;cycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;enones, such as 2, can be formed enantioselectively from their cis&#8208;isomers by triplet energy transfer from a chiral catalyst. Computational studies performed with cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone and enone 1 provided invaluable insights into the mode of action of the sensitizing thioxanthone catalyst.








Abstract
Cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization from its cis&#8208; to its trans&#8208;form either upon direct irradiation (&#955;&#160;=&#160;366&#160;nm) or in the presence of a triplet sensitizer (&#955;&#160;=&#160;459&#160;nm). The intermediate chiral trans&#8208;isomer was detected by step&#8208;scan FTIR, displaying a lifetime of 130&#160;&#181;s (r.t., CH2Cl2). Ensuing Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of the trans&#8208;isomer occurred smoothly and produced chiral trans&#8208;fused cycloaddition products (14 examples, 24%&#8211;98% yield). Benzylation led to esters, which were separated by chiral HPLC and which were employed to evaluate a possible enantioselective reaction course. It was discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid with a pendant sensitizing group induces a notable enantioselectivity in the photoisomerization step. The planar chirality of the trans&#8208;cycloheptene translates into point chirality in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (seven examples, up to 38% ee). Computational studies suggest that the chiral conformation of the cis&#8208;isomer adopted within the assembly to the chiral phosphoric acid induces the enantioselectivity in a one&#8208;bond flip (OBF) toward the trans&#8208;isomer. Trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations showed exemplarily how a chiral trans&#8208;cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone is formed from a chiral cis&#8208;conformer. For the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a weak ground state selectivity was found to attenuate the enantioselectivity achieved in the photochemical step.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclohept-2-enone-3-carboxylic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization from its &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- to its &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-form either upon direct irradiation (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;366&#160;nm) or in the presence of a triplet sensitizer (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;459&#160;nm). The intermediate chiral &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isomer was detected by step-scan FTIR, displaying a lifetime of 130&#160;&#181;s (r.t., CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Ensuing Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isomer occurred smoothly and produced chiral &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-fused cycloaddition products (14 examples, 24%&#8211;98% yield). Benzylation led to esters, which were separated by chiral HPLC and which were employed to evaluate a possible enantioselective reaction course. It was discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid with a pendant sensitizing group induces a notable enantioselectivity in the photoisomerization step. The planar chirality of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cycloheptene translates into point chirality in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (seven examples, up to 38% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Computational studies suggest that the chiral conformation of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer adopted within the assembly to the chiral phosphoric acid induces the enantioselectivity in a one-bond flip (OBF) toward the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isomer. Trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations showed exemplarily how a chiral &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclohept-2-enone is formed from a chiral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-conformer. For the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a weak ground state selectivity was found to attenuate the enantioselectivity achieved in the photochemical step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ternary Metalation in a Copper&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Tandem Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem photocatalytic heterometallic COF system combining photosensitive Ru sites, CO&#8208;producing Co sites, and multi&#8208;electron&#8208;reducing trinuclear Cu sites has been constructed by a sequential post&#8208;synthetic metallization strategy. The synergistic effect of the multiple Ru, Co, and Cu sites leads to a highly efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with efficient synergistic effects for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction is sought&#8208;after yet challenging. Herein, a tandem photocatalytic strategy has been developed through sequential post&#8208;synthetic metalation (SPSM) of variable Ru/Co&#8208;sites into a trinuclear Cu&#8208;based COF, Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, to construct a series of tri&#8208;metallized covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the Ru:Co molar ratios of 1/39.6, 1/19.6, or 1/12.7, respectively), for photocatalytic CO2 methanation in high selectivity. The introduction of a small fraction of Ru&#8208;sites confers the framework with enhanced visible&#8208;light response, while the Co&#8208;sites immobilized in the bipyridine units significantly boost the generation of CO to enrich its concentration around the active trinuclear Cu&#8208;sites, which enables dramatically improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity toward CH4. Significantly, the optimized Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;2 showcases exceptional photocatalytic activity with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%, 15.0 times higher than that of Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru) merely introducing Ru&#8208;photosensitizer. The underlying photocatalytic mechanism has been studied to unveil how the ternary Ru/Co/Cu&#8208;sites collaborate to result in highly efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, shedding light on the design of highly selective CO2 methanation photocatalysts by leveraging the synergistic effect of multiple active centers within heterometallic covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (HM&#8208;COFs).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Methanol Activation on Hexagonal CdS for Triggering C&#9472;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal&#8208;CdS&#8208;based photocatalytic methanol activation was employed for triggering C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The hole&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated cleavage of methanol C&#9472;H bond and electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated reduction of hydroxymethylated intermediate were identified. Such transformations not only facilitate the cascade utilization of photogenerated holes and electrons, but also enable selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated products.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven methanol activation paves the way for pursuing C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, where selectively converting methanol into the corresponding hydroxymethyl radical (&#8226;CH2OH) is an essential prerequisite. Inspired by the versatile methanol activation on photoexcited solids, we here report a practicable semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic system for C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. To be specific, hexagonal cadmium sulfide (h&#8208;CdS) was identified to be an ideal platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic methanol activation, where selective &#8226;CH2OH generation undergoing a hole&#8208;transfer process without any additional co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvent could trigger C&#9472;H hydroxymethylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The following electron transfer between photoexcited h&#8208;CdS and hydroxymethylated intermediates could finally lead to the formation of methylated N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformations facilitate the cascade utilization of photoinduced hole and electron, thereby endowing h&#8208;CdS with extraordinary photocatalytic performance. Besides, selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated product could be facilely implemented in the presence/absence of electron scavengers.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Enables Access to High&#8208;Performance Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Polyamides with Chemical Recyclability</title>

         <dc:description>
To address these key challenges faced in PA6 chemistry, we aimed to prepare a new class of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams bearing various substituents (BLMR) as monomers. The robust polymerization of these monomers furnished a series of semiaromatic polyamides P(BLMR) with improved water resistance, transparency, and chemical recyclability.








Abstract
Although polyamides (PAs) have served as one of the most important engineering thermoplastics, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for chemical recycling of PAs to monomers. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a series of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams with various functionalities (BLMR). These BLMR monomers underwent robust and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization to afford P(BLMR) products with high thermal stability, enhanced water resistance, and tunable mechanical properties. Impressively, chemical recycling of P(BLMR) to monomer could be accomplished with excellent efficiency in dilute solution at 100&#8722;150 &#176;C with a mixed catalyst of t&#8208;BuOK and La[N(SiMe3)2]3, thus establishing a closed&#8208;loop circularity. The precise control of the polymerization and the recyclability of these semiaromatic polyamides promote a sustainable circular economy while offering the potential to access high&#8208;performance materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties and enhanced water resistance.

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one&#8208;step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD&#8208;based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, and the n&#8208;doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. 








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and finally to n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one-step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD-based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p-type to ambipolar and ultimately to n-type upon thermal annealing, and the n-doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Conjugated polymers with deep-positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n-type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron-deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene-2,5-dione (TTD), via one step from a low-cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low-lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n-doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p-type to ambipolar and finally to n-type in organic field-effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n-doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n-doped quinoid-based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron-deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high-performing n-type polymer semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retained Oxygen Regulation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper for Promoted CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thickness determined strategy has been demonstrated to regulate oxygen retention in oxide&#8208;derived Cu for CO2 electroreduction. With the thickness decreasing to 1.6&#160;nm, the CuO nanosheets exhibit enhanced oxygen retention and reoxidation ability, achieving up to 84.6% C2+ faradaic efficiency at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the retained oxygen facilitates *CHO intermediate formation and promotes *OC&#9472;CHO coupling, thereby enhancing C2+ selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products provides an attractive route to store intermittent renewable electricity as high value&#8208;added chemicals. Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) has been widely investigated for its tunable selectivity toward multicarbon (C2+) products; however, it still remains a challenge to understand and regulate the retained oxygen of OD&#8208;Cu in the complex reconstruction process. In this work, we investigate thickness determined residual oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, using CuO nanosheets as prototype precatalysts. When the thickness of CuO precatalyst decreased to 1.6&#160;nm, the enhancement of the ability to retain oxygen are achieved, leading to selective C2+ production with Faradaic efficiency of around 80% over a wide current density range of 300&#8211;700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a peak value of 84.6% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Long&#8208;time molecular dynamics simulations reveal the enhanced stability of Cu&#8211;CuO structure with the layers of removed oxygen increased, favoring *CHO formation and *OC&#8208;CHO coupling toward C2+ products; structural characterizations and electrochemical results further demonstrate the reconstructed stacked nanosheets with high oxygen retention capacity and easily reoxidized metallic Cu sites. This work underscores the crucial role of the retained oxygen for the OD&#8208;Cu performance and provides insights into designing OD&#8208;Cu with oxygen retention to enhance C2+ products formation.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Molecular Configuration to Drive Facet&#8208;Selective Zn Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental study elucidating the influence of dicarboxylic acids with varying alkyl chain lengths on their adsorption configuration, strength, and deposition rate on Zn surfaces, which ultimately enables control over highly facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition at metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface.








Abstract
The direct use of metal anode emerges as a key strategy in advancing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, applicable across non&#8208;protonic, aqueous, and solid&#8208;state battery systems. To enhance battery durability, one effective approach involves employing interfacial molecular modification to modulate metal's facet orientation, reducing the tendency of metals to form random and loose morphologies during deposition. Herein, we propose a model to elucidate how dicarboxylic acid molecules with varying alkyl chain lengths modulate their adsorption behavior and deposition rate on zinc (Zn) surfaces, achieving facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition. Taking glutaric acid (GA) as an example, its medium alkyl chain length allows for a &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption configuration on Zn(002) surface, resulting in strong adsorption and Zn&#8208;GA metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface. This regulates Zn2+ diffusion process and restricts its accessibility to Zn(002) facet, facilitating the selective exposure of Zn(002) facet. Due to this design, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell stably operates at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge of 85%. The Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity of 1.1&#160;Ah with 90% capacity retention. This metal&#8208;molecule interface design can be extended to other metal anodes, with the potential for tailored molecular selections to regulate the selective growth of crystal facets.

         <title>The Role of Convex Edge Site in Fully&#8208;Exposed Pt Cluster Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters on CeO2 outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites and hollow sites) in cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction due to their excellent C&#9472;H bond activation capability and prohibition of undesired C&#9472;C bond cleavage&#8208;induced site reactions or benzene poisoning. 








Abstract
Achieving a precise understanding of the active site structure has long been an ultimate goal in fundamental heterogeneous catalysis research, yet it remains exceptionally challenging in nanocluster catalysis. In Pt&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexane dehydrogenation for liquid organic carriers (LOHC), previous efforts have provided valuable insights into the size effects of nanoclusters. However, the optimal geometry of the active sites has remained elusive and, at times, contradictory. In this study, we investigate the geometric effect and the active site structure in fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters supported on ceria that exhibit superior activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation (11.4&#160;mol molPt&#8722;&#185; s&#8722;&#185;), characterized by small coordination numbers, high metal utilization efficiency, and abundant convex edge sites. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites, hollow sites, etc.) in dehydrogenation reactions. These convex edge sites are not only efficient in C&#9472;H activation but, more notably, are also resistant to detrimental carbonaceous intermediates, hence enabling high and long&#8208;lived H2 production activity.

         <title>Application of Molecular Ferroelectric in Photocatalytic Selective Oxidization of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) achieves a remarkable 104&#8208;fold enhancement in alkane oxidation activity compared to BaTiO3, with a turnover number (TON) of 6286 under light and ultrasound. Its built&#8208;in electric field enables efficient charge separation, while synergistic effects drive reactive oxygen species generation, highlighting its promising application in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics utilize metal nodes and organic groups as catalytic active sites, with the surrounding ferroelectric polarization significantly enhancing catalytic activity and showcasing tremendous application potential. However, their application in photocatalysis remains underexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) as a photocatalyst for alkane oxidation. Under the combined effects of light and ultrasound, this catalyst exhibited a notable turnover number (TON) of 6286&#160;&#177;&#160;491, which is 104 times higher than that of inorganic ferroelectrics like barium titanate (BaTiO3). The molecular ferroelectric exhibits excellent recyclability, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies indicate that the built&#8208;in electric field within the molecular ferroelectric facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results further reveal that the synergistic effects of light and ultrasound effectively generate reactive oxygen species. These findings underscore the unique advantages of molecular ferroelectrics compared to rigid inorganic counterparts, including their distinctive structural features and finely tunable catalytic performance, highlighting their potential for developing homogeneous, precisely active sites and efficient photocatalysts. This research lays the foundation for the broader application of molecular ferroelectrics in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>A Photoactivatable Plasma Membrane Probe Based on a Self&#8208;Triggered Photooxidation Cascade for Live Cell Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we establish a new photoswitching concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC). Rhodamine dyes have mild photosensitizing properties that enable subsequent photoactivation and photobleaching of a leuco&#8208;rhodamine plasma membrane probe. Upon laser irradiation in the visible range, we successfully performed live SMLM (Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy), allowing to image the plasma membrane at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging based on the localization of single emitters requires a spatio&#8208;temporal control of the ON and OFF states. To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here, we present a concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane&#8208;targeted leuco&#8208;rhodamine (LRhod&#8208;PM), a non&#8208;fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod&#8208;PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable of oxidizing the OFF state LRhod&#8208;PM thereby switching it to its ON state. We showed that this phenomenon is kinetically favored by a high local concentration and propagates quickly when the probe is embedded in membrane bilayers. In addition, we showed that the close proximity of the dyes favors the photobleaching. At the single&#8208;molecule level, the concomitant activation/bleaching phenomena allow reaching a single&#8208;molecule blinking regime enabling single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy for super&#8208;resolution of live cellular membranes and their thin processes including filopodia and tuneling nanotubes.

         <title>Origin of Lithium Dendrite Formation in Sulfide&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionization levels (ILs) of typical Li3PS4 (LPS) configurations served as effective descriptors to evaluate the preference of Li0 deposition within LPS&#8208;based electrolytes. Both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, comprising crystalline LPS (c&#8208;LPS), amorphous LPS (a&#8208;LPS), and fully lithiated LPS (LixLPS), were predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including crack surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), were identified as critical contributors to the Li dendrite initiation and propagation over the course of battery cycling, ultimately driving dendrite growth.








Abstract
The Li dendrite growth during battery cycles is a well&#8208;known obstacle to the practical application of sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes (SEs), notably Li3PS4 (LPS), in lithium metal batteries. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the mechanism for Li dendrite penetration through SEs exhibiting high shear modulus. Herein, we investigate the optimum deposition sites for Li0 atoms within typical LPS configurations, encompassing crystalline, lithiated, and degraded structures, with their ionization levels employed as descriptors to determine the preferential state (Li0/Li+) of the interstitial Li. Our results suggest that both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including cracks&#160;and grain boundaries (GBs), exhibit a marked propensity to promote the electrochemical deposition of Li0 atoms. Once Li dendrites initiate, the electronic conductivities of those defects undergo a significant surge, catalyzing electron transport and facilitating Li dendrite penetration through the SEs, ultimately driving dendrite growth. Furthermore, we underscore the synergistic interaction between Li dendrite propagation and crack formation within SEs, offering deeper insights into the electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation mechanism in SEs. These findings present novel methodologies for predicting Li dendrite growth and open up alternative perspectives in SE engineering.

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Thermal Expansion in Coordination Polymer Cd(1,2,4&#8208;Triazole)2(H2PO4)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural dynamics and the chemical bonding origin of a volumetric near&#8208;zero thermal expansion in a coordination polymer across 25&#160;K to 400&#160;K is studied using multi&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography and X&#8208;ray electron density analysis. The lattice expansion in the a and c directions is counteracted by contraction along b axis, caused by concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom librations of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near&#8208;zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd&#8208;Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25&#160;K&#8211;400&#160;K. Using multi&#8208;temperature high&#8208;resolution single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine&#8208;rack&#8208;like framework of Cd&#8208;Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn&#8208;Tz and Mn&#8208;Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd&#8208;Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c&#8764;22&#160;MK&#8722;1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b&#8764;&#8722;47&#160;MK&#8722;1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs. X&#8208;ray electron density analysis and modeling of low&#8208;temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd&#8208;triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (&#8764;8/12%) in the Cd&#8208;Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Tri&#8208;Coordinated Cobalt Sites in Silicate&#8208;1 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;free electrocatalyst based on embedding Co sites into silicate&#8208;1 zeolite exhibits exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of silicate&#8208;1 zeolite isolates Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. Such a moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption while it holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the whole barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieves a high yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) emerges as a sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. However, metal catalysts are commonly supported by graphitic carbon that is susceptible to being oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated in ORR and have limited oxygen capacities. Here, we report a silica&#8208;based electrocatalyst embedding cobalt (Co) sites into silicate&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolite, which exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of S&#8208;1 zeolite highly isolated Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. The nanochannels of S&#8208;1 zeolite further provide robust and substantial reaction spaces, where the Co(OSi)3 moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption and holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieved high Faradaic efficiency over 96% and a steady yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a gas diffusion electrode setup. This work provides a novel insight into 2e&#8722; ORR on Co sites and highlights the potential of zeolite&#8208;based materials for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Modulating Active Hydrogen Supply and O2 Adsorption: Sulfur Vacancy Matters for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalyst of Ni doped ZnS with sulfur vacancy is designed for photocatalytic H2O2 production via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The Ni and S dual sites with optimized O2 adsorption and efficient *Hads supply contributes to a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water.








Abstract
Photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) represents a promising approach for H2O2 production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O2 adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni&#8208;doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv) as a dual&#8208;site 2e&#8722; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H2O2 production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron&#8208;rich state enable a Pauling&#8208;type (end&#8208;on) O2 adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O2 and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#9472;O bond cleavage. Besides, the formation of electron&#8208;deficient S sites weakens the S&#9472;Hads bond, facilitating *Hads migration to adjacent Ni sites and accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of O2 to OOH* intermediate. As a result, the elaborately designed Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv photocatalyst exhibits a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water. Our work offers new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis systems.

         <title>Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) materials based on chiral anion strategy were synthesized with high&#8208;performance circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) in amorphous states. The trade&#8208;off problem between good processability and high asymmetry factor was solved by constructing CLIP molecules and utilizing polymer entanglement or rapid solvent evaporation to form amorphous structures.








Abstract
Chiral ion&#8208;pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter&#8208;ionic substrate. When the achiral counter&#8208;ions were endowed with luminescent properties, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophores and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (&#934;PL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to &#8722;0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC). Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self&#8208;assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial AI&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.








Abstract
Inflammation plays a crucial role in progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); thus, the discovery of rapid and precise analytical tools to assess inflammation related to CVDs is highly desirable for their diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. However, a straightforward and systematic method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in heart organoids has yet to be developed. Herein, we describe the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach has been developed to construct three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, which can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures and exhibit photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. 








Abstract
Compared to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates has, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M&#160;=&#160;Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, which is dependent on their different electronic structures.

         <title>Catch, Cut, or Block? Versatile 4&#8208;N&#8208;Derivatized Sialyl Glycosides for Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Detection and Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids synthesized by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme (OP2E) chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy have been shown to be versatile probes. They can resist sialidase cleavage, be selective substrates by influenza sialidases, or be nanomolar substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors and affinity ligands selectively for influenza sialidases. Beads immobilized with 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;sialosides have been demonstrated for purifying influenza virions.








Abstract
Seasonal influenza continues to threaten human lives and pose a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy, emphasizing the need for developing better influenza vaccines, diagnostics, and antiviral therapeutics. To address these challenges, we generated a library of structurally diverse sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy. Sialosides containing 4&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted sialic acid were selectively cleaved by sialidases from influenza viruses, whereas sialosides containing 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid were resistant to sialidase cleavage. Interestingly, sialosides containing 4&#8208;amino&#8208; or 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid were effective inhibitors moderately or highly resistant to cleavage by influenza sialidases (also called neuraminidases). The sialosides containing the 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid represent a new class of sialidase substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors. We took advantage of this unique property to create a ligand&#8208;based approach for efficiently isolating influenza virions from egg allantoic fluid with high purity. Together, these compounds are versatile probes and ligands for developing new approaches to detect, profile, isolate, and characterize influenza viruses via neuraminidases on their surface.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Regulation of Catalytic DNA Circuits Using Phosphorylated Charge Reversal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) was developed for efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery or release of catalytic DNA circuitry probes via phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure, thus enabling the precisely space&#8208;controllable in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging.








Abstract
Catalytic DNA circuits have emerged as a powerful tool for high&#8208;performance biosensing application; however, the establishment of a safe and efficient in vivo delivery system remains a critical bottleneck. Peptides serve as attractive carriers due to their rich chemical diversity, excellent biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and specific binding ability, making them ideal candidates for the on&#8208;demand regulation of DNA circuits&#8212;yet remains largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) for the efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery and release of catalytic circuitry probes through a phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure. This ERP&#8208;programmed catalytic DNA circuit enables the precise, spatially controllable in vivo imaging of microRNA (miRNA). The multifunctional cationic peptide formed a stable nanocomplex with anionic DNA cargo via strong electrostatic interactions, thus protecting the DNA probes from degradation in biological environments. Moreover, with the ability to actively targeting tumor cells and facilitate endogenous phosphorylation&#8208;guided release of DNA probes, this multifunctional peptide could significantly reduce the nonspecific delivery of probes to healthy tissues, thereby minimizing unwanted off&#8208;site signal leakage. By the integration of cell&#8208;selective delivery and site&#8208;specific stimulation, this endogenously regulated and multiply guaranteed DNA circuit system paves a simple yet effective way for disease diagnosis.

         <title>Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx Species for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 activation on ZnO suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption, which impedes CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast, monodispersed ZnOx confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism, enabling H2 homolytic activation and CO2 hydrogenation at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal&#9472;H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303&#160;K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2&#8722;8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623&#8722;773&#160;K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723&#160;K over 150&#160;h. The established structure&#8208;performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual&#8208;site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Neighboring Carbon Defects Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation of Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts Toward Efficient Aerobic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular oxygen (O2) activation is crucial but challenging for aerobic reactions. By introducing neighboring carbon defects, the d&#8208;electron arrangement of cobalt single atom is regulated from low spin to high spin, enhancing O2 adsorption at cobalt site, resulting in the formation of more radicals &#183;O2&#8722; to achieve alcohol oxidation to acids and esters.








Abstract
The effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen (O2) is crucial for aerobic alcohol oxidation; however, flexibly modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to improve the capability remains challenging. Herein, the concentration of carbon defects surrounding the nitrogen&#8208;coordinated cobalt (Co) single atoms on candle soot is controlled just through adjusting the amount of polyethyleneimine which chemically decorates the surface of candle soot to anchor Co ions. The concentration increase of carbon defects boosts the aerobic alcohol oxidation over the Co single&#8208;atom catalyst as well as ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalyst. Moreover, a series of alcohols, including those with sensitive groups, reach an outstanding yield. Significantly, the calculations and experiments verify that the carbon defects lead to the rearrangement of d&#8208;orbitals of Co atom and an elevation in the spin states of dyz and dz2${{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{\mathrm{z}}}^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, compared with low&#8208;spin Co atom, the stronger electron&#8208;transfer interaction between high&#8208;spin Co atom and O2 enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and the generation of more superoxide radicals to promote alcohol oxidation. Our findings provide a new way for developing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for sustainable aerobic alcohol oxidation via manipulating the spin configurations of single atoms.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor via Increasing Interfacial Disorder to Inhibit Bimolecular Recombination for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule, CNDT, is introduced into the active layer and increases the disorder of electron donor/acceptor interfaces. It enhances the energy of the charge transfer state and leads to an uphill energy barrier for bimolecular recombination, reduces charge recombination rate/ratio and inhibits bimolecular recombination in OSCs. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO based OSCs featuring CNDT achieve arecord fill factor of 83.17% and an impressive PCE of 19.80%.








Abstract
The inferior fill factor (FF) is one of main reasons impeding further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). But no theoretical framework for high FFs has been established yet. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to enhance FFs via introducing a small molecule, CNDT, into active layer to increase electron donor/acceptor interface disorder, raise energy barrier for charge back transfer, and thus reduce bimolecular recombination rate constant (krec). CNDTs tend to distribute over donor/acceptor interfaces and disturb molecular stacking of Y6 to deliver more disordered donor/acceptor interfaces but higher crystal quality in the D18:Y6+ blend film, compared to D18:Y6. Altogether, in the D18:Y6+ blend film, a higher energy of charge transfer state magnifies energy barrier for charge recombination to decrease charge recombination rate/ratio and reduce krec, inhibiting bimolecular recombination in devices. Therefore, FFs of OSCs are improved from 75.78% (D18:Y6) to 81.13% (D18:Y6+), yielding a higher PCE of 19.45%. Moreover, D18:L8&#8208;BO+ based OSCs feature FFs over 83%, a record for OSCs so far. PCE increases subsequently to 19.80%. It demonstrates that increasing interface disorder without sacrificing crystal quality enhances energy barrier of charge recombination and inhibits bimolecular recombination to efficiently improve FFs for higher PCEs.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H Shift: Unlocking Migration along Coupling Partners in Olefin Borylcarbofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented migratory functionalization of olefins is reported, where migration occurs selectively along the coupling partner via a 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. Additionally, the integration of 1,2&#8208;Ni/H and 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shifts enables a two&#8208;fold migration, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#9472;H/C(sp2)&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling.








Abstract
Olefin migratory functionalization is a well&#8208;established strategy for the selective installation of functional groups at remote C(sp3)&#8722;H positions along an alkyl chain. However, prior research has predominantly focused on migration along the alkene component. Herein, we describe a conceptually new migratory coupling strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, where migration selectively occurs along the C(sp2) coupling partner rather than the alkene component, facilitated by a through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. This approach offers a modular three&#8208;component strategy for the selective and efficient construction of densely functionalized alkyl boronates from readily accessible chemicals. Moreover, by integrating the 1,2&#8208;Ni/H shift with the 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift, this platform has been expanded to achieve a two&#8208;fold migration along both the alkene components and the coupling partners, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#9472;H/C(sp2)&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Non&#8208;Precious Metal Catalysts with Gradient Oxidative Dual Sites Boost Bimolecular Activation for Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering highly active dual sites enhances catalytic oxidation reactions by optimizing bimolecular activation. By immobilizing Cu2+ on NO3&#8315;&#8208;grafted TiO2 and applying thermal treatment, Ti&#8208;doped CuO is successfully synthesized on a TiO2 support. This catalyst, featuring gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites, shows strong potential for low&#8208;temperature catalytic removal of NH&#8323; and various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for environmental applications.








Abstract
Catalytic oxidation emerges as a highly promising and cost&#8208;effective approach for eliminating gaseous pollutants, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial exhaust streams. However, achieving the simultaneous activation of O2 and substrate molecules at low temperatures using non&#8208;precious metal catalysts remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites that enhance bimolecular activation for catalytic oxidation reactions. The catalyst, Ti&#8208;doped CuO, is synthesized on a TiO2 support through the immobilization of Cu2&#8314; on NO3&#8315;&#8208;grafted TiO2, followed by thermal treatment. The resulting gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites exhibit exceptional catalytic oxidation activity for NH3 and various VOCs at low temperatures, matching the performance of precious metal&#8208;based catalysts. Notably, during NH&#8323; oxidation, Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti sites enhance the activation of both O&#8322; and NH&#8323;. HNO intermediates formed on Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti sites react with NH intermediates on neighboring Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites&#8212;producing N&#8322; and H&#8322;O via an imide mechanism&#8212;which effectively lowers the reaction barrier for catalytic NH&#8323; oxidation. As such, dual sites in non&#8208;precious metal catalysts show promising results for advancing future catalytic oxidation technologies.

         <title>Stepwise Crystallization Synthetic Strategy for Monodisperse InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots with Mid&#8208;Infrared Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stepwise crystallization synthetic strategy for monodisperse InSb colloidal QDs with mid&#8208;infrared absorption is proposed, generating QDs with unprecedented 5.8&#8211;22.2&#160;nm size range and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, InSb QDs with absorption wavelength extending 3000&#160;nm have been realized, a record among environmental&#8208;friendly QDs.








Abstract
Colloidal InSb quantum dots (QDs) are promising mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection materials due to their suitable bandgap, unparalleled room temperature electronic properties, environmental&#8208;friendly elemental composition, and facile solution processability. However, current InSb QDs suffer from limited spectral absorption within 2&#160;&#181;m, polydisperse QDs populations, and complex size&#8208;selective precipitation for further use, due to the lack of applicable growth theory and synthetic method. Here, we present a novel synthetic strategy for InSb QDs, which is featured by the initial formation of an amorphous intermediate and a subsequent stepwise crystallization process. This strategy enables the achievement of monodisperse InSb QDs with unprecedented 5.8&#8211;22.2&#160;nm size range, and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, we realize the synthesis of InSb QDs with absorption wavelength exceeding 3000&#160;nm, the record among the environmental&#8208;friendly QDs. The results presented here will pave the way toward environmental&#8208;friendly QDs as outstanding infrared optical and optoelectronic materials and push the frontier of solution&#8208;processed QDs into the mid&#8208;infrared regime applications.

         <title>Phthalocyanine Grafting Strategy Induces Strong Intrinsic Electric Fields and Molecule&#8208;Edge Carrier Transport Pathways for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy for optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands is presented through the development of a molecularly functionalized layer, 4EtCz&#8208;Pc, which is characterized by a strong dipole moment and a large internal electric field. This study introduces an efficient approach for facilitating charge carrier separation.








Abstract
Limited charge separation, slow charge mobility, and high electron&#8208;hole recombination rates remain critical challenges impeding the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. More regrettably, the charge transfer pathways within bulk charge transport are not yet fully understood, and the development of effective strategies to design these pathways remains a significant challenge. Herein, by optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands, we developed a molecularly functionalized layer, 4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;carbazole copper phthalocyanine (4EtCz&#8208;Pc), which is characterized by a strong dipole moment, a large internal electric field, and surprisingly positive electrostatic potential at the edge.

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy for optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands is presented through the development of a molecularly functionalized layer, 4EtCz-Pc, which is characterized by a strong dipole moment and a large internal electric field. This study introduces an efficient approach for facilitating charge carrier separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited charge separation, slow charge mobility, and high electron-hole recombination rates remain critical challenges impeding the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. More regrettably, the charge transfer pathways within bulk charge transport are not yet fully understood, and the development of effective strategies to design these pathways remains a significant challenge. Herein, by optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands, we developed a molecularly functionalized layer, 4-ethyl-carbazole copper phthalocyanine (4EtCz-Pc), which is characterized by a strong dipole moment, a large internal electric field, and surprisingly positive electrostatic potential at the edge. When integrated in conjunction with the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) and the semiconductor photoanode BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BVO), it forms a Co(OH)&#8322;/4EtCz-Pc/BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composite photoanode system. This innovative photoanode demonstrates an exceptional performance with continuous output for a duration of 15&#160;h. Additionally, a variety of advanced characterization methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) analyses, confirmed that 4EtCz-Pc significantly reduces the energy barrier for hole injection from the anode to the active layer during PEC catalysis. This study proposes an effective strategy to optimize the ligands grafted onto phthalocyanine, generating a strong internal electric field that facilitates the formation of new charge transport pathways within the photoanode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Oxide&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Design for Syngas Conversion by Reaction Phase Diagram Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalysis provides an approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) conversion, with oxides generating intermediates and zeolites catalyzing light olefin formation. Enhancing oxide activity remains a key challenge. We combined DFT calculations, reaction networks, reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis, and machine learning (ML) to predict high&#8208;performance catalysts. The results align with experiments, accelerating catalyst screening, and offering a versatile strategy for catalyst discovery.








Abstract
Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept provides an alternative approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) with superior selectivity. Enhancing the activity of oxide components remains a critical and long&#8208;pursued target in this field. However, rational design strategies for optimizing oxides and improving the catalyst performance in such complex reaction networks are still lacking. We employed energetic descriptors such as the adsorption energies of CO* and O* (GadCO* and GadO*) through reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis to predict the catalyst performance. The prediction was initially validated by the catalytic activity trends measured by experiments. Machine learning (ML) was further utilized to accelerate the screening of new catalysts. Ultimately, Bi&#8208;doped and Sb&#8208;doped ZnCrOx were theoretically predicted as optimized oxide candidates for the OXZEO reaction, which was experimentally verified to be more active than the currently best ZnCrOx counterpart. This work demonstrated enhanced OXZEO catalysts for STO as well as a research paradigm integrating theory and experiment to optimize bifunctional catalysts for complex reaction networks.

         <title>Vinyl&#8208;Functionalized Linear Alkyl Chains in Nonfullerene Acceptors Enable 19.2% Efficiency and Stable As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing acceptors geared toward efficient facilely processed OSCs is imperative for widespread commercialization. Herein, an alkyl linearization strategy was adopted to promote compact and face&#8208;on molecular stacking, and further vinyl functionalization of alkyl terminals provided additional interaction sites to manifest enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of BTP&#8208;V6, resulting in record PCEs of 19.2% and 20.1% for as&#8208;cast and optimal LBL OSCs, respectively.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) is imperative for alleviating costs and complexity for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Nevertheless, achieving the desired double&#8208;fibril morphology of active layer through single&#8208;step processing is challenging. Herein, two nonfullerene acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;N6 and BTP&#8208;V6, are designed and synthesized to construct as&#8208;cast OSCs by introducing linear alkyl chains adjacent to the pyrrole moiety. The reduction of steric hindrance attributable to linear chains engenders diminished dihedral angles of molecular skeletons, thereby promoting compact and face&#8208;on oriented molecular stacking. Moreover, BTP&#8208;V6 featuring vinyl&#8208;functionalized linear chains manifests additional interaction sites with neighboring molecules to instigate enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking during rapid film&#8208;formation process and engenders the formation of a refined double&#8208;fibril network morphology, which facilitates exciton dissociation, bolsters charge carrier transport, and suppresses recombination loss. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;V6 based device attained a record&#8208;shattering efficiency of 19.2% with a high fill factor (FF) of 80.7%, and also demonstrated robust thermal and shelf stability. Moreover, the meticulously optimized layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) structured devices achieved an excellent efficiency up to 20.1%. This study introduces a viable strategy for alkyl chain modification to fabricate efficient and stable as&#8208;cast devices, with the anticipation of expediting the progression toward widespread commercialization of OSCs.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Hydroallylation of Acrylates Enabled by &#947;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allyl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation of acylates under Cu/Pd synergistic catalysis is reported. The incorporation of a silyl group into allyl acetates precisely controls regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric hindrance. Subsequent transformation of the silyl group in the product enables the regioselective synthesis of allylated products bearing two distinct yet structurally similar aryl groups.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution provides an efficient route to chiral organic molecules featuring an allyl moiety, key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, the use of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl electrophiles has been severely constrained by the challenges of achieving both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity simultaneously. Herein, we present &#947;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allyl acetates as highly effective electrophiles for a regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation, enabling the construction of vicinal stereogenic centers. This method delivers allylated products in 44%&#8211;93% yield with 79:21 to &gt;95:5 dr and 88% to &gt;99% ee. Additionally, the silyl group in the products can be readily converted into other functional groups, such as acyl and aryl groups, enhancing their synthetic utility.

         <title>Catalytically Active Coacervates Sustained Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our findings demonstrate that simple building blocks can access active condensates by exploiting their own catalytic prowess that eventually helps in the realization of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium spatially confined state under open conditions. The active system, which catalyzes a metabolically relevant C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming reaction, conceptually foreshadows strategies for developing synthetic cells and also suggests their possible candidacy as the earliest protocells.








Abstract
Metabolically active membraneless organelles of extant biology have the capability to maintain their structure under nonequilibrium conditions by leveraging chemical reactions. Herein, we report active coacervates accessed via a mixture of minimal building blocks that featured &#960;&#8208;electron rich short peptide, positively charged aldehyde, and a cyclic ketone under nonequilibrium conditions. Peptide bound with the aldehyde by a dynamic covalent bond and demixed to form coacervates through hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, the short&#8208;peptide could utilize its free amine (&#946;&#8208;alanine) to catalyze C&#9472;C bond formation which eventually led to the depletion of one of the building blocks (aldehyde) via aldol reaction; an intrinsic catalytic role that helped the coacervate to suppress coalescence. Notably, under continuous additions (open system) of the depleting precursors, the active coacervates were able to demonstrate spatial stability for longer duration. This out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior of phase separated droplets in presence of flux of building blocks is reminiscent of the active membraneless organelles seen in contemporary biochemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion Transport in Ultrathin 3D Covalent Organic Framework Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work well manipulates the ion transport in nanoconfined channels by employing 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs). Owing to their continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics demonstrated high ionic flux and cation selectivity. Toward osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics output an ultrahigh power density of 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency ion transport is essential for both biological and nonbiological processes, including the regulation of cell homeostasis, energy conversion, and mass transfer in chemical industry. Nanofluidic channels are considered ideal platforms for delicate control of ion transport in their unique nanoconfinement, yet currently reported 1D and 2D nanofluidics are subjected to elevated transport resistance due to discontinuous and random channels. Here, we engineer ultrathin, 3D covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) nanofluidics featuring continuously interpenetrated pathways and well&#8208;ordered pore arrangements, demonstrating superior ion conductance. The energy barrier for ion transport across 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics is exceptionally low, suggesting ultrafast and low&#8208;resistance ion movements. Theoretical calculations indicate that 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics facilitate group adsorption to anions, leading to high energy barriers for anion mobility, thus enhancing ion selectivity and high&#8208;throughput cation transport. In osmotic energy applications, 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics achieve a power density of 217.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 with artificial seawater and river water, potentially scalable to 1238.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient. The proposed 3D&#8208;COF nanofluidics offer new avenues for desalination and ion/molecular separation.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Caged Hydrocarbons as Arenes Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality plays a crucial role in the biological interactions, safety, and effectiveness of drugs. The increasing use of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for planar benzene moieties in drug design has heightened the need for asymmetric catalysis strategies to produce chiral caged molecules. This minireview showcases recent progress in this rapidly growing research field. 








Abstract
The utilization of caged hydrocarbons as bioisosteres for arenes, especially the phenyl ring, in bioactive compounds has resulted in significant enhancements in potency, solubility, and metabolic stability. These improvements highlight the potential of C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds as a promising motif for the development of drug candidates. However, this strategy has also increased the structural complexity of these molecules, posing synthetic challenges in controlling the chirality of caged and highly decorated bioactive scaffolds. Over the past two years, remarkable progress has been achieved in catalytic asymmetric methodologies for the synthesis of caged hydrocarbons, significantly advancing their utility in chiral drug discovery and development. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent breakthroughs in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral caged hydrocarbons, encompassing bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes, cubanes, and related three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds. Additionally, we highlight the intriguing applications of enantiomerically pure caged hydrocarbons in biological studies. It is anticipated that this minireview will inspire further advancements in the enantioselective synthesis of these pharmaceutically valuable caged hydrocarbons.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;Like (Cyclo)Addition of Small Organic Molecules to a Stable Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azomethine ylide is shown to activate a series of H&#9472;E (E&#9552;B, Si, Al, O) and B&#9472;B bonds in &#8220;Frustrated Lewis pair&#8221; (FLP)&#8208;like fashion. A transfer hydrogenation from NH3&#8226;BH3 is also accomplished. DFT analyses suggest each activation route to be mechanistically distinct than others. The ylide also undergoes 3+2&#8208;cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles, among which the facile insertion of CS2 but non&#8208;insertion of CO2 is compelling but justified by computing the associated energetics.








Abstract
Azomethine ylides are 1,3&#8208;dipolar zwitterions typically used for constructing N&#8208;heterocycles by 3+2&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. We report here a pyridyl&#8208;tethered isolable azomethine ylide (AY) that activates a series of H&#8722;E bonds (E&#9552;B, Si, Al, O) in FLP&#8208;like fashion. The reactions are probed mechanistically by DFT calculations and each case appears to be distinct from others. While the HBpin activation is stepwise, the same of PhSiH3 is concerted. The AlH3 activation is also stepwise but takes place across the 1,5&#8208;(C+/N&#8722;) dipole. The hydrolysis of AY fits better with a &#8220;relay&#8221; mechanism with two H2O molecules working in tandem. The B&#8722;B bond of B2pin2 is also cleaved but in an intriguingly different way, by delivering both the Bpin moieties at the carbenic site. Though the challenging H2 activation fails, a transfer hydrogenation of AY by NH3&#8226;BH3 is readily achieved. AY also undergoes cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles including unactivated alkene and alkynes. In this regard, AY makes an interesting distinction between CO2 and CS2 by staying inert to the former but easily cycloadding the latter. DFT analysis justifies this dichotomy by showing the cycloaddition of CO2 as thermodynamically disfavored.

         <title>Mesoporous Enhanced Heterostructured Halide Solid Electrolytes with High Air Stability and High Abundance for Sustainable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorides and fluorides solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) exhibit&#160;contrasting extremes in ionic conductivity and moisture sensitivity. In light of these conflicting factors, we introduce a NaCl&#8208;based SE reinforced by mesoporous &#945;&#8208;AlF3&#160;(denoted as HS&#8208;AlF3), leading to a heterostructure halide architecture, designated as NHxy (where x/y represents the mass ratio of NaCl to HS&#8208;AlF3). The high dispersion of NaCl and HS&#8208;AlF3 during&#160;mechanochemical process enables the generation of defective and amorphous structures and nanodomains in NHxy along with F&#8208;Cl anion substitution effect at grain boundaries. These factors collectively promote&#160;Na&#8208;ion transport in NHxy, especially along the NaCl&#8208;based heterostructures with AlF3 and NaF. This class of SEs achieves high ionic conductivity approaching 10&#8208;4 S/cm at 30 &#176;C. Specifically, NH54 exhibits excellent long&#8208;term air stability at 35% relative humidity, maintaining high ion&#8208;conductivity without degradation. The raw material cost of this Na&#8208;based electrolyte is less than $10 USD/kg when considering the production in a large scale. The corresponding Na//Na symmetric cells demonstrate the stable cycling for at least 1000 h at 0.1 mA/cm2. The Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 cells assembled with the NH54 after air exposure exhibit the remarkable longevity, sustaining over 400 cycles at 60 &#176;C. The conversion&#8208;type Na/NH54/FeF3 cells deliver a high capacity of 500 mAh/g.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center of oxindoles is a crucial structural element of a broad spectrum of indole alkaloids, imparting these molecules with rigid three&#8208;dimensional configurations essential for their biological activities.

         <title>Pore engineering in isoreticular&#160;titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore engineering through chemical environment modification is vital for developing industrial porous materials. Understanding the effects of substitutions in isoreticular porous coordination&#8208;polymers&#8212;such as steric hindrance, vibrational capabilities, electronic influences, and hydropathy&#8212;is key to elucidating structure&#8208;property relationships. However, accurately assessing the impact of functional groups on properties remains challenging due to limitations in current methodologies. In this study, we designed a series of titanium&#8208;isophthalate coordination&#8208;polymers with various functional groups to regulate pore characteristics and structural dimensionality. The unique spatial arrangement and electronic distribution of isophthalate and its functional groups provide an ideal platform to address these challenges. We conducted extensive investigations combining experimental methods with computational simulations to explore how pore engineering affects adsorptive separation and photoresponsive behavior in these compounds. Our findings not only tackle the synthesis challenge of isostructural titanium&#8208;coordination polymers but also offer new insights into understanding structure&#8208;property relationships achieved through modulation of their chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Multi&#8208;interface Chemistry by Functional Carbon Dots for High&#8208;Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low ionic conductivity, poor mechanical strength and unstable interface structure are still the main factors hindering the practical application of polymer solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs).&#160; In this work, we have developed a unique composite filler (LLZTOCDs) for solid polymer electrolytes to address these challenges through synergistic regulation of multi&#8208;interface chemistry. The LLZTOCDs is prepared via thermal treatment of N, S, F&#8208;codoped carbon dots (NSFCDs) and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) inorganic electrolyte, here the detrimental Li2CO3 on the LLZTO surface is converted into a fast ion&#8208;conducting and an electron&#8208;insulating interlayer of LiF and Li3N, and the carbon dots self&#8208;assemble into a functional organophilic coating on the outermost layer, which acts as a bridge between the LLZTO and the polymer. This unique structure enhances the compatibility and ion&#8208;exchange kinetics between the LLZTOCDs and the polymer, significantly improving the mechanical strength and Li+ transport. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed in&#8208;situ at the LLZTOCDs interface provide an anion confinement effect, increasing lithium salt dissociation and enhancing the Li+ transference number to 0.85. Therefore, the solid battery constructed with LLZTOCDs exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;cycle life, and high ionic conductivity (1.96 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C), providing a feasible strategy for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Internal Exciton Confinement for Efficient CdZnSeS&#8208;Based Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdZnSeS/ZnS blue quantum dots were synthesized by growing a giant alloy CdZnSeS core with gradient composition and a low Fermi energy level position. The constructed blue quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLED) had a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24%, which is the highest value reported so far.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are thought to be the base for next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the performance of blue&#8208;emitting QLEDs still falls behind those of green and red ones, which can be attributed to the energy loss from Auger recombination and the strong coupling of excitons with surface states. Blue quantum dots (QDs) with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores are expected to improve the internal confinement of excitons due to the nonmonotonical energy landscape of their conduction band, while they haven't shown high performance in QLEDs due to insufficient optimization of their shell structures. In this work, giant CdZnSeS alloy cores were synthesized by diffusing Zn atoms into CdSeS cores, so that the core/shell lattice stress was released due to the optimized gradient compositions. As a result, exciton transfer and Auger recombination are both suppressed, leading to a breakthrough external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24% in blue QLEDs with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores. Compared to the more extensively studied blue quantum dots with CdSeZn alloy cores, blue QLEDs with giant CdZnSeS alloy cores also benefit from the suppressed Fermi level and nonmonotonical energy landscape of the conduction band minimum (CBM), which are crucial for confining the wavefunctions of the excitons. The improved exciton confinement explained the superior performances of giant CdZnSeS alloy cores over CdSeZn cores in blue QLEDs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer to suppress dendrite growth is an effective approach in Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries. Traditional SEI layers are limited by their simple structure and composition, enabling only one functionality of either providing nucleation sites or facilitating desolvation. In this study, a pulse guidance ion&#8208;accelerator is constructed by kinetics&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembling zincophilic micelles and zincophobic metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The closely packed soft micelles, in conjunction with the hard MOF host particles, form a multi&#8208;tiered soft&#8208;in&#8208;hard hetero&#8208;structure that accelerates adsorption, pre&#8208;desolvation, and subsequent desolvation processes, facilitating the (002) crystal plane dendrite&#8208;free deposition. As a result, stable cycling over 1900 hours (31 mV polarization) in symmetric cell and 5200 cycles in the Zn//Cu battery (99.8% coulombic efficiency) can be achieved. These findings will effectively promote the development of stable and long&#8208;cycling aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Based &#8220;Transfer Stations&#8221; at Carbon&#8208;Immobilized Metal Particles Enable Rapid Hydrogen Transfer for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction of surface metal species with the solution plays a key role in engineering heterogeneous catalytic processes. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of L&#8208;histidine&#8208;coordinated PdAg nanoparticles (4.03 &#177; 0.08 nm) anchored on pristine carbon supports (denoted as PdAg&#8208;NH2/C) and their use for formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD). Significant acceleration of FAD related to the histidine is observed, and the enhancement mechanism is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The presence of L&#8208;histidine at metal sites promotes rapid binding of formic acid molecules due to acid&#8208;base interactions. The local enrichment of both proton and formate at the metal&#8208;solution interfaces promotes the subsequent formate decomposition and hydride transfer to the metal surface. The as&#8208;generated surface H species are more concentrated compared to the previously reported catalyst where the metal is loaded on an amino&#8208;modified support, this enabling a significantly enhanced H2 production. The optimal Pd1Ag1&#8208;NH2/C catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency of 6493.5 h&#8208;1 at 333 K based on the total amount of Pd, together with a H2 selectivity of 100%. This study emphasizes the critical role of optimizing local transport pathways near catalytic centers chemically and further provide insights to the rational development of heterogeneous catalysts for FAD technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic C&#8208;N Coupling for Efficient Cyclohexanone Oxime Syn&#8208;thesis from Ambient Air by Supported Molecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unravelling atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanism and managing selective C&#8208;N coupling pose great challenges to realize considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C&#8208;N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. Herein, molecular catalysts are demonstrated unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e. iron bis(pyridyl)&#8208;bipyridineamine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2&#8208; and cyclohexanone, attaining mass&#8208;specific efficiency of 87.00 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 mgcat&#8208;1, FE of 77.3 % and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H&#8208;cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2&#8208;, and catalyzed selective NO2&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH reduction for C&#8208;N bond in&#8208;situ. Further integrating plasma&#8208;driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 mgcat&#8208;1 on FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton&#8208;1, much lower than the breakeven point (~$10000 ton&#8208;1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from rich nitrogen resources is a promising alternative to traditional industrial processes. However, the difficulties in unravelling atomic-scale catalytic mechanism and managing selective C-N coupling pose great challenges to realize considerable yield and selectivity, and therefore rational catalyst design to boost collaborative C-N coupling for oxime synthesis is particularly attractive. Herein, molecular catalysts are demonstrated unique for oxime synthesis under mild conditions, i.e. iron bis(pyridyl)-bipyridineamine (FeBPAbipyH) modified MWCNTs@CP cathodes produced cyclohexanone oxime from NO2- and cyclohexanone, attaining mass-specific efficiency of 87.00 mg h-1 cm-2 mgcat-1, FE of 77.3 % and exclusive carbon selectivity, which is the best efficiency known to date in H-cell. Mechanistic studies showed that the FeBPAbipyH molecular skeleton exhibited intimate interaction with both cyclohexanone and NO2-, and catalyzed selective NO2--to-NH2OH reduction for C-N bond in-situ. Further integrating plasma-driven N2 oxidation and electrocatalysis enabled cyclohexanone oxime formation at 61.73 mg h-1 cm-2 mgcat-1 on FeBPAbipyH/MWCNTs@CP electrode and the whole synthetic and separation process is projected profitable with a promising cost of $2709 ton-1, much lower than the breakeven point (~$10000 ton-1), representing a sustainable pathway to nitrogenous chemical synthesis from abundant resources under ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable Nanoparticle Conversion Pathway to Monodisperse Polyelemental High Entropy Alloy, Intermetallic, and Multiphase Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyelemental nanoparticles (PE NPs), those consisting of four or more elements, exhibit unique properties from synergistic compositional effects. Examples include high entropy alloys, high entropy intermetallics, and multiphase types, including Janus and core&#8208;shell architectures. While colloidal syntheses offer excellent structural control for mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;elemental compositions, achieving the same control for PE NPs remains challenging. Here, this challenge is addressed with a NP conversion strategy wherein different types of PE NPs &#8211; including high entropy alloy, high entropy intermetallic, and multi&#8208;phase Janus nanoparticles &#8211; are achieved through thermal transformation of readily synthesized colloidal core&#8208;shell NPs. Through systematic variations in stoichiometry and metal identity to the core&#8208;shell precursor NPs, along with atomistic simulations that probe phase stabilities, the final mixing states of the various NPs are found to be governed by the balance between the enthalpy and entropy of mixing. Our annealing method allows&#160;intermediate states of mixing to be trapped, creating distinct surface ensembles that were evaluated as catalysts. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report colloidally derived precursor NPs enabling the synthesis of all types of PE NPs in a single process. This NP conversion strategy offers a general route to diverse PE NPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unnatural Triggers Converted from Tetrazine&#8208;Attached Sialic Acid for Activation of Optoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing chemical groups on cell membranes through metabolic glycoengineering of unnatural sugars is an effective means to solve the issue of insufficient or even lack of targets in cancer theranostics. Herein, we address the limitations by developing a tetrazine precursor (SiaTz) based on a non&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated sialic acid scaffold and then utilizing it to create unnatural tetrazine triggers on the surface of cancer cells. SiaTz exhibits a good balance between the stability and reaction kinetics under physiological conditions and can be efficiently converted into corresponding tetrazine trigger through bypassing several size&#8208;limiting steps in metabolic glycoengineering process. We also prepare a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept theranostic combination of a trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivative (CyTCO) and a thermal&#8208;sensitive drug 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane]&#8208;dihydrochloride (AIPH) to verify the activation function of tetrazine triggers in theranostics of orthotopic and metastatic tumors. In the presence of tetrazine triggers, CyTCO can be activated via bioorthogonal reaction to induce optoacoustic signal enhancement, enabling high&#8208;contrast diagnostic imaging and precise tumor localization to guide subsequent treatments. Tetrazine trigger&#8208;activated CyTCO displays high photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, which can cause an obvious increase in temperature under laser irradiation and then initiate AIPH decomposition to produce toxic radicals for combined therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Multifunctionalities into a Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is still challenging. Herein, integrating nitrogen&#8208;rich organic cages and the photoactive porphyrin moieties together, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF), Cage&#8208;PorCOF, is successfully synthesized. After incorporating metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) into the cage&#8208;based COF, Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) are subsequently constructed for the CO2 photoreduction. Catalytic experiments show impressive performance in CO2 photoreduction with CO generation rates of up to 48,748 and 28,446 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the first initiating hour for Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Co) and Cage&#8208;PorCOF(Ni) respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from CO2&#8208;affinity of the porous frameworks and incorporated metal atoms, the light&#8208;absorption and charge separation ability of metalloporphyrin groups as well as the fully exposed single&#8208;atomic catalytic sites confirmed by both experimental and theoretical analyses. This study demonstrates that by the integration of multiple functionalities into 3D porous solids, highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 conversion can be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced "Proton Fence Effect" Enables Selectivity Switching Between CH4 and CO in Photo&#8208;Assisted CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling CO2 into high&#8208;value C1 products is impressive for achieving carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, while rational modulation of C1 product selectivity is one of the biggest challenges in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) due to the competing reaction pathways and thermodynamic limitation. Here, we showcase a &#8216;proton fence&#8217; strategy enabled by in situ adsorbed *OH on sulfur vacancies (SV) to ultraselectively switch the C1 product between CH4 and CO during CO2RR, with Faraday efficiency of 93.6% and 95.3%, respectively. In situ measurements uncover that the photo&#8208;generated holes counteract Cu2+ electroreduction to retain the intact structure of CuInS2/CuS, while *OH dissociated from water can spontaneously anchor toward SV to hinder the local proton migration, completely circumventing multiproton products. Meanwhile, the preferential desorption of *CO from Cu centers adjacent to the *OH&#8208;anchored SV renders the exclusive formation of CO. In the absence of SV, *CO can be further hydrogenated in a lower free energy/even spontaneously to afford CH4. The proposed proton confinement effect furnishes a promising reference for the selectivity control of eCO2RR, and the photo&#8208;assisted electroreductive protocol demonstrates a paradigm of in situ stabilization of electron&#8208;intolerant catalytic structures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aesthetic Platonic solids have been known since ancient times and the structure of all five Platonic solids are also found in chemical compounds. While gold sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and gold nanoparticles with an icosahedral structure have been known for a long time, a multi&#8208;shell icosahedral gold cluster at the intermediate size between 13 and thousands of atoms has been elusive. Here we present the synthesis and crystallographic characterization of the first three&#8208;shell icosahedral metal cluster, Au147(SPh)30(PPh3)121. The gold core in 1 is stabilized by phosphines and thiolates, but surprisingly no staple motifs are formed. A second cluster, Au146(SPh)30(PPh3)122, cocrystallizes and is identified as having a closed electronic shell, but can be considered as a geometrically open pendant of 1. The unique clusters are characterized experimentally by EDX, UV/Vis, DLS, EPR, and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Activities of CYP152 Peroxygenases towards Non&#8208;carboxylic Substrates Reveal Novel Substrate Recognition Mechanism and Catalytic Versatility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring and exploiting the catalytic promiscuity of enzymes is a central topic and captivating challenge in enzymology. CYP152 peroxygenases are attractive biocatalysts for diverse reactions under mild conditions using H2O2 as cofactor. However, their substrate scope is limited by a carboxyl group required for substrate assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis, following the well&#8208;accepted principle that heme&#8208;dependent H2O2&#8208;utilizing enzymes employ a carboxyl group within their active sites to facilitate H2O2 activation. Herein, we reveal for the first time that several CYP152 family members can directly degrade various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group, exhibiting novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities. Through crystal structure analysis, isotope tracing experiments, and QM/MM calculations, we elucidate that the phenolic hydroxyl group activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent(s) functionally replaces the carboxyl group, forming hydrogen bonds with the conserved arginine leading to Compound I formation. The oxygen atom of the newly formed hydroxyl group originates from water, bypassing the conventional oxygen rebound step. These findings provide first insights into the mechanisms of P450 peroxygenases towards non&#8208;carboxylic substrates, expanding our knowledge of biological C&#8208;H activation and C&#8208;halogen bond cleavage beyond canonical P450 reactions. This discovery holds immense potential for harnessing these enzymes in innovative strategies for industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable and Ultrathin Dual Entangled Network Polymer Electrolytes for Safe Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying ultrathin and flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance is crucial for scale&#8208;up production of solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) metal batteries (SSMBs). However, the challenges of poor processing scalability, insufficient intrinsic mechanical strength, and limited ionic transport capacity remain unaddressed. Herein, an ultrathin 9.7 &#956;m solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane featuring a dual&#8208;polymer entangled network is meticulously engineered through an arrayed multi&#8208;nozzle electrospinning technique with a swelling&#8208;hot pressing process using polyacrylonitrile and poly(ether&#8208;block&#8208;amide), which exhibits an exceptional voltage tolerance, enhanced tensile strength, and superior thermal stability. The soft ether oxygens segments in multiblock copolymers complex with Na+ to promote the rapid hopping transport of Na+. Meanwhile, interconnected electronegative channels based on carbonyl and cyanogen groups serve as Na+ conduits to smooth ion fluctuations and accelerate Na+ selective conduction simultaneously. The obtained inorganic&#8208;organic composite solid electrolyte interface with the improved mechanical strength of ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolytes effectively suppresses Na dendrites with low overpotential over 500 h. The solid&#8208;state cells paired with layered oxides deliver a capacity retention of over 91.1% between 25 &#176;C and 65 &#176;C, and assembled pouch cells exhibit impressive energy density over 100 cycles, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale application of ultrathin structure in the SSMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism for Unconventional Anodic Reaction of Aldehyde&#160;Oxidation for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anodic reactions&#160;involving non&#8208;faradaic&#160;process&#160;has significantly expanded the potential application of anodic&#160;oxidation half&#8208;reactions.&#160;Metallic Cu&#160;materials can catalyze an unconventional anodic aldehyde&#160;oxidation&#160;reaction involving the non&#8208;faradaic&#160;H2&#160;production (AOR&#8208;H2). AOR&#8208;H2&#160;has distinct advantages of ultra&#8208;low thermodynamic potentials and high value&#8208;added redox products, etc., but the question of exactly how reduction steps occur during AOR&#8208;H2, is something which has long puzzled scientists. Here we illustrate the novel synergistic mechanism&#160;of non&#8208;electrochemical/electrochemical redox steps in AOR&#8208;H2. Aldehyde undergoes hydration, deprotonation, and spontaneous C&#8208;H homolytic cleavage to generate H2, and then is electrochemically oxidized to form carboxylate. Decorating Cu catalysts with metallic&#160;Pt species, supported by theoretical calculations, leads to a twelvefold increase in the intrinsic activity&#160;of AOR&#8208;H2.&#160;This work&#160;inspires&#160;researchers&#160;to&#160;develop novel&#160;cathodic and anodic reactions&#160;involving the non&#8208;faradaic&#160;process&#160;for breaking through the limit&#160;of&#160;existing&#160;energy conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Staggered ABC&#8208;Stacking Cobalt&#8208;Triptycene Framework for Accelerating CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks are highly efficient photocatalysts due to their highly tunable structures and favorable electronic properties. However, achieving control over framework stacking arrangements, such as the staggered ABC&#8208;stacking, presents significant challenges. This difficulty arises from the inherently unfavorable energetics of the ABC arrangement and weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions compared to other stacking modes. Herein, a cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework with a staggered ABC&#8208;stacking arrangement was successfully synthesized in the aqueous phase, achieving a 90% yield. Experimental evaluations revealed that this framework achieved a CO production rate of 4.43 mmol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, which is comparable to the most reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Moreover, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the ABC&#8208;stacking cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework exhibits lower activation energy (0.079 eV) for water molecules, reduced Gibbs free energies for key intermediates *COOH (0.76 eV) and *H (0.73 eV), and the highest reaction rate increment (7.488 times). Furthermore, principal component analysis reveals a strong correlation between the CO production rate and factors such as the Ik value, optical bandgap, and &#916;G*H, revising the previous held notion that &#916;G*COOH is the primary determinant of catalytic performance. These results offer valuable insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Transaminase&#8208;Triggered Cascades for the Synthesis and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to complex indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids is described that relies on transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael methodology. In one case, a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction enables dynamic kinetic resolution.








Abstract
Biocatalysis is now a well&#8208;established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone into an amine or alcohol, and do not result in the generation of significant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme&#8208;triggered reaction cascade methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3&#8208;rich molecules in one step. Herein, we describe a single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to high&#8208;value, complex indolizidine, and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies on a transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural&#8208;product&#8208;like N&#8208;heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N&#8208;heterocycles and where a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3&#8208;rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.

         <title>Efficient Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules with Exceptional Diurnal Stability Through Asymmetric Interaction Induced by Symmetric Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetric molecular structure of 4FY has been shown to induce an &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221;, which promotes a higher degree of molecular packing than in Y6. The asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area semitransparent organic solar modules that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions. 








Abstract
The symmetry&#8208;breaking design strategy of nonfullerene acceptor can improve the performance of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs). However, no report exists on the &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221; induced by symmetric molecular structure in nonfullerene acceptors. Herein, we showcase that 2D fluorophenyl outer groups in symmetric 4FY promote dipole&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly through asymmetric molecular interactions, resulting in a tighter packed structure than Y6 with the same symmetric geometry. Such unique properties lead to high&#8208;performance layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs, accompanied by simultaneously reduced energy and recombination losses and improved charge&#8208;related characteristics. ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY achieve notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.81%, average visible transmittance of 45.43%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.91%. Moreover, exceptional diurnal cycling stability is observed in the ST&#8208;OSCs based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY with much prolonged T80 up to 134&#160;h, which is about 17 times greater than the reference PCE10&#8208;2F/Y6. Lastly, we fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar modules based on PCE10&#8208;2F/4FY (active area of 18 cm2), which shows PCE of 6.78% and the highest LUE of 3.10% to date for all&#8208;narrow bandgap semitransparent organic solar modules. This work demonstrates that asymmetry&#8208;driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large&#8208;area ST&#8208;OSCs that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The symmetric molecular structure of 4FY has been shown to induce an &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221;, which promotes a higher degree of molecular packing than in Y6. The asymmetry-driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large-area semitransparent organic solar modules that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions. 

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symmetry-breaking design strategy of nonfullerene acceptor can improve the performance of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs). However, no report exists on the &#8220;asymmetric molecular interaction&#8221; induced by symmetric molecular structure in nonfullerene acceptors. Herein, we showcase that 2D fluorophenyl outer groups in symmetric 4FY promote dipole-driven self-assembly through asymmetric molecular interactions, resulting in a tighter packed structure than Y6 with the same symmetric geometry. Such unique properties lead to high-performance layer-by-layer OSCs, accompanied by simultaneously reduced energy and recombination losses and improved charge-related characteristics. ST-OSCs based on PCE10-2F/4FY achieve notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.81%, average visible transmittance of 45.43%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.91%. Moreover, exceptional diurnal cycling stability is observed in the ST-OSCs based on PCE10-2F/4FY with much prolonged &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; up to 134&#160;h, which is about 17 times greater than the reference PCE10-2F/Y6. Lastly, we fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar modules based on PCE10-2F/4FY (active area of 18 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which shows PCE of 6.78% and the highest LUE of 3.10% to date for all-narrow bandgap semitransparent organic solar modules.

         <title>Molecule Differentiation Encoding Microscopy to Dissect Dense Biomolecules in Cellular Nanoenvironments below Spatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers is reported to digitize the dense biomolecules below spatial resolution. The method encodes each copy of the same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It transforms the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra, overcoming the common challenge of optical crowding.








Abstract
Cellular biomolecules may exhibit dense distribution and organization at the nanoscale to govern vital biological processes. However, it remains a common challenge to digitize the spatially dense biomolecules under the spatial resolution of microscopies. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle method, molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers is reported, to resolve the copy numbers of dense biomolecules in cellular nanoenvironments. The method encodes each copy of the same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It can transform the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to automatically quantitate overlapping spots and individual spots. Using this method, RNAs in the cytoplasm, DNA epigenetic modifications in the cell nucleus, and glycans and glycoRNAs on the cell surface are dissected, respectively. It is found that all these biomolecules present dense distribution with diverse degrees in crowded cellular nanoenvironments. Especially, an average 17% copies of U1 glycoRNA of single cells are gathered in various nano environments on the cell surface. The strategy provides a powerful tool for digitally quantitative visualization of dense biomolecules below the spatial resolution of microscopies and can provide insights into underlying functions and mechanisms of the dense distribution information.

         <title>Oxidative Rearrangements of the Alkaloid Intermediate Geissoschizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19E&#8208;geissoschizine is a key precursor in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Using enzymatic assays and gene silencing, three CYPs were identified from C. roseus that oxidize this compound to four alkaloid scaffolds: strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline, and mavacurane. Mutational analysis reveals how active&#8208;site changes fine&#8208;tune product specificity, highlighting nature's strategy for metabolic diversity.








Abstract
Plants can generate structural diversity by enzymatic rearrangement of a central intermediate. 19E&#8208;geissoschizine is one such chemically versatile intermediate that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine, and vinblastine. Here we report how 19E&#8208;geissoschizine undergoes oxidative transformations to generate four distinct alkaloid scaffolds through the action of three biosynthetic enzymes. Using in vitro enzymatic assays and gene silencing, we demonstrate how these three cytochrome P450 enzymes in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus transform 19E&#8208;geissoschizine into strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline&#8208;type, and mavacurane&#8208;type alkaloids. We use mutational analysis to show how minimal changes to the active site of these similar enzymes modulate product specificity. This work highlights how substrate reactivity and enzyme mutations work synergistically to generate chemical diversity.

         <title>A Bench&#8208;Stable Fluorophosphine Nickel(0) Complex and Its Catalytic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein present the synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable Ni(0) complex, [Ni(PFPh2)4], stabilized by vastly underexplored fluorophosphine ligands. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Kumada&#8208;Tamao&#8208;Corriu cross&#8208;coupling reactions as well as in Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig C&#9472;N bond formation reactions, indicates its promising potential as alternative to conventional Ni(0) sources.








Abstract
We herein present a fluorophosphine&#8208;based nickel(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] (1), which is highly stable in air and water. [Ni(PFPh2)4] can be obtained from a one&#8208;pot reaction of [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 with Ph2P(&#9552;O)&#8211;PPh2, involving a unique in situ reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) and a simultaneous fluorination by the BF4&#8722; anion. This complex does not only incorporate a nickel center in the zero&#8208;oxidation state, resulting from a Ni(II) precursor, but also includes fluorophosphine ligands, which typically disproportionate immediately in solution. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] as highly stable Ni(0) pre&#8208;catalyst in combination with additional phosphine ligands, such as dppf (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene), in various coupling reactions uncovers its high catalytic activity and versatility, which is superior to [Ni(COD)2] (COD&#9552;cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene) as conventional Ni(0) source.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Synthesis of Sulfonic Acid Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#9472;C bond linked COF have synthesized through the photothermal catalysis under visible light, which can be a photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. A new photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven postsynthetic strategy has been developed to construct COFs via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation, the COF showing an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of benzylamine.








Abstract
Although photothermal catalysis is a clean, efficient, and green approach to access organic products, its application in the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains unprecedented. Herein, we report the photothermal catalytic synthesis of C&#9472;C bond linked COF under visible light, which can be a reusable photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. Furthermore, we have developed a new postsynthetic modification strategy to construct COFs by photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven hydroamination via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. The obtained COF containing sulfonic acid group showed an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes under mild reaction conditions. These results not only enrich the COF synthetic methodology but also open a new route to access COFs in a green and sustainable way.

         <title>Adaptive Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S Clusters: Consistent Redox Behavior versus Reversible Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are critical in a number of important biological processes, where their structural integrity can be maintained or reversibly transformed. However, it remains ambiguous how Fe&#8208;S clusters adapt to electrochemical demands for electron transport through redox&#8208;induced structural transformations. In this study, three Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;S clusters comprising similar or distinct cores with [Mo2Fe2] metal centers in different oxidation states have been synthesized. These chemically interconvertible clusters exhibit strikingly similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, irrespective of the structural differences in the core. Subsequent investigations indicate that the chloride ligand in cluster 2 is spontaneously replaced by the solvent molecule in solution and therefore only the solvent&#8208;ligated species exhibits an observable redox behavior that is almost identical to that of the chloride&#8208;free clusters 3 and 4. A comprehensive analysis of the redox behavior suggests that the intriguing redox events in the CV curves can be correlated to the electrochemical transformations between the chloride&#8208;free clusters. This work provides an insight into how Fe&#8208;S clusters maintain a stable redox behavior through structural transformations that can facilitate electron transfer in certain cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Filler with Anion&#8208;Constrained Centers in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries based on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is hindered by their low Li+ conductivity and safety risks posed by the growth of lithium dendrites. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we designed a cationic porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;142) and introduced it as a filler into SPEs to obtain a composite polymer electrolyte&#160;(CPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;CPE. The cationic imidazolium sites could effectively constrain the movement of anions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the design of the imidazolium&#8208;based building units allowed the cationic sites to be located within the framework, which promoted the transport of Li+. Density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which PAF&#8208;142 promoted the dissociation of lithium salts and enhanced Li+ transport.&#160;Benefiting from these advantages, the Li+ conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte&#160;(QCPE), PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE reached 8.77&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 20 &#176;C. Additionally, a stable interface with abundant inorganic&#160;components was formed between PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE and the lithium electrode, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, thereby achieving stable long cycle of the Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//Li cell for more than 8500 h. The Li//PAF&#8208;142&#8208;QCPE//LFP cell demonstrated excellent cycle life exceeding 1400 cycles. This study proposes a promising SPEs performance&#8208;enhancing solution, advancing cutting&#8208;edge lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Temporary Structural Supports for Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The range of functional proteins that can be prepared by chemical protein synthesis includes those bearing complex modifications and incorporating D&#8208;amino acids, and exceeds what can be accessed by biological means, but the technique is still limited by the unfavorable solution behavior of many synthetic protein intermediates in buffer, leading to inefficient ligation, purification, and in vitro folding. One approach to address this limitation is the use of temporary structural supports &#8212; chemical modifications, usually solubilizing functionalities such as polyamines or carbohydrates &#8212; that are installed on either the backbone or side chains of the synthetic intermediates and removed at a later stage of chemical protein synthesis. The basic processes for introducing and removing such temporary structural supports are reminiscent of the canonical protecting groups ubiquitous in organic chemistry. However, unlike the synthesis of small organic molecules, where solubility is rarely an issue, the purpose of temporary structural supports is to modulate the solution behavior of the synthetic intermediates. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of temporary structural supports for chemical protein synthesis and organize them into three categories: 1) Supports to improve solubility; 2) Supports to assist chemical ligation; and 3) Supports to promote folding.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C with High&#8208;Density Atomically Dispersed Mn Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts as alternatives presents an attractive solution for enhancing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and reducing costly platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Manganese&#8208;based nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C) is anticipated to exhibit durability due to its weaker Fenton reaction propensity. However, a key obstacle lies in boosting intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and increasing the density of Mn active sites, crucial for practical integration into fuel cell operations. Herein, a three&#8208;step method is developed to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C materials with a rich mesoporous structure as highly effective ORR catalysts. The high Mn loading (3.42 wt%) promotes the generation of Duo&#8208;MnN4 active sites, demonstrating outstanding performance and durability for fuel cells. Specifically, the exceptional performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) reaches 649 mW cm&#8722;2 and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC) achieves 770 mW cm&#8722;2. Notably, the durability of the Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst in PEMFC is reported for the first time, showing only an 18.4 % decay after 30,000 square&#8208;wave cycles. This work provides a unique perspective and a systematic design strategy for building feasible nonprecious metal catalysts with a high active site density, addressing the challenges of inefficiency and performance limitations across various electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Hydrogen Bond Mediated Mass Transfer toward Industrial Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid migration of reactive ions across the electrolyte&#8211;catalytic sites interface is crucial in various catalytic processes. Herein, we introduce hydrogen bond to bridge the intrinsic gap at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface, mediating the diffusion of hydroxide ions. We implemented the aforementioned concept by a library of oxyanions functionalized NiCo OOH, wherein the oxygen atom within the oxyanions established hydrogen bond with H2O molecules in the electrolyte. Operando spectroscopy indicated that both water electrolysis activity and hydroxide concentration exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped dependence on the electrostatic potential of functionalized group, which formulated the electrostatic potential as descriptors to guide the design of interfacial hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated catalysis. The sulfate&#8208;modified NiCo OOH achieved an ultralow energy consumption of 4.23 kWh m&#8208;3H2 in the industrial electrolyzers, predicting that the electricity consumption can be reduced by 16,000 TWh.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3CH2OH conversion comprising atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu4) and single Cu sites coordinated with 2N and O anchored on two&#8208;step calcinated C3N4 (Cu4/Cu1@CN) is reported. It was found to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to ethanol with production rate of 154 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98%, the yield rate and selectivity exceed most of the reported results for ethanol production. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that the high efficiency of this catalyst arises from the strong synergy beween Cu4 clusters and adjacent Cu single atoms, which facilitates OC&#8722;CO coupling and promotes ethanol production.</dc:description>

Mg[HexCB11Cl11]2 (1), prepared by reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][HexCB11Cl11], consists, in the solid state, of a central Mg2+ surrounded by two [HexCB11Cl11]&#8208; anions. In solution, experimental and molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) agree with cation/anion association being retained reflecting the high electrophilicity of the Mg center. Yet, reflecting weak anion/cation interactions, species 1 polymerizes 1&#8208;hexene and coordinates alkynes. However, 1 displays no reaction with HSiEt3 at room temperature, consistent with a low hydridicity of the hard (HSAB) Mg2+ center. Contrasting with 1 (FIA = 264 kJ mol&#8208;1; FIA: Fluoride Ion Affinity), salt Mg[(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]2 (2), incorporating the more basic ammoniododecaborate [(nBu)3NB12H4Cl7]&#8208; anion, is&#160; less Lewis acidic (FIA = 214.7 kJ mol&#8208;1) and unreactive with alkenes/alkynes. Salt 1 effectively catalyzes alkene/alkyne hydrosilylation via an initial alkene/alkyne coordination/initiation, as suggested by experimental and computational data. It does also efficiently catalyze (with a catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol%) the hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of HSiEt3. Salt 1 promotes the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, and it is an active imine hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of H2.</dc:description>
