      <title>Micro&#8208;Lensed Fiber Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals Subcellular Distribution of Drugs within Single Cells</title>
      <dc:description>The visualization of temporal and spatial changes in the intracellular environment has great significance for chemistry and bioscience research. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is playing an increasingly important role in this field because of its unique advantages, such as being label&#8208;free and high throughput, yet it remains a great challenge for laser&#8208;based techniques due to limited lateral resolution. Here, we develop a simple, reliable and economic nanoscale MSI approach by introducing desorption laser with a micro&#8208;lensed fiber. Using this integrated platform, we achieved 300 nm resolution MSI and successfully visualized the distribution of various small&#8208;molecule drugs in subcellular locations. Moreover, exhaustive dynamic processes of anticancer drugs, including releasing from nanoparticle carriers entering nucleus of cells, can be readily acquired on an organelle scale. Considering the simplicity and universality of this nanoscale desorption device, it could be easily adapted to most of laser&#8208;based mass spectrometry applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Solution&#8208;state aggregation of conjugated polymers is critical in determining their solid&#8208;state microstructures and optoelectronic performance. However, controlling the solution&#8208;state aggregation of conjugated polymers for producing specific microstructures remains challenging. Herein, a practical approach is developed to finely tune the solid&#8208;state microstructures through temperature&#8208;controlled solution&#8208;state aggregation and polymer crystallization. High temperature generates significant conformation fluctuation of conjugated backbones in solution, which facilitates the polymer crystallization from solvated aggregates to orderly&#8208;packed structures. The polymer films deposited at high temperatures exhibit less structural disorders and higher electron mobilities (up to two orders of magnitude) in field&#8208;effect transistors, compared to those deposited at low temperatures. This work provides an effective strategy to tune the solution&#8208;state aggregation to reveal the relationship between solution&#8208;state aggregation and solid&#8208;state microstructures of conjugated polymers, which could accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance polymer optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Methanol assisted autocatalysis in catalytic methanol synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic methanol synthesis is one of the major processes in the chemical industry and may grow in importance, as methanol produced from CO2 and sustainably derived H2 is envisioned to play an important role as energy carrier in a future low CO2 emission society. However, despite the widespread use, the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites are not fully understood. Here we report that methanol synthesis at commercially applied conditions using the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is dominated by a methanol&#8208;assisted, autocatalytic reaction mechanism. We propose that the presence of methanol opens for hydrogenation of surface formate via methyl formate. Autocatalytic acceleration of the reaction is also observed for Cu supported on SiO2 although with low absolute activity, but not for Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. The results illustrate an important example of autocatalysis in heterogeneous catalysis and pave the way for further understanding, improvements and process optimization of industrial methanol synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>A Short&#8208;Lived but Highly Cytotoxic Vanadium(V) Complex as a Potential Drug Lead for Brain Cancer Treatment by Intratumoral Injections</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the clinical success of Pt anti&#8208;cancer drugs, metal&#8208;based drugs are slow to enter the clinic, due to their coordination chemistry and typically short lifetimes in biological environments. We propose that this can be turned into advantage for direct injections into the tumor, which will allow use of highly cytotoxic drugs. The release of their less toxic decomposition products into the blood will lead to reduced systemic toxicity and can even have beneficial effect, such as the neurostimulatory activity of vanadium. &#160;In particular, a ternary V(V) complex, 1 ([VOL1L2], where L1 is N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine, and L2 is 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol), enters cells intact to induce high cytotoxicity in a range of human cancer cells, including T98g (glioma multiforme), while its decomposition products in cell culture medium were ~8&#8208;fold less toxic. Complex 1 was 12&#8208;fold more toxic than cisplatin in T98g cells, and 6&#8208;fold more toxic in T98g cells than in a non&#8208;cancer human cell line, HFF&#8208;1. Its high toxicity in T98g cells was retained in the presence of physiological concentrations of the two main metal&#8208;binding serum proteins, albumin and transferrin. These properties favour further development of 1 for brain cancer treatment by intratumoral injections.</dc:description>

      <title>Diradical organic one&#8208;dimensional polymers synthesized on a metallic surface</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of radical polymers with control over chemical composition and structure is a milestone in materials science and has re&#8208;emerged recently because of the development of new synthetic methods to produce stable radical organic compounds. However, their synthesis is remarkably challenging due to the inherent reactivity induced by the presence of unpaired electrons in their structure. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of atomically precise one&#8208;dimensional diradical peripentacene polymers on a Au(111) surface. By means of high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy complemented by theoretical simulations, we provide an evidence of their magnetic properties, which arise from the presence of two unpaired spins at their termini. In addition, we probe a transition of their magnetic properties related to the length of the polymer. Peripentacene dimers exhibit an antiferromagnetic (S = 0) singlet ground state. They are characterized by singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (J  eff  ) of 2.5 meV, whereas trimers and longer peripentacene polymers reveal a paramagnetic nature and feature Kondo fingerprints at each terminus due to the unpaired spin.

However, conventional CL sensing usually operates in the range of 400&#8208;850 nm, which limits the high&#8208;performance of  in vivo  imaging due to the serious light scattering effect and signals attenuation in tissue. To address this challenge,  here we present a new type of  CL sensor in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II CLS) with deep penetration depth (~ 8 mm) by employing successive CL resonance energy transfer (CRET) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the activated CL substrate to two rationally designed donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor fluorophores BTD540 and BBTD700. NIR&#8208;II CLS can be selectively activated by hydrogen peroxide over other reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Moreover, NIR&#8208;II CLS is capable of detecting local inflammation in mice with 4.5&#8208;fold higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) than that under NIR&#8208;II fluorescence modality.</dc:description>

As a result, detecting and inhibiting the activities of &#946;&#8208;lactamase are of great value for the rational use of antibiotics and the treatment of infectious diseases. At present, many specific detection methods and inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;lactamase have been developed and applied in clinical practice.

      <dc:description>The stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes is one of the most representative reactions in boron chemistry. This process has been used extensively to develop powerful methods for asymmetric synthesis, with applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to natural products. Typically, 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes is driven by displacement of an  &#945;  &#8208;leaving group, oxidation of an  &#945;  &#8208;boryl radical, or electrophilic activation of an alkenyl boronate complex. The aim of this article is to summarize the recent advances in the rapidly expanding field of electrophile&#8208;induced stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of groups from boron to  sp  2  and  sp  3  carbon centers. It will be shown that three different conceptual approaches can be utilized to enable the 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes: stereospecific Zweifel&#8208;type reactions, catalytic conjunctive coupling reactions, and transition metal&#8208;free  sp  2  &#8208;  sp  3  couplings.

      <title>In Situ Dispersion of Pd on TiO2 During Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction: Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pd</title>
      <dc:description>Expanding the application scope of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to high&#8208;temperature hydrogenation requires materials that thermodynamically favor metal atom isolation over cluster formation under these conditions. Here, we show that Pd can be predominantly dispersed as isolated atoms onto TiO  2  during the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction at 400 &#176;C. Achieving atomic dispersion requires an artificial increase of the absolute TiO  2  surface area by an order of magnitude and can be accomplished by physically mixing a precatalyst (Pd/TiO  2  ) with neat TiO  2  prior to the rWGS reaction. The  in situ  dispersion of Pd was reflected through a continuous increase of rWGS activity over 92 h and supported by kinetic analysis, infrared spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The thermodynamic stability of Pd under high&#8208;temperature rWGS conditions is associated with Pd&#8208;Ti coordination (enthalpic stabilization), which seemingly manifests upon O&#8208;vacancy formation, and the artificial increase in TiO  2  surface area (entropic stabilization). In addition to this, steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis suggests an upper limit of two for the number of oxide&#8208;supported atoms required to catalyze the WGS reaction. Our approach to noble metal SACs synthesis can be generally applied and provides a platform to study the reactivity of heterolytically&#8208;activated hydrogen toward unsaturated functional groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;enantiopure trimerization of 9&#8208;Ethynylphenanthrene on a chiral

metal surface</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioselectivity in heterogeneous catalysis strongly depends on the chirality transfer between catalyst surface and all reactants, intermediates, and the product along the reaction pathway. Here we report the first enantioselective on&#8208;surface synthesis of molecular structures from an intial racemic mixture and without the need of enantiopure modifier molecules. The reaction consists of a trimerization via an unidentified bonding motif of prochiral 9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene (9&#8208;EP) upon annealing to 500 K on the chiral Pd3&#8208;terminated PdGa{111} surfaces into essentially enantiopure, homochiral 9&#8208;EP propellers. The observed behavior is in stark contrast to the reaction of 9&#8208;EP on the chiral Pd1&#8208;terminated PdGa{111} surfaces, where 9&#8208;EP monomers that are in nearly enantiopure configuration, dimerize without particular enantiomeric excess. Our findings demonstrate strong chiral recognition and a significant ensemble effect in the PdGa system, hence highlighting the huge potential of chiral intermetallic compounds for enantioselective synthesis and underlining the importance to control the catalytically active sites at the atomic level.</dc:description>

      <title>Design of optical imaging probes by screening of diverse substrate libraries directly in disease tissue extracts</title>

      <title>Understanding the interaction of polyelectrolyte architectures with proteins and biosystems</title>
      <dc:description>Polyelectrolytes such as e.g. DNA or heparin are long linear or branched macromolecules onto which charges are appended. The counterions neutralizing these charges may dissociate in water and will largely determine the interaction of such polyelectrolytes with biomolecules and in particular with proteins. Here we review studies on the interaction of proteins with polyelectrolytes and how this knowledge can be used for medical applications. Counterion release was identified as the main driving force for the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes: Patches of positive charge become multivalent counterions of the polyelectrolyte which leads to the release of counterions of the polyelectrolyte and a concomitant increase of entropy. We show this by surveying investigations done on the interaction of proteins with natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes. Special emphasis is laid on sulfated dendritic polyglycerols (dPGS). The entire overview demonstrates that we are moving on to a better understanding of charge&#8208;charge interaction in system of biological relevance.

      <dc:description>Elucidating the effects of crystallization induced blue shift emission of a newly synthesized di&#8208;boron complex (DBC) by enhanced photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in the annihilation pathway was realized for the first time. The 57 nm blue&#8208;shift and great enhancement in the crystalline lattice relative to the DBC solution were attributed to the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) and confirmed by PL imaging, x&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as DFT calculations. It was discovered that ECL at crystalline film/solution interfaces can be further enhanced by means of both coreactant route and RIR. The RIR contributions with coreactant increased ECL up to 5 times more. Very interestingly, the coreactant system was found to give off a redshifted light emission. Mechanistic studies reveal that a difference between location of the ECL in the coreactant route and that in the annihilation pathway leads to an alternative emission wavelength.</dc:description>

      <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere Nanoreactors Loaded with PdCu Nanoparticles: Void&#8208;Confinement Effects in Liquid&#8208;Phase Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoreactors with hollow structures have attracted great interest in catalysis research due to their void&#8208;confinement effects. However, the challenge in unambiguously unraveling these confinement effects is to decouple them from other factors affecting the catalytic behaviors. Here, we synthesize a pair of hollow carbon sphere (HCS) nanoreactors with pre&#8208;synthesized PdCu nanoparticles encapsulated inside of HCS (PdCu@HCS) and supported outside of HCS (PdCu/HCS), respectively, while keeping other structural features the same. Based on the two comparative nanoreactors, void&#8208;confinement effects in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation are investigated in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. It is found that hydrogenations over PdCu@HCS are shown as shape&#8208;selective catalysis, can be accelerated (accumulation of reactants), decelerated (mass transfer limitation) and even inhibited (molecular&#8208;sieving effect), respectively; conversion of the intermediate in the void space can be further promoted. Using this principle, a specific imine is selectively produced. This work provides proofs of concept for fundamental catalysis of the hollow nanoreactors.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorogenic Probe Using a Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement for Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) mediates the biology of wound healing, apoptosis, inflammation, etc. H  2  O  2&#160;  has been fluorometrically imaged with protein&#8208; or small molecule&#8208;based probes. However, only protein&#8208;based probes have afforded temporal insights within seconds. Small molecule&#8208;based electrophilic probes for H  2  O  2  &#160;require many minutes for a sufficient response in biological systems. Here, we report a fluorogenic probe that selectively undergoes a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement (seleno&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement) with H  2  O  2  , followed by an acetal hydrolysis, to produce a green fluorescent molecule in seconds. Unlike other electrophilic probes, the current probe acts as a nucleophile. The fast kinetics enabled real&#8208;time imaging of H  2  O  2  &#160;produced in endothelial cells in 8 seconds (much earlier than previously shown) and H  2  O  2  &#160;in a zebrafish wound healing model. This work may provide a platform for endogenous H  2  O  2  &#160;detection in real time with chemical probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Pt and CuOx decorated TiO2 photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to C2 hydrocarbons in a flow reactor</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) has been considered as one of the most promising and attractive catalytic technology to upgrade methane. However, C  2  products (C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  ) from conventional methane conversion have not yielded commercially due to the competition from overoxidation and carbon accumulation at high temperatures. Herein, we reported the co&#8208;deposition of Pt nanoparticles and CuO  x  clusters on TiO  2  (PC&#8208;50), and then used the photocatalyst to demonstrate the first successful case of photocatalytic OCM in a flow reactor operated at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. The optimized Cu  0.1  Pt  0.5  /PC&#8208;50 sample showed a highest yield of C  2  product of 6.8 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  , at the space velocity of 2400 h  &#8208;1  , two times higher than the sum of the activity of Pt/PC&#8208;50 (1.07 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  ) and Cu/PC&#8208;50 (1.9 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  ), and it might also be the highest among photocatalytic methane conversions reported so far under atmospheric pressure. A high selectivity of 60% to C  2  was also comparable to the benchmark work of conventional high temperature (&gt;943K) thermal catalysis. It is proposed that Pt functioned as an electron acceptor facilitating charge separation, while holes could transfer to CuO  x  avoiding deep dehydrogenation and overoxidation of C  2  products. This work provides a new revenue for photocatalytic methane upgrade.</dc:description>

      <title>Regioselective Generation of Single&#8208;Site Ir Atoms and their Evolution into Stabilized Subnanometric Ir Clusters in MWW Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>Preparation of supported metal catalysts with uniform particle size and coordination environment is a challenging and important topic in materials chemistry and catalysis. In this work, we report the regioselective generation of single&#8208;site Ir atoms and their evolution into stabilized subnanometric Ir clusters in MWW zeolite, which are located at the 10MR window connecting the two neighboring 12MR supercages. The size of the subnanometric Ir clusters can be controlled by the post&#8208;synthesis treatments and maintain below 1 nm even after being reduced at 650  o  C, which cannot be readily achieved with samples prepared by conventional impregnation methods. The high structure sensitivity, size&#8208;dependence, of catalytic performance in the alkane hydrogenolysis reaction of Ir clusters in the subnanometric regime is evidenced.</dc:description>

      <title>Water can Crosslink a Single Poly(ionic liquid) into Porous Supramolecular Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>Reversible regulation of membrane microstructures  via  non&#8208;covalent interactions is of considerable interest yet remains a challenge. Herein, we discover a general one&#8208;step approach to fabricate supramolecular porous polyelectrolyte membranes (SPPMs) from a single poly(ionic liquid) (PIL). The experimental results and theoretical simulation suggested that SPPMs were formed by a hydrogen bond&#8208;induced phase separation of a PIL between its polar and apolar domains, which were linked together by water molecules. This unique feature was capable of modulating microscopic porous architectures and thus the global mechanical property of SPPMs by a rational design of the molecular structure of PILs. Such SPPMs could switch porosity upon thermal stimuli, as exemplified by dynamically adaptive transparency to thermal fluctuation. This finding provides fascinating opportunities for creating multifunctional SPPMs.</dc:description>

The experimental results and theoretical simulation suggested that SPPMs were formed by a hydrogen bond&#8208;induced phase separation of a PIL between its polar and apolar domains, which were linked together by water molecules. This unique feature was capable of modulating microscopic porous architectures and thus the global mechanical property of SPPMs by a rational design of the molecular structure of PILs. Such SPPMs could switch porosity upon thermal stimuli, as exemplified by dynamically adaptive transparency to thermal fluctuation. This finding provides fascinating opportunities for creating multifunctional SPPMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Anchoring supramolecular polymers to human red blood cells by combining dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent chemistries</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding cell/material interactions is essential to design functional cell&#8208;responsive materials. While the scientific literature abounds with formulations of biomimetic materials, only a fraction of them focused on mechanisms of the molecular interactions between cells and material. To provide new knowledge on the strategies for materials/cell recognition and binding, benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide supramolecular copolymers bearing benzoxaborole moieties are anchored on the surface of human erythrocytes via benzoxaborole/sialic acid binding.

Exploiting this imaging method, we observe that the functional copolymers specifically interact with the cell surface.

      <title>Regenerable Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photo&#8208;enhanced Uranium Adsorption from Seawater</title>
      <dc:description>Uranium is a key resource for the development of the nuclear industry, and extracting uranium from the natural seawater is one of the most promising ways to address the shortage of uranium resources. Herein, a semiconducting covalent organic framework (named NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO) with excellent photocatalytic and photoelectric activities was synthesized. The excellent photocatalytic effect endowed NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO with a high anti&#8208;biofouling activity by generating biotoxic reactive oxygen species, and promoting photoelectrons to reduce the adsorbed U(VI) to insoluble U(IV), thereby increasing the uranium extraction capacity. Owing to the photoinduced effect, the adsorption capacity of NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO to uranium in seawater reaches 6.07 mg g &#8208;1  , which is 1.33 times of that in dark.

      <title>Hierarchical Structure of NiMo Hydrodesulfurization Catalysts Determined by Ptychographic X&#8208;ray Computed Tomography</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrodesulphurization, the removal of sulphur from crude oils, is an essential catalytic process in the petroleum industry safeguarding the production of clean hydrocarbons. Sulphur removal is critical for the functionality of downstream processes and vital to the elimination of environmental pollutants. The effectiveness of such an endeavour is among other factors determined by the structural arrangement of the heterogeneous catalyst. Namely, the accessibility of the catalytically active molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) slabs located on the surfaces of a porous alumina carrier. Here, we examined a series of pristine sulfided Mo and NiMo hydrodesulphurization catalysts of increasing metal loading prepared on commercial alumina carriers using ptychographic X&#8208;ray computed nanotomography. Structural analysis revealed a build consisting of two interwoven support matrix elements differing in nanoporosity. With increasing metal loading, approaching that of industrial catalysts, these matrix elements exhibit a progressively dissimilar MoS  2  surface coverage as well as MoS  2  cluster formation at the matrix element boundaries. This is suggestive of metal deposition limitations and/ or catalyst activation and following prohibitive of optimal catalytic utilization. These results will allow for diffusivity calculations, a better rationale of current generation catalyst performance as well as a better distribution of the active phase in next&#8208;generation hydrodesulphurization catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Porphyrin&#8208;ionic liquid coassembly polymorphism controlled by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding and controlling multicomponent coassembly is of primary importance in different fields, such as materials fabrication, pharmaceutical polymorphism and supramolecular polymerization, but these aspects have been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we discover that liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) into ion cluster&#8208;rich and ion cluster&#8208;poor liquid phases is the first step prior to coassembly nucleation based on a model system of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin and ionic liquids.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Perovskite CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Driven by Photo&#8208;Induced Alkynyl Homocoupling Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Surface&#8208;bound ligand molecules with suitable chemical and physical properties have been widely employed not only in nanocrystal synthesis where the size, morphology, phase structure, and even optoelectronic features can be defined, they have also been utilized in modulating the assembly behaviors of nanocrystals in terms of the packing modes, dimensions, as well as functionalities. Herein, we report a facile growth of 3&#8208;dimensional CsPbBr  3  perovskite supercrystals (PSCs) self&#8208;assembled from individual CsPbBr  3  perovskite quantum dot (PQD). By varying the carbon chain length of the ligand molecule, 1&#8208;alkynyl acid, different morphologies of PSCs were obtained accompanied with over 1000&#8208;fold photoluminescence improvement compared with that of PQDs. Systematic analyses have shown for the first time that under UV irradiation, CsBr, the byproduct formed during PQDs synthesis could effectively catalyze the homocoupling reaction between two alkynyl groups, which further worked as a driving force to push forward the self&#8208;assembly of PQDs. This discovery has offered a brand new and reliable strategy for growing high quality PSCs with significantly improved performance, which shall also be applicable to other nanocrystal systems aiming at unprecedented photonic, optoelectronic, and/or magnetic functionalities.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Carboxylates</title>
      <dc:description>Carboxylate esters have many desirable features as electrophiles for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling: they are easy to access, robust during multistep synthesis, and mass efficient in coupling reactions. Alkenyl carboxylates, a class of readily prepared non&#8208;aromatic electrophiles, remain difficult to functionalize via cross&#8208;coupling. We demonstrate that Pd catalysis is effective for coupling electron&#8208;deficient alkenyl carboxylates with arylboronic acids in the absence of base or oxidants. Furthermore, these reactions can proceed by two distinct mechanisms for C&#8211;O bond activation. A Pd(0)/(II) catalytic cycle is viable when using a Pd(0) precatalyst, with turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8211;O oxidative addition; however, an alternative pathway that involves alkene carbopalladation and &#946;&#8208;carboxyl elimination is proposed for Pd(II) precatalysts. This work provides a clear path toward engaging myriad oxygen&#8208;based electrophiles in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

A Pd(0)/(II) catalytic cycle is viable when using a Pd(0) precatalyst, with turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8211;O oxidative addition; however, an alternative pathway that involves alkene carbopalladation and &#946;&#8208;carboxyl elimination is proposed for Pd(II) precatalysts. This work provides a clear path toward engaging myriad oxygen&#8208;based electrophiles in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tailoring Poly(ether sulfone) Bipolar Membrane for Osmotic Energy Generator with High Power Density</title>
      <dc:description>Osmotic energy, obtained through different concentration of salt solutions, is recognized as a kind of sustainable energy source because few pollutants are discharged during electricity generation process. Lately, asymmetric aromatic compound membranes have attracted worldwide concern thanks to their low cost and high performance in osmotic energy conversion.

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part C. Toward Consilience</title>

Abstract
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and for searchers for understanding. We begin by looking at theory and simulation, surrounded as they are by and interacting with experiment, especially in Chemistry. Experimenters ask questions both conceptual and numerical, and so draw the communities together. Two case studies show what brings the theoretician authors joy in this playground, and two more detailed ones make it clear that computation/simulation is anyway deeply intertwined with theory&#8208;building in what we do, or for that matter, anywhere in the profession. From a definition of science we try to foresee how simulation and theory will interact in the AI&#8208;dominated future. We posit that Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a link to Art, and a passage to a renewed vision of the sacred in science.

      <title>Enantiodivergent cyclization by inversion of the reactivity in ambiphilic molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Inverting the reactivity of the functional groups in ambiphilic molecules provides a new synthetic strategy to carry out late&#8208;stage enantiodivergence. Both enantiomers of the final compound can be obtained from a common chiral precursor. As a proof of concept, the synthesis of substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered oxacycles is described. The key step is the cyclization of an ambiphilic linear precursor bearing a propargylic alcohol and an epoxide linked through an alkyl chain. Through a slight modification of these linear precursors and employing different reaction conditions, these functional groups can inverse their chemical reactivity, producing one enantiomer or another of the final product. This enantiodivergent cyclization involves three stereogenic centers that can undergo fully controlled retention or inversion of their configuration depending on the cyclization pathway that is activated. The cyclization provides late&#8208;stage enantiodivergence, enabling the synthesis of either enantiomers of the oxacycles from a common chiral substrate with total transfer of the enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

      <title>Designed Synthesis of a 1D Polymer in Twist&#8208;Stacked Topology via Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Arrangement of polymer&#8208;chains dictates the bulk properties of polymers and there is great interest in methodologies for aligning polymer chains in desired topologies. To synthesize a 1D polymer in a novel twist&#8208;stacked topology, we designed a peptide&#8208;monomer HC&#8801;CCH  2  &#8208;NH&#8208;Ile&#8208;Leu&#8208;N  3,  which crystallizes in P6  5  space group with its molecules H&#8208;bonded along a six&#8208;fold screw axis. These H&#8208;bonded columns pack parallelly such that molecules arrange head&#8208;to&#8208;tail forming linear non&#8208;covalent chains in planes perpendicular to the screw axis.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Arrangement of polymer&#8208;chains dictates the bulk properties of polymers and there is great interest in methodologies for aligning polymer chains in desired topologies. To synthesize a 1D polymer in a novel twist&#8208;stacked topology, we designed a peptide&#8208;monomer HC&#8801;CCH  2  &#8208;NH&#8208;Ile&#8208;Leu&#8208;N  3,  which crystallizes in P6  5  space group with its molecules H&#8208;bonded along a six&#8208;fold screw axis. These H&#8208;bonded columns pack parallelly such that molecules arrange head&#8208;to&#8208;tail forming linear non&#8208;covalent chains in planes perpendicular to the screw axis. These chains arrange parallelly to form molecular layers, which twist&#8208;stack along the screw axis. Crystals of this monomer, on heating, undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) Topochemical Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization to yield exclusively 1,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymer in a twist&#8208;stacked layered topology.

      <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Imide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an extensively studied class of porous materials, which distinguish themselves from other porous polymers in their crystallinity and high degree of modularity, enabling a wide range of applications. COFs are most commonly synthesized solvothermally, which is often a time consuming process and restricted to well soluble precursor molecules. Synthesis of polyimide&#8208;linked COFs (PI&#8208;COFs) is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the ring closing reaction under solvothermal conditions. Herein, we report the ionothermal synthesis of crystalline and porous PI&#8208;COFs in zinc chloride and eutectic salt mixtures. This synthesis does not require soluble precursors and the reaction time is significantly reduced as compared to standard solvothermal synthesis methods. In addition to applying the synthesis to previously reported imide COFs, a new perylene based COF was also synthesized, which could not be obtained by using the classical solvothermal route. In situ high temperature XRPD analysis hints to the formation of precursor&#8208;salt adducts as crystalline intermediates, which then react with each other to form the COF.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity of the Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate: Triggerable C&#8208;C Bond Formation and Rate Control in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity (MLC) had a remarkable impact on transition metal chemistry and catalysis. By use of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate, [1]  &#8208;  , which features a square&#8208;planar Al(III), we transfer this concept into the p&#8208;block and fully elucidate its mechanisms by experiment and theory. Complementary to transition metal&#8208;based MLC (aromatization upon substrate binding), substrate binding in [1]  &#8208;  occurs by dearomatization of the ligand. The aluminate trapps carbonyls by the formation of C&#8208;C and Al&#8208;O bonds, but the products maintain full reversibility and outstanding dynamic exchange rates. Remarkably, the C&#8208;C bonds can be formed or cleaved by the addition or removal of lithium cations, permitting unprecedented control over the system's constitutional state. Moreover, the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative substrate interaction allows to twist the kinetics of catalytic hydroboration reactions in a unique sense. Ultimately, this work describes the evolution of an anti&#8208;van't Hoff/Le Bel species from their being as a structural curiosity to their application as a reagent and catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Keteniminium&#8208;Driven Umpolung Difunctionalization of Ynamides</title>
      <dc:description>
Trapped: A nondirected keteniminium&#8208;driven multicomponent 1,2&#8208;umpolung difunctionalization of ynamides with aryl diazonium salts and aryl boronic acids under Pd catalysis for the synthesis of triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is showcased for the first time. This transformation proceeds by 1,3&#8208;migration of an electrophile from in situ generated keteniminium species to the electrophilic &#945;&#8208;position of the ynamide, followed by trapping of nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;vinylic metal species with a nucleophile.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of ynamides, aryl diazonium salts, and aryl boronic acids for the synthesis of novel triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is described. This transformation represents the first example of an umpolung regioselective unsymmetrical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation/aryl&#8208;olefination of ynamides. The aryl moieties of the diazonium salt (electrophile) and boronic acid (nucleophile) are explicitly incorporated in the electrophilic &#945;&#8208; and nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;position, respectively, of the ynamide, resulting in a single isomer of the N&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted olefin. The scope is broad (68 examples), showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. DFT calculations substantiate the rationale of the mechanistic cycle and the regioselectivity. The chemoselectivity and synthetic potential of the enamide products were also studied.
