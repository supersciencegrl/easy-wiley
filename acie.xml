         <title>A General Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Olefins Enabled by Voltage&#8208;Gated Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the discovery and development of a regioselective hydrotrifluoromethylation of olefins under electrochemical conditions. Guided by mechanistic studies, a voltage&#8208;gated electrolysis was designed by integrating two redox processes operating within a narrow potential window. This strategy facilitates olefin hydrotrifluoromethylation (over dibromination) that showcases broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Here we present the first successful hydrotrifluoromethylation of unactivated olefins under electrochemical conditions. Commercially available trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt (TT+&#8722;CF3BF4&#8722;, Ep/2=&#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) undergoes electrochemical reduction to generate CF3 radicals which add to olefins with exclusive chemoselectivity. The resulting carbon centered radical undergoes a second cathodic reduction, instead of a classical HAT process, to generate a carbanion that can be terminated by protonation from solvent. The use of MgBr2 (+0.20&#8197;V onset oxidation potential) plays a key role as an enabling sacrificial reductant for the reaction to operate in an undivided cell. Guided by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies, fine&#8208;tuning the solvent system, trifluoromethylating reagent's counteranion and careful selection of redox processes, this work led to the development of a voltage&#8208;gated electrosynthesis by pairing two redox processes with a narrow potential difference (&#916;E&#8776;1.00&#8197;V) allowing the reaction to proceed with two important advances: (a) high reactivity and selectivity towards hydrotrifluoromethylation over undesired dibromination, and (b) an unprecedented functional group tolerance, including aniline, phenols, unprotected alcohol, epoxide, trialkyl amine, and several redox sensitive heterocycles.

         <title>Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence from BN&#8208;Substituted Xanthene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives were prepared which exhibit oxygen&#8208;tolerant organic phosphorescence at room temperature in the solid state. These unexpected phosphors do not rely on typical strategies for organic phosphorescence, such as doping in polymer matrices, heavy atom incorporation, or the presence of known phosphorogenic functional groups.







Abstract
Emissive organic materials are predominantly fluorescent and there is significant interest in realizing and understanding examples that defy this paradigm and exhibit phosphorescence under ambient conditions. Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) offers the long&#8208;lived excited states and bathochromically&#8208;shifted emission maxima of phosphorescence without the use of potentially toxic and expensive transition metals. Most ORTP materials rely on well&#8208;studied structural motifs that include aryl carbonyls, sulfones, and heavy main group elements. We report the unexpected ORTP of a series of heavy atom&#8208;free BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives. The creation of heteroatom&#8208;rich scaffolds, combined with stabilizing C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions in the solid&#8208;state, resulted in oxygen&#8208;tolerant heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphorescence without relying on the use of cryogenic temperatures, polymer matrices, or host&#8211;guest interactions. The observation of ORTP in these simple systems sets a blueprint for the further development of heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphors.

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the programmability and rigid features of the DNA framework, the DNA triangular prisms are connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP) to achieve high affinity, signal intensity for sensitive detection of tumor cells. The DNA nanostructures can be also served as bridges between target cells and magnetic beads, resulting efficient isolation in whole blood.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt;90&#8201;%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.

         <title>Stereoregular Poly(Phenyl Glycidyl Ethers): In Situ Formation of a Polyether Stereocomplex from a Racemic Monomer Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;derived phenyl glycidyl ethers reveals the first in situ polyether stereocomplex formation without prior kinetic resolution of the enantiopure building blocks. Capitalizing on highly active bimetallic cobalt complexes, enantioselective ROP generates a single, enantiomeric polyether stereoisomer. Using isoselective ROP, a mixture of highly stereoregular, isotactic polyether chains of opposite chirality is generated. The substitution pattern of the phenyl glycidyl ethers not only has a dramatic impact on the thermal properties of these isotactic polyethers, but also controls the stereocomplexation of the resulting stereoisomer blends.







Abstract
Polymer stereocomplex formation represents a promising research area as it can improve thermal and mechanical properties of co&#8208;crystallized polymer strands of opposite chirality. Polymers that form stereocomplexes commonly feature high stereoregularity and usually require sourcing from enantiopure monomer building blocks. Herein, we report the in situ polyether stereocomplex formation from racemic epoxide monomers, i.e., substituted methyl phenyl glycidyl ethers. The bio&#8208;renewable glycidyl ethers were explored in both enantio&#8208; and isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (ROPs), resulting in isotactic poly(phenyl glycidyl ether). While the enantioselective ROP selectively resolves a single enantiomeric, isotactic polyether stereoisomer ([mm]P&#8805;78&#8201;%), the isoselective ROP leads to the concurrent formation of both isotactic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;poly(phenyl glycidyl ether) stereoisomers ([mm]P&#8805;92&#8201;%) and thus results directly in a stereoisomer blend, which forms a stereocomplex. This is one of only a few polymer stereocomplexes generated directly during polymerization from a racemic monomer mixture. Stereocomplexes of the different poly(phenyl glycidyl ether)s show an increase in melting temperature of up to 76&#8201;&#176;C, relative to the enantiopure parent polymers. The position of the methyl group at the phenyl ring determines both stereocomplex formation and the thermal properties of the resulting materials.

         <title>Transient transition from Stable to Dissipative Assemblies in Response to the Spatiotemporal Availability of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of a chemical fuel at a precise location causes a transition from thermodynamically stable to dissipative assemblies. After local depletion of fuel the system returns to the resting state. The study illustrates how a self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.







Abstract
The transition from inactive to active matter implies a transition from thermodynamically stable to energy&#8208;dissipating structures. Here, we show how the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel causes a thermodynamically stable self&#8208;assembled structure to transiently pass to an energy&#8208;dissipating state. The system relies on the local injection of a weak affinity phosphodiester substrate into an agarose hydrogel containing surfactant&#8208;based structures templated by ATP.

&lt;p&gt;Injection of a chemical fuel at a precise location causes a transition from thermodynamically stable to dissipative assemblies. After local depletion of fuel the system returns to the resting state. The study illustrates how a self-assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long-term structural stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from inactive to active matter implies a transition from thermodynamically stable to energy-dissipating structures. Here, we show how the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel causes a thermodynamically stable self-assembled structure to transiently pass to an energy-dissipating state. The system relies on the local injection of a weak affinity phosphodiester substrate into an agarose hydrogel containing surfactant-based structures templated by ATP. Injection of substrate leads to the inclusion of additional surfactant molecules in the assemblies leading to the formation of catalytic hotspots for substrate conversion. After the local disappearance of the substrate as a result of chemical conversion and diffusion the assemblies spontaneously return to the stable state, which can be reactivated upon the injection of a new batch of fuel. The study illustrates how a dissipating self-assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long-term structural stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Naphthocyclinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, the pyranonaphthoquinone dimers sharing unique dibenzobicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone skeleton, have been accomplished. The challenges are 1)&#8197;stereoselective synthesis of the bicyclic skeleton and 2)&#8197;enantio&#8208; and diasteoselective preparation of the pyranonaphthoquinone monomer. The keys in the total synthesis were 1)&#8197;the design of the common intermediate convertible to both acceptor and donor units, 2)&#8197;chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to couple the monomer units, and 3)&#8197;thiolate&#8208;meditated reductive cyclization to form the bicyclic core.







Abstract
After half a century from their isolation in 1974, we report the first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, two dimeric pyranonaphthoquinones featuring an unusual bicyclo[3.2.1]&#8208;octadienone core. The syntheses were achieved with full stereochemical control and functional group management, relying on 1)&#8197;enantioselective construction of the bicyclic core by Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition followed by thiolate&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization, and 2)&#8197;judicious design of a common chiral, non&#8208;racemic monomer unit that is capable of divergence into the donor and acceptor units, and reunion to construct the bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone core.

         <title>Electrolyte Reconfiguration by Cation/Anion Cross&#8208;coordination for Highly Reversible and Facile Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte reconfiguration strategy realizes the cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure to access highly reversible and facile sodium storage by optimizing the interfacial chemistry and de&#8208;solvation process in a broad range of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) materials are promising anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to low cost, high specific capacity and low working potential. However, the poor compatibility of the electrolyte with HC leads to low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics. Here, we propose an electrolyte reconfiguration strategy based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory by introducing methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (MTPPB). MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical &#960;&#8211;&#960; bridging of MTPP+&#8208;HC and interaction of MTPP+&#8208;PF6&#8722; contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6&#8722;, forming a low&#8208;resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+&#8208;Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6&#8201;%, desirable rate capability under 25&#8201;&#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1&#8197;C under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3&#8201;% and a 15&#8201;% increment of energy density under 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC&#8208;based SIBs with high energy/power density and long&#8208;life span in the extended operating&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>The Electron&#8208;Density Distribution of UCl4 and Its Topology from X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the unprecedented sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to 5&#8201;f electrons in actinide materials. This was made possible by recent advances in the experimental setup as well as data reduction strategy, and, crucially, by comparison with accurate quantum&#8208;mechanical simulations. The electron density of UCl4 crystals has been analysed. Several indicators have been discussed that reveal the participation of 5&#8201;f electrons to chemical bonds.







Abstract
The chemistry of

 electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X&#8208;ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered &#8220;almost impossible&#8221; on heavy&#8208;atom systems, until very recently. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron density distribution in UCL4 crystals and comparison with the previously reported spin density distribution from polarized neutron diffraction. All approaches provide a consistent picture in terms of electron and spin density distribution, and chemical bond characterization. More importantly, the synergy between experiments and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations allows to highlight the remarkable sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to

         <title>Adsorbate Resonance Induces Water&#8208;Metal Bonds in Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water in electrochemical environments forms hydrogen bonds with surface adsorbed intermediates, stabilizing them. However, the stabilization is not explained solely by hydrogen bonding, indicating additional effects. Using density functional theory (DFT) on coadsorbed OH and water on complex solid solutions (CSSs), we link the residual stabilization to resonance between near&#8208;surface water and *OH, which induces covalency for water to the surface.







Abstract
This study delves into the intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and H2O, on electrodes in electrochemical interfaces. These species are an inevitable part of many electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction. In our modeling, we utilize high statistics on a dataset of complex solid solutions with high atomic variability to show the emergence of H2O&#8208;metal covalent bonds under specific conditions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorption energies on many thousands of different surface compositions, we provide a quantifiable physical understanding of this induced water covalency, which is rooted in simple quantum mechanics. Directional hydrogen bonding between surface&#8208;near H2O and OH, enables surface bonding electrons to delocalize, mediated&#160;by near&#8208;symmetrical adsorbate resonance structures. The different adsorbate resonance structures differ by surface coordination explaining the induced H2O&#8208;metal bonding.

Two isomorphic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, were synthesized by grafting strategy. Among them, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 has suitable channels and can effectively separate C2H2/CO2, achieving an Ideal Adsorbent Solution Theory (IAST) selectivity of 201, thus establishing a new benchmark.







Abstract
Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.

         <title>Electrochemically Gated Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry in Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical control of frustrated Lewis pair chemistry of single boron cluster junctions is observed in electric double layer at a single&#8208;molecule level by using in situ STM break junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
The recent discovery of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) during the activation of small molecules has inspired extensive research across the full span of chemical science. Owing to the nature of weak interactions, it is experimentally challenging to directly observe and modulate FLP at the molecular scale. Here we design a boron cluster anion building block (B10H82&#8722;) and organic amine cations ([NR4]+, R=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;C2H5) as the FLP to prove the feasibility of controlling their interaction in the electric double layer (EDL) via an electrochemical strategy. In situ single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements and Raman monitoring of B10H82&#8722;&#8722;[NR4]+ FLP formed at the positively charged Au(111) electrode surface, in contrast to the free&#8208;standing B10H82&#8722; near or below the potential of zero charge (PZC). Furthermore, this FLP chemistry leads to a shift in the local density of states of boron clusters towards the EF for enhancing electron transport, providing a new prototype of a reversible single&#8208;cluster switch that digitally switches upon controlling FLP chemistry in the electric double layer.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiRu hybrid electrocatalyst with enhanced phenol adsorption, increased para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution capabilities, simultaneously achieves excellent phenol abatement and valuable p&#8208;BQ production at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5&#8201;% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.

         <title>A Novel Anion Receptor Additive for &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C Sodium Metal Batteries by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium metal batteries have garnered significant attention. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester, is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations. The additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, forming a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries, known for their high theoretical specific capacity, abundant reserves, and promising low&#8208;temperature performance, have garnered significant attention. However, the large ionic radius of Na+ and sluggish transport kinetics across the interfacial structure hinder their practical application. Previous reviews have rarely regulated electrolyte performance from the perspective of anions, as important components of the electrolyte, the regulation mechanism is not well understood. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester (ABAPE), is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations and accelerate Na+ transport kinetics. The results of theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with deep Ar&#8208;ion etching demonstrate that the introduction of this additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, reduces the desolvation barrier and forms a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF, effectively preventing the hydrolysis of NaPF6 and stabilizing acidic species. Consequently, the Na||Na symmetric cell exhibits excellent long&#8208;cycle performance of 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cell with the addition of ABAPE maintains a capacity retention of 84.29&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C after 1200&#8197;cycles and presents no capacity decay over 150&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realized the first radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins via stepwise radical process, which is different from previous examples of acyl radicals to olefins. Electrophilic activation with Tf2O was employed to overcome the challenge of excessively low reduction peak potential of amides and therefore the unprecedented iminium radicals were readily generated under our photoredox reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines.

     alt="Photoredox-Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We realized the first radical-type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins via stepwise radical process, which is different from previous examples of acyl radicals to olefins. Electrophilic activation with Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was employed to overcome the challenge of excessively low reduction peak potential of amides and therefore the unprecedented iminium radicals were readily generated under our photoredox reaction conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the preliminary success of transition metal-catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical-type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox-catalyzed radical-type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1-indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited-state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation with Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct anodic oxidative coupling process for &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation using ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis has been developed, enabling the synthesis of a diverse range of chiral heteroaromatic carbonyl compounds with high enantioselectivity and functional group tolerance, which can be applied to the synthesis of valuable frameworks like (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.







Abstract
Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.

         <title>Ni(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement of Vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) to Synthesize Six&#8208;Membered Non&#8208;Conjugated Enones</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones via vinyl&#8208;group assisted C&#8722;C cleavage enables the synthesis of non&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered enones, which are important and difficult to be accessed through other methods.







Abstract
We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) under mild conditions to synthesize non&#8208;conjugated cyclohexenone derivatives, which so far do not have many ways to be accessed. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope with reaction yields up to 98&#8201;%. This VCBO rearrangement can also be used to access various n/6 (n=5&#8211;8) bicyclic products efficiently. Furthermore, mechanism of this rearrangement has been investigated using DFT calculations, showing that vinyl group&#8208;assisted cyclobutanone C&#8722;C cleavage is easy with a computed activation free energy of 18.1&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Dynamically Confined Active Silver Nanoclusters with Ultrawide Operating Temperature Window in CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO oxidation reaction environment including O2 and H2O can afford dynamic adsorbates on metal surface and OH sites at metal/support interface to stabilize Ag nanoclusters. Dynamic confinement enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit high activity over a wide temperature window of 25&#8208;500&#8201;&#176;C under dry condition and 200&#8208;800&#8201;&#176;C under wet condition for CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Supported metal nanoclusters are often highly active in many catalytic reactions but less stable particularly under harsh reaction conditions. Here, we demonstrate that this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off can be efficiently broken through rational design of surrounding microenvironment of the supported nanocatalyst including gas adsorbate overlayer and underneath support surface chemistry. Our studies reveal that chemisorbed oxygen species on Ag surface and surface hydroxyl groups on oxide support, which are dynamically consumed during reaction but sustained by reaction environment (O2 and H2O vapor), drive spontaneous redispersion of Ag particles and stabilization of highly active Ag nanoclusters. Such a dynamic confinement effect from gas&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support interaction enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit complete catalytic oxidation of CO over a wide temperature window of 25&#8208;500&#8201;&#176;C under dry conditions and 200&#8208;800&#8201;&#176;C under wet conditions as well as remarkable stability at 300&#8201;&#176;C over 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer between the water and polydopamine interfaces under ultrasonic stimulation effectively enables the activation of oxygen under mild conditions, leading to the oxidation of methane by derived reactive oxygen species, a process that can be intensified if the catalyst suspension is pre&#8208;illuminated for a period in an oxygenated atmosphere.







Abstract
The direct conversion and efficient utilization of methane pose a critical scientific challenge. Indirect activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers a high probability of contact with methane and conversion efficiency under mild conditions. However, reported product yields are suboptimal due to challenges in activating oxygen and facilitating mass transfer in suspension systems. We propose the use of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), employing polydopamine (PDA) as a catalyst that undergoes electron transfer with oxygen under ultrasound, generating ROS that drives the partial oxidation of methane (POM). Corresponding experimental results indicate that CH3OH and most HCHO are produced directly from CH4. Furthermore, through in situ characterizations, we have shown that light pretreatment of the catalysts in an oxygenated atmosphere facilitates the forming of more C=O functional groups with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, thereby significantly enhancing overall product yields, particularly for CH3OH. Within two hours, product yields reach 1.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for HCHO and 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for CH3OH. This work introduces a novel approach for efficient POM, while highlighting the distinctive catalytic properties of PDA.

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based biomarker discovery holds immense promise. We have identified an exciting new path forward by incorporating stringent validation criteria into the analysis of high&#8208;quality MS&#8208;based discovery data. This approach facilitates a more straightforward and robust selection of peptide analytes suitable for translation into biomarkers. We applied our methods to plasma samples obtained from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort (n=492).







Abstract
Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.

We have identified an exciting new path forward by incorporating stringent validation criteria into the analysis of high-quality MS-based discovery data. This approach facilitates a more straightforward and robust selection of peptide analytes suitable for translation into biomarkers. We applied our methods to plasma samples obtained from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=492).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data-independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA-MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra-protein correlation based on 8- or 11-point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HxWO3 as a reversible hydrogen acceptor&#8208;donor is partnered with Cu to enable a relay mechanism for NITRR operated at E &gt;0 vs. RHE, which contains rapid H intercalation into HxWO3, prompt H de&#8208;intercalation from HxWO3 and transfer onto Cu and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. As a result, a high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production without competitive hydrogen evolution was achieved at record&#8208;low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution. To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at 0.10&#8197;V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Surface Matrix&#8208;Mediated Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is demonstrated to regulate the composition and surface matrix of PQDs. After cation exchange, the light absorption spectra of PQDs are broadened and the surface matrix integrity of PQDs is improved, substantially eliminating the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination and improving the phase stability for high&#8208;performance solar cells.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dot (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD) is very promising for photovoltaic applications due to its good phase stability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving the CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs with tunable compositions and robust surface matrix remains a challenge. Here, the surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange of PQDs is proposed, in which a bi&#8208;functional molecule, tetrafluoroborate methylammonium (FABF4), is applied for the cation exchange and stabilizing surface matrix of PQDs. The results reveal that the FA+ of FABF4 molecules could exchange the Cs+ of CsPbI3 PQDs forming alloy CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, allowing to tune the spectroscopies of PQDs. Meanwhile, the BF4&#8722; of FABF4 molecules can effectively stabilize the surface lattice and substantially diminish the surface vacancies of PQDs, improving the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. Consequently, CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells deliver an efficiency of up to 17.49&#8201;%, which is the highest value of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. This work provided important design principles for the composition and surface matrix regulation of PQDs for high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Precise Regulation of the Reverse Intersystem Crossing Pathway by Hybridized Long&#8208;Short Axis Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By hybridized long&#8208;short axis strategy, TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a rapid RISC rate of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, narrow FWHM of 23&#8197;nm, and small &#916;EST of 0.06&#8197;eV. The OLED without sensitizer exhibits a narrowband green emission with the FWHM of 31&#8197;nm, EQEmax of 37.9&#8201;%, and low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain a high level of 34.8&#8201;% and 21.8&#8201;% at 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules have experienced great success in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their outstanding quantum efficiencies and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs). However, the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, which will lead to relatively long triplet exciton lifetime and severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, we report an effective molecular design strategy to introduce multichannel RISC pathways and thus increase RISC rates without compromising the color fidelity and emission efficiency by the &#8220;hybridized long&#8208;short axis (HLSA)&#8221; strategy. The TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, rapid RISC rate of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, narrow FWHM of 23&#8197;nm, and small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.06&#8197;eV in solution. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED based on TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN exhibits a narrowband emission with the FWHM of 31&#8197;nm, in company with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.9&#8201;%. Notably, the device exhibits the low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain 34.8&#8201;% and 21.8&#8201;% at 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best performance for single&#8208;host OLEDs based on the BCzBN skeleton. This study provides a fresh and promising approach to realize high&#8208;performance OLEDs with high color purity and remarkable device efficiency.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linking of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to &#960;&#8208;Extended Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst for H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity were constructed using dimethyldiazapyrene as a newly developed monomer upon Knoevenagel condensation. Their &#960;&#8208;extended structures from vinylene linking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons building blocks, rendered them with promising semiconducting properties, allowing for conducting exceptional visible&#8208;light photocatalytic generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp2&#8208;carbon bridges to form high&#8208;crystalline &#960;&#8208;extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two&#8208;dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,9&#8208;diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene&#8208;linked PAH&#8208;cored COFs, which show high&#8208;crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as&#8208;prepared COFs possess spatially extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible&#8208;light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H2O2 up to 3820&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water, and even 17080&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity were constructed using dimethyldiazapyrene as a newly developed monomer upon Knoevenagel condensation. Their &#960;-extended structures from vinylene linking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons building blocks, rendered them with promising semiconducting properties, allowing for conducting exceptional visible-light photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon bridges to form high-crystalline &#960;-extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two-dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10-dimethyl-4,9-diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene-linked PAH-cored COFs, which show high-crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as-prepared COFs possess spatially extended &#960;-conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible-light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 3820&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water, and even 17080&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable, High&#8208;Yield Monolayer MXene Preparation from Multilayer MXene for Many Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature ultrasonic exfoliation can effectively weaken the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules, significantly increasing the yield of monolayer MXene and challenging traditional methods of its preparation. This method achieves a high&#8208;quality monolayer MXene yield of up to 95&#8201;%, effectively overcoming key scientific and technical bottlenecks in transitioning MXene from laboratory research to industrial applications.







Abstract
MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is renowned for its exceptional conductivity and hydrophilicity; however, the low yield of monolayers hinders its industrial scalability. Herein, we present a strategy to substantially enhance the monolayer yield by disrupting the hydrogen&#8208;bonding cage confinement of multilayer MXene using high&#8208;temperature ultrasound, challenging the conventional belief that monolayer MXene can only be prepared at lower temperatures. At approximately 70&#8201;&#176;C, the weakened hydrogen bonding between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules weakens the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement. This enables ultrasonic cavitation to generate more microbubbles that penetrate the interlayers of multilayer MXene, resulting in gentle and thorough delamination into larger monolayer nanosheets. Achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield in just tens of minutes, these nanosheets exhibit properties comparable to those produced by traditional ice&#8208;bath methods. Furthermore, the high&#8208;concentration MXene ink produced on a large scale using this high&#8208;yield approach exhibits excellent printing and processing capabilities, and the corresponding products showcase superior infrared stealth and Joule heating characteristics. This work addresses a key technical bottleneck in MXene production, paving the way for its extensive technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Electron Transport Layer with Internal Encapsulation Capability for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linkable fullerene (BCM) is synthesized and used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). BCM can in situ form a compact cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film that not only effectively transports electrons but also acts as an internal encapsulation layer to suppress the diffusion of perovskite components, thereby achieving high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in PSCs.







Abstract
A stable and compact fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) is crucial for high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, traditional fullerene&#8208;based ETLs like C60 and PCBM are prone to aggregate under operational conditions, a challenge recently recognized by academic and industrial researchers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel cross&#8208;linkable fullerene molecule, bis((3&#8208;methyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl) malonate&#8208;C60 monoadduct (BCM), for use as an ETL in PSCs. Upon a low&#8208;temperature annealing at 100&#8201;&#176;C, BCM undergoes in situ cross&#8208;linking to form a robust cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film, which demonstrates excellent electron mobility and a suitable band structure for efficient PSCs. Our results show that PSCs incorporating CBCM&#8208;based ETL achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.89&#8201;% (certified: 25.36&#8201;%), significantly surpassing the 23.25&#8201;% efficiency of PCBM&#8208;based devices. The intramolecular covalent interactions within CBCM films effectively prevent aggregation and enhance film compactness, creating an internal encapsulation layer that mitigates the decomposition and ion migration of perovskite components. Consequently, CBCM&#8208;based PSCs show exceptional stability, maintaining 97.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking, compared to only 78.6&#8201;% retention in PCBM&#8208;based devices after less than 820&#8197;hours.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Molecule Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy through Bond&#8208;Selective Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The measurement of bond&#8208;selective fluorescence facilitates mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) spectral imaging of single dye molecules under ambient conditions. This technique allows researchers to distinguish between different molecular states (e.g., monomer or dimer) based on in situ monitoring of changes in vibrational properties.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy stands as a workhorse for exploring bond vibrations, offering a wealth of chemical insights across diverse frontiers. With increasing focus on the regime of single molecules, obtaining IR&#8208;sensitive information from individual molecules at room temperature would provide essential information about unknown molecular properties. Here, we leverage bond&#8208;selective fluorescence microscopy, facilitated by narrowband picosecond mid&#8208;IR and near&#8208;IR double&#8208;resonance excitation, for high&#8208;throughput mid&#8208;IR structural probing of single molecules. We robustly capture single&#8208;molecule images and analyze the combined polarization dependence, vibrational peaks, linewidths, and lifetimes of probe molecules with representative scaffolds. From bulk to single molecules, we find that vibrational lifetimes remain consistent, while linewidths are narrowed by approximately twofold and anisotropy becomes more pronounced. Additionally, unexpected peak shifts from single molecules were observed, attributed to the generation of new modes due to previously unexplored dimerization, supported by quantum chemistry calculations. These findings underscore the importance of infrared analysis on individual single molecules in ambient environments, offering molecular information crucial for functional imaging and the investigation of the fundamental properties and utilities of luminescent molecules.

         <title>Dendritic Molecular Baskets for Selective Binding of Toxic Methotrexate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and bioactivity of dendritic basket 612&#8208;. This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (S)&#8208;glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self&#8208;association. 1H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between 612&#8208; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX2&#8208;) in water (Kd = 9.2 &#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX2&#8208; folds inside 612&#8208; (&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N&#8208;methyl group. In consequence, 612&#8208; selectively binds MTX2&#8208; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC50 &gt; 150 &#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;6]14&#8208; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX2&#8208; as dihydrofolate reductase&#8217;s affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of 612&#8208;. Nonetheless, considering the basket&#8217;s biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfurized Composite Interphase Enables a Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability and reversibility of Zn anode can be greatly improved by in&#8208;situ construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface via a low&#8208;cost design strategy of ZnSO4 electrolyte. However, the role of hydrogen bond acceptor &#8208;SO3 accompanying ZnS formation during SEI reconstruction is overlooked. In this work, we have explored and revealed the new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in&#8208;situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) on Zn anode electrochemistry in ZnSO4 aqueous electrolytes. Structure characterization and DFT demonstrate that the introduction of &#8208;SO3 can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Owing to the synergistic effect of ZnS and &#8208;SO3, a high cycling stability of 1500 h with a cumulative&#8208;plated capacity of 7.5 Ah cm&#8208;2 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 has been achieved within the symmetrical cell. Furthermore, the full cell with NH4V4O10 cathode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1 and maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. These new insights into anionic synergistic strategy could significantly enhance the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Sequence&#8208;Controlled Copolymerization of Lactones: Tailoring Material Properties from Robust Plastics to Tough Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymerization stands as a versatile and potent method for tailoring polymer properties by adjusting structural unit composition and sequence distribution. However, achieving sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization in a one&#8208;step and one&#8208;pot process remains challenging. This study introduces a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy to produce block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL). The distinct kinetics of the two monomers enable the facile synthesis of diblock and triblock copolyesters, PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Ph&#8208;BL)&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL), in non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene. Conversely, coordinating solvents like tetrahydrofuran, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4&#8208;dioxane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane facilitate frequent transesterifications, yielding statistical copolyesters P[CL&#8208;stat&#8208;(4Ph&#8208;BL)] with varying ratios of heterosequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that coordinating solvents stabilize the transition state for transesterification, thereby validating their role in triggering this process. By varying the microstructures and compositions, the resultant copolyesters display tunable thermal and mechanical properties, evolving from robust plastics with an ultimate tensile strength of up to 46.3 &#177; 3.1 MPa to tough elastomers with &gt;99.3% elastic recovery. All the copolyesters exhibit remarkable thermal stability (Td,5% = 376 &#176;C) and maintain desirable chemical circularity (&gt;92%), supporting a closed&#8208;loop life cycle for sustainable material economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Replaces Weak: &#8203;Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Anchored Electrolyte Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4 V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8208;20 ~ 60 &#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) &#160;demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations&#160; confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 2.28 times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24 times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling&#160; S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8208;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under Coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85 &#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000 h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55% than the control devices (23.03%).</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling iron oxide scale slag into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable ozone catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70% Fe2O3 and 40.30% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#183;O2&#8315;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59 &#956;g&#183;L&#8208;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Tunable Ring Expansion Enabled By A Single&#8208;Component Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable installation of a single nitrogen atom is central to many major goals in skeletal editing, with progress often gated by the availability of an appropriate N&#8208;atom source. Here we introduce a novel reagent, termed DNIBX, based on dibenzoazabicycloheptadiene (dbabh), which allows the electrophilic installation of dbabh to organic substrates. When indanone &#946;&#8208;ketoesters are aminated by DNIBX, the resulting products undergo divergent ring expansions depending on the mode of activation, producing heterocycles in differing oxidation states under thermal and photochemical conditions. The mechanism of each transformation is discussed, and the different reactivity modes of the indanone&#8208;dbabh adducts are compared to other nitrogenous precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroarene for Efficient Photothermal Conversion via Boosting Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel ladder&#8208;type conjugated molecules is crucial for advancing supramolecular chemistry and material science. In this study, we report a straightforward synthesis of new alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, and demonstrate its application as photothermal agent for imaging and cancer therapy. FCDTDPP is constructed by vinylene bridge between cyclopentadithiophene (D) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (A) through intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type reaction. FCDTDPP exhibits unique combination of good molecular planarity, efficient intra/inter&#8208;molecular mixed D&#8208;A interactions, and local aromaticity. These features collectively contribute to its broad and intense absorptions with narrow bandgap in red band of the spectra, coupled with multiple vibrational absorption feature, thereby enhancing non&#8208;radiative decay process and resulting in efficient photothermal conversion property. FCDTDPP and its nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit superior photothermal conversion performance and stability under 660 nm laser irradiation. Moreover, in vitro studies reveal that FCDTDPP NPs possess excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and robust photothermal therapeutic efficacy, a finding further corroborated by preliminary in vivo experiments in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work charts a novel course for the molecular engineering of organic photothermal conversion systems, propelling relevant research forward.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>J&#8208;aggregates show great promise in phototherapy, but are limited to specific molecular skeletons and poor molecular self&#8208;assembly controllability. Herein, we report a twisted&#8208;planar molecular strategy with sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation to develop donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type J&#8208;aggregates for phototherapy. With propeller aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) moieties as the twisted subunits and thiophene as the planar &#960;&#8208;bridge, the optimal twisted&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;interaction in MTSIC induces appropriate slip angle and J&#8208;aggregates formation, red&#8208;shifting the absorption from 624 to 790 nm. In contrast, shorter &#960;&#8208;planarity results in amorphous aggregates, and elongation promotes charge transfer (CT) coupled J&#8208;aggregates. Sonication was demonstrated to be effective in controlling self&#8208;assembly behaviors of MTSIC, which enables the transformation from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and finally to stable J&#8208;aggregates. After encapsulation with lipid&#8208;PEG, the resultant J&#8208;dots show enhanced phototherapeutic effects over amorphous dots, including brightness, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and photothermal conversion, delivering superior cancer phototherapy performance. This work not only advances D&#8208;A type J&#8208;aggregates design but also provides a promising strategy for supramolecular assembly development.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling Polyethylene to High&#8208;Purity Hydrogen under Ambient Conditions via Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most abundant plastic waste, and its conversion to hydrogen (H2) offers a promising route for clean energy generation. However, PE decomposition typically requires high temperatures due to its strong chemical bonds, leading to significant carbon emissions and low H2 selectivity (theoretically less than 75 vol% after accounting for further steam&#8208;reforming reactions). Here, we report a mechanocatalytic strategy that upcycles PE into high&#8208;purity H2 (99.4 vol%) with an exceptional H2 recovery ratio of 98.5% (versus 15.7% via thermocatalysis), using manganese as a catalyst at a low temperature of 45 &#176;C. This method achieves a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The marked improvement in H2 recovery ratio is mainly due to metal carbides formation induced by the mechanocatalytic process, which does not catalyze hydrocarbons formation. This work is expected to advance studies of the conversion of polyolefins to high&#8208;purity H2 with net&#8208;zero carbon emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Kinetics of Carbon&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Bond Formation in Metazoan Fatty Acid Synthase and its Impact on Product Fidelity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatty acid synthase (FAS) multienzymes are responsible for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and crucial in primary metabolism. Despite extensive research, the molecular details of the FAS catalytic mechanisms are still poorly understood. For example, the b&#8208;ketoacyl synthase (KS) catalyzes the fatty acid elongating carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;bond formation, which is the key catalytic step in biosynthesis, but factors that determine the speed and accuracy of his reaction are still unclear. Here, we report enzyme kinetics of the KS&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, enabled by a continuous fluorometric activity assay. We observe that the KS is likely rate&#8208;limiting to the fatty acid biosynthesis, its kinetics are adapted to the length of the bound fatty acyl chain, and that the KS is also responsible for the fidelity of biosynthesis by preventing intermediates from undergoing KS&#8208;mediated elongation. To provide mechanistic insight into KS selectivity, we performed computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identify positive cooperativity of the KS dimer, which we suggest to affect the conformational variability of the multienzyme. Advancing our knowledge about the KS molecular mechanism will pave the ground for engineering FAS for biotechnology applications and the design of new therapeutics targeting the fatty acid metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally&#8208;Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)&#8208;connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self&#8208;assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self&#8208;assembly of DNA motif into long double&#8208;stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1&#8208;regulated DNA assembly allows for cell&#8208;selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re&#8208;engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched "ON''), whereas light&#8208;mediated fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched "OFF"), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report&#160;co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97%, generating &gt;85% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3% to 8.6%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Switchable Global Chirality&#160;in Racemic Polymer Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Any polymers composed of racemic segments are obviously optically inactive and lack any chiroptical applications. Here, we present an intriguing method for precisely generating global chirality in racemic copolymer assemblies without any external asymmetrical intervention via step&#8208;wise polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). Global supramolecular chirality of the nanoaggregates could be dynamically switched by the two diametrically opposed chiral conflict effects: &#8220;first come, first serve&#8221; effect and &#8220;late&#8208;comer lives above&#8221; effect, which can be controlled by the precisely specified the number and sequence of enantiomeric segments. Significantly, the supramolecular stacking manners of the racemic mesogenic building units as well as the liquid crystallinity of the solvophobic core play a crucial role for the chiral communication pathway of enantiomeric mesogens. Furthermore, such switchable global chirality in racemic polymers is broadly applicable and well regulable. We propose that this research may challenge the notion that racemic systems lack optical activity while highlighting their potential applications in functional racemic polymer materials and providing insights into the evolution of racemates towards homochirality on early Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Transportation Across Liquid Membranes Mediated by Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Solvating Electrolytes with Core&#8208;Shell Solvation Structure for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical energy density of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is limited by the low sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte conditions. The highly solvating electrolytes (HSEs) promise to address the issue at harsh conditions, but the conflicting challenges of long&#8208;term stability of radical&#8208;mediated sulfur redox reactions (SRR) and the poor stability with lithium metal anode (LMA) have dimmed the efforts. We now present a unique core&#8208;shell solvation structured HSE formulated with classical ether&#8208;based solvents and phosphoramide co&#8208;solvent. The unique core&#8208;shell solvation structure features confinement of the phosphoramide in the first solvation shell, which prohibits severe contact reactions with LMA and endows prolonged stability for [S3]&#8226;&#8211; radical, favoring a rapid radical&#8208;mediated solution&#8208;based SRR. The cell with the proposed electrolyte showing a high capacity of 864 mA h gsulfur&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading of 5.5 mgsulfur cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 4 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1. The strategy further enables steady cycling of a 2.71&#8208;A h pouch cell with a high specific energy of 307 W h kg&#8722;1. Our work highlights the fundamental chemical concept of tuning the solvation structure to simultaneously tame the SRR and LMA stability for metal&#8208;sulfur batteries wherein the electrode reactions are heavily coupled with electrolyte chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs) have been developed by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. These chimeras enable targeted membrane protein degradation and drug delivery for cancer combination immunotherapy through multireceptor&#8208;mediated recognition and endocytosis, providing a versatile tool for personalized disease treatment.







Abstract
Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8722;L1 and HER2 targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.

         <title>A New Class of Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx for Solid&#8208;state Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries are gaining traction due to the high abundance and lower cost compared to lithium, along with the safety advantages of solid&#8208;state batteries. A new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx, synthesized with both Nb2O5 and NbCl3O via a simple mechanochemical reaction is presented. NaNbCl4O exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries are gaining momentum due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium compared to lithium. Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries can also provide further safety advantages. However, sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) that meet all the rigorous requirements, such as high ionic conductivity, oxidative stability with the cathode, and ease of processability, are lacking. We present here a new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx with a facile mechanochemical synthesis. The oxyhalide NaNbCl4O exhibits close to two orders of magnitude higher ambient&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to the halide counterpart NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Structural motifs unique to the oxygen content in NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx are identified with 23Na and 93Nb magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries assembled with NaNbCl4O electrolyte and the cobalt&#8208; and nickel&#8208;free layered Na0.70Fe0.3Mn0.65Al0.05O2 cathode exhibit a maximum discharge capacity of 155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with good cycle life at ambient temperature.

         <title>Computational Stabilization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme Enables Efficient Evolution of New Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non&#8208;native functions. A stabilized redesigned enzyme can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation reaction.







Abstract
Deep learning tools for enzyme design are rapidly emerging, and there is a critical need to evaluate their effectiveness in engineering workflows. Here we show that the deep learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non&#8208;native functions. This superfamily has diverse catalytic functions and could provide a rich new source of biocatalysts for synthesis and industrial processes. Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme. After three rounds of directed evolution, we obtained a 6&#8208;fold activity increase from the wild&#8208;type parent and an 80&#8208;fold increase from the stabilized variant. To generate the initial stabilized variant, we identified multiple structural and sequence constraints to preserve catalytic function. We applied these criteria to produce stabilized, catalytically active variants of a second Fe(II)/&#945;KG enzyme, suggesting that the approach is generalizable to additional members of the Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily. ProteinMPNN is user&#8208;friendly and widely accessible, and our results provide a framework for the routine implementation of deep learning&#8208;based protein stabilization tools in directed evolution workflows for novel biocatalysts.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence Nanocrystals with 1710&#8197;nm Excitation for in vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the anti&#8208;Stokes shift luminescence nanocrystals LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Tm@LiErF4@LiYF4, featuring both excitation (1710&#8197;nm) and emission (1532&#8197;nm) wavelengths within the NIR&#8208;II&#8722;L (1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window. The proposed nanocrystals had the potential for in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging, which could be applied for revealing varying metabolic rates of mouse liver and intestines under different physiological conditions.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;Stokes luminescence (ASL) based on lanthanide nanocrystals holds immense promise for in vivo optical imaging and bio&#8208;detection, which benefits from filtered autofluorescence. However, the current longest emission and excitation wavelengths of lanthanide ASL system were shorter than 1200&#8197;nm and 1532&#8197;nm, respectively, which limited tissue penetration depth and caused low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of in vivo imaging due to tissue scattering and water absorption. In this work, we extended the excitation wavelength to 1710&#8197;nm with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) emission up to 1650&#8197;nm through a novel ASL nanocrystal LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%Tm@LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;70&#8201;%Er@LiYF4. Compared with 1532&#8197;nm excited ASL nanoprobes, the 1710&#8197;nm excited nanocrystals could improve in vivo imaging SNR by 12.72&#8197;folds. Based on this excellent imaging performance of the proposed ASL nanoprobes, three&#8208;channel in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging was achieved, which quantitatively revealed metabolic rates of intestinal dynamics and liver enrichment under anesthetized and awake states. This innovative ASL nanoprobes and dynamic multiplexed imaging technology would be conducive to optimizing dosing regimen and treatment plans across various physiological conditions.

         <title>Determining the Absolute Configuration of Small Molecules by Diffusion NMR Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determining the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a fundamental analytical challenge, particularly in NMR spectroscopy, where enantiomer signals are overlapped. A convenient new approach is proposed, CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent (CHIMERA), which combines chiral micelles and resolving chemical shift agents to provide a rapid solution for resolving enantiomers and determining the absolute configuration via diffusion NMR.







Abstract
Enantiomers are ubiquitous in many areas of science, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) alone is not able to differentiate enantiomers as their spectra are identical. However, these can be distinguished using chiral auxiliaries (such as chiral complexing agents) that form diastereomeric complexes, but absolute identification is still troublesome, usually requiring a chemical reaction with a chiral derivatizing agent. Here, we propose a new method that uses a hybrid mixture of solvating agents in a simple comparison of diffusion NMR experiments, which can discriminate enantiomers in both frequency and diffusion domains, dubbed CHIMERA (CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent). The new method was assessed for twenty&#8208;three small chiral molecules using a combination of BINOL and (&#8722;)&#8208;DMEB, a chiral surfactant, and initial results indicate that absolute configuration can be obtained from a simple experiment.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Diborylation and Silaboration of Azoarenes: A Simple Photoinduced Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have shown that, in the absence of a catalyst or a base, azoarenes&#8242; photoswitchability can be exploited to aid in their diborylation into 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)hydrazines. The transformation is achieved using commercially available diboron reagent, bis(catecholato)diboron and extremely mild conditions are used in the devised approach. Moreover, silaboranes were also activated using this process to yield 1&#8208;silyl&#8208;2&#8208;borylhydrazines.







Abstract
The diborylation of the N=N double bond of azoarenes has been achieved using a commercially available diboron reagent, B2cat2 [bis(catecholato)diboron]. By utilizing the photo&#8208;switchable nature of azoarenes under blue&#8208;LED light irradiation, an uncatalyzed diborylation and silaboration yielded a broad range of functionalized hydrazine derivatives. The mechanistic origin validates the importance of cis configuration, which is corroborated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Structurally Compact Penta(N,N&#8208;diphenylamino)corannulene as Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a downsizing strategy by combining a dynamic bowl&#8208;shaped core with smaller DPA groups to fabricate structurally compact HTMs. The unique structure of the HTMs facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, efficient film formation, and charge transport, resulting in enhanced charge mobility and glass transition temperature. Consequently, the PSC employing the dopant&#8208;free HTM exhibits an impressive PCE of 24.01&#8201;% along with exceptional operational stability, retaining 96&#8201;% of its initial performance after 800&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are essential for improving the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we have designed and synthesized a novel organic small molecule HTM, cor&#8208;(DPA)5, characterized by a bowl&#8208;shaped core with symmetric five diphenylamine groups. Compared to already&#8208;known HTMs, the bowl&#8208;shaped and relatively compact structure of cor&#8208;(DPA)5 facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, promotes film formations, and enhances charge transport. Consequently, the cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5 HTM exhibits high charge mobility, exceptional hydrophobicity, and a significantly elevated glass transition temperature. Superior to previously reported HTMs such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and cor&#8208;OMePTPA, our newly synthesized cor&#8208;(DPA)5 HTM is free from any ionic dopants. As a result, the dopant&#8208;free cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5&#8208;based PSC demonstrates an impressive efficiency of 24.01&#8201;%, and exhibits outstanding operational stability. It retains 96&#8201;% after continuous exposure to 1 sun irradiation for 800&#8197;hours under MPP (maximum power point) tracking in ambient air. These findings present a structurally compact novel HTM and exemplify a new approach to the molecular design of HTM for the development of stable and effective PSCs.

         <title>Nanohoops Favour Light&#8208;Induced Energy Transfer over Charge Separation in Porphyrin/[10]CPP/Fullerene Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two different nanohoops in elaborate porphyrin/(aza)[10]CPP/fullerene [2]rotaxanes (CPP: cycloparaphenylene) have been shown to act as &#8220;supramolecular shields&#8221; and completely prevent through&#8208;space electron transfer between the electron&#8208;donating porphyrin and electron&#8208;accepting fullerene. These findings shed light on some previously unexplained results and open the door for future strategic uses of strained carbon nanohoops.







Abstract
[2]Rotaxanes offer unique opportunities for studying and modulating charge separation and energy transfer, because the mechanical bond allows the robust, yet spatially dynamic tethering of photoactive groups. In this work, we synthesized [2]rotaxane triads comprising a central (aza)[10]CPP&#8835;C60 bis&#8208;adduct complex and two zinc porphyrin stoppers to address how the movable nanohoop affects light&#8208;induced charge separation and energy transfer between the rotaxane subcomponents. We found that neither the parent nanohoop [10]CPP nor its electron&#8208;deficient analogue aza[10]CPP actively participate in charge separation. In contrast, the nanohoops completely prevented through&#8208;space charge separation. This result is likely due to supramolecular &#8220;shielding&#8221;, because charge separation was observed in the thread that acted as reference dyad. On the other hand, the suppression of electron transfer allowed the observation of energy transfer from the porphyrin triplet to the fullerene triplet state with a lifetime of ca. 25&#8197;&#956;s. The presence of the interlocked nanohoops therefore leads to a dramatic switch between charge separation and energy transfer. We suggest that our results explain observations made by others in photovoltaic devices comprising nanohoops and may pave the way toward strategic uses of mechanically interlocked architectures in devices that feature (triplet) energy transfer.

         <title>A Tricyclic Framework with Integrated B&#8592;N and Cyano Dual Functionalization for Superior n&#8208;Type Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peripheral functionalization strategy is employed on the tricyclic framework anthracene by introducing dual N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 groups to develop two novel acceptors: DBNF and DBNCN, which exhibit an extended &#960;&#8208;backbone, enhanced molecular packing, and improved electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. The DBNF&#8208; and DBNCN&#8208;based copolymers, exhibit remarkable electron mobility of 3.04&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and maximum power factor of 147.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
n&#8208;Type conjugated polymers featuring low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, the synthesis of acceptors with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics presents a significant challenge. Herein, a peripheral functionalization strategy is employed on the tricyclic framework anthracene by introducing dual N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 groups to enhance its electron&#8208;withdrawing capability. This approach successfully navigates synthetic challenges, leading to the development of two novel acceptor building blocks: DBNF and DBNCN. Compared to the counterparts with a single N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 moiety, DBNF and DBNCN exhibit an extended &#960;&#8208;backbone, enhanced molecular packing, and improved electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Utilizing these innovative acceptor monomers, copolymers, PDBNF and PDBNCN, are synthesized, which exhibit considerably suppressed LUMO &#8776;&#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. The deep LUMO of PDBNF together with its favourable bimodal packing orientation leads to remarkable electron mobility of 3.04&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with improved stability in OTFTs. Importantly, efficient n&#8208;doping in OTEs is achieved with PDBNCN, exhibiting exceptional conductivity of 95.5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor of 147.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2&#8212;among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers. This work underscores the effectiveness of introducing dual B&#8592;N and cyano functionalities in attaining high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type plastic electronics.

         <title>Triplet Energy Gap&#8208;Regulated Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8211;Guest Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) is introduced to construct the organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Here, the guest's triplet state can act as the &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;. A bidirectional energy transfer process, triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (rTTET) process, has proved in host&#8211;guest doped system. When &#916;ET is large, guest's triplet state collects the triplet excitons to emit RTP but returns triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET is small.







Abstract
The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host&#8211;guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host&#8211;guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host&#8211;guest doped materials, using benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest's triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET is small. By combining the results of steady&#8208;state and delayed emission spectra, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra, and theoretical calculations, a bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer processes. The thermal equilibrium of these two energy transfer processes can be regulated by the &#916;ET and temperature. The potential applications of these RTP properties are also realized in data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides valuable insight into the design of host&#8211;guest doped materials based on energy transfer mechanisms.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. It employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as the limiting reagent and presumably involves the formation of a reactive Fe&#8208;nitrene/imidyl radical species. This operationally simple method is amenable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and APIs.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles are privileged structures in both marketed drugs and natural products. On the other hand, C&#8722;H amination reactions furnish unconventional and straightforward approaches for the construction of C&#8722;N bonds. Yet, most of the known methods rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles, catalyzed by inexpensive FeCl2, which allows the functionalization of a wide range of pharmaceutically relevant cyclic amines. The C&#8722;H amination occurs site&#8208;selectively in &#945;&#8208;position to the nitrogen atom, even when weaker C&#8722;H bonds are present, and furnishes Troc&#8208;protected aminals or amidines. The method employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as limiting reagent and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Its synthetic potential was further illustrated through the derivatization of &#945;&#8208;aminated products and the application to a concise total synthesis of the reported structure for senobtusin. Mechanistic studies allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism involving a turnover&#8208;limiting Fe&#8208;nitrene generation followed by fast H atom transfer and radical rebound.

         <title>Interdependence of Support Wettability &#8208; Electrodeposition Rate&#8208; Sodium Metal Anode and SEI Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines how current collector chemistry and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography, grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and cryogenic focused ion beam microscopy reveal differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.







Abstract
This study examines how current collector support chemistry (sodiophilic intermetallic Na2Te vs. sodiophobic baseline Cu) and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Capacity and current (6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8211;3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) representative of commercially relevant mass loading in anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AF&#8208;SMBs) are analyzed. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) are combined with cryogenic ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) microscopy. Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te&#8722;Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Dynamic Supramolecular Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomer Induced Uniform Li+ Transport and Stabilizes Interphase Ensures Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive poly(urethane&#8208;urea) interphase (DSIPI) exhibits uniform soft and hard phases, where the hard phase promptly dissociates LiTFSI. The dissociated Li+ migrates uniformly through the soft phase, while TFSI&#8722; decomposes, forming a stable polymer&#8208;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase. The DSIPI significantly improved the performance of lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Artificial polymer solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) with microphase&#8208;separated structures provide promising solutions to the inhomogeneity and cracking issues of natural SEIs in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, achieving homogeneous ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and superior interfacial stability remains challenging due to interference from hard&#8208;phase domains in ion transport and solid&#8208;solid interface issues with lithium metal. Herein, we present a dynamic supramolecular ion&#8208;conducting poly (urethane&#8208;urea) interphase (DSIPI) that achieves these three properties through modulating the hard&#8208;phase domains and constructing a composite SEI in situ. The soft&#8208;phase polytetrahydrofuran backbone, featuring loose Li+&#8722;O coordinating interactions, ensures uniform Li+ transport. Concurrently, sextuple hydrogen bonds in the hard phase dissipate strain energy through sequential bond cleavage, thereby imparting exceptional mechanical properties. Moreover, enriched bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide anion (TFSI&#8722;) in DSIPI promotes the in situ formation of a stable polymer&#8208;inorganic composite SEI during cycling. Consequently, the DSIPI&#8208;protected lithium anode (DSIPI@Li) enables symmetric cells with exceptional cyclability exceeding 4,000&#8197;hours at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, thereby demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, DSIPI@Li facilitates stable operation of the pouch cells under the constraints of a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing artificial SEIs and high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Interception of Alkynyl Tetracoordinate Borons with Sulfur Electrophiles beyond the Zweifel Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of intriguing transformations of alkynyl tetracoordinate boron compounds upon reaction with sulfur electrophiles are disclosed, in which substituted benzothiophenes, five/four&#8208;membered boracycles, and alkenyl sulfides are readily assembled under mild reaction conditions. These transformations feature novel reaction modes as well as unusual reaction mechanisms and provide valuable products with high efficiency.







Abstract
Zweifel reaction is a powerful strategy to construct olefins from alkenyl tetracoordinate borons in organoboron chemistry, however, it usually only involves one functional group migration and then undergoes an elimination process affording alkenes or alkynes exclusively. Herein, we disclose several intriguing interception of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons with sulfur electrophiles. Wherein, the substituted benzothiophenes are accessed by consecutive 1,2&#8208;migrations and intramolecular electrophilic substitution, meanwhile, the challenging and elusive five/four&#8208;membered boracycles are easily assembled, and an approach to alkenyl sulfides with good stereoselectivity was developed as well. Moreover, by adding readily available deuterium sources, the tetrasubstituted deuterated alkenyl sulfides with high deuteration rates are constructed. These protocols not only improve atom economy by prohibiting the elimination of Zweifel intermediate, but also enrich the reaction modes of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons achieving versatile value&#8208;added sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that dichlorosulfoxide (SOCl2) and dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride&#8208;type reagents (DAST&#8208;type) as surfur sources could promote dual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons, which are distinct from traditional Zweifel reaction, and the regulation of steric hindrance could also make four&#8208;membered boracycles and alkenyl sulfides feasible. And these transformations feature novel reaction modes and unusual reaction mechanisms with valuable products in high efficiency.

         <title>A Metal Chelation Therapy to Effectively Eliminate Breast Cancer and Intratumor Bacteria While Suppressing Tumor Metastasis by Copper Depletion and Zinc Ions Surge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative metal chelation therapy is proposed to inhibit the growth of tumor and intratumor F. nucleatum through copper depletion and Zn2+ surge. Meanwhile, this therapy suppresses tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the block of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum.







Abstract
The intratumor microbiota results in the immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. However, developing a synergistic therapy with antitumor, antibacterial, and antimetastatic effects faces enormous challenges. Here, we propose an innovative metal chelation therapy to effectively eliminate tumor and intratumor bacteria and suppress tumor metastasis. Different from traditional chelation therapy that only consumes metal elements, this therapy not only eliminates the crucial metal elements for tumor metabolism but also releases new metal ions with antitumor and antibacterial properties. Based on the high demand for copper in breast cancer, we prepare a fibrous therapeutic nanoagent (Zn&#8208;PEN) by chelating the copper chelator D&#8208;Penicillamine (D&#8208;PEN) with Zn2+. Firstly, Zn&#8208;PEN achieves dual inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis metabolism in breast cancer through copper depletion and Zn2+ activated cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thus inducing tumor cell death. Secondly, Zn&#8208;PEN has the capability to eradicate Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in breast cancer, thereby mitigating its immunosuppressive impact on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, Zn&#8208;PEN effectively inhibits tumor metastasis through multiple routes, including the inhibition of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, activation of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and elimination with F. nucleatum. Therefore, we verify the feasibility of Zn&#8208;PEN mediated metal chelation therapy in a 4T1 model infected with F. nucleatum, providing a new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor metastasis.

         <title>Controlling the Polarity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present study, a series of polar functional group&#8208;grafted MOFs (polarized MOFs) were constructed using a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy, and their pore structures were then used to activate CO2 molecules under ECR conditions. We found that the ECR performance for the polarized MOFs significantly depended on the incorporated polar substituents. This phenomenon simultaneously stemmed from the charge redistribution and mass transfer of CO2 in the micropores of the polarized MOFs.







Abstract
The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs with polar&#160;functional groups to activate&#160;CO2&#160;has not been investigated&#160;in&#160;the context of&#160;CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we&#160;report&#160;a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy&#160;to&#160;incorporate&#160;various functional groups in the MOFs.&#160;We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased&#160;catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental&#160;and theoretical evidence&#160;indicates&#160;that&#160;the presence of&#160;polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution&#160;in the micropores of&#160;MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands&#160;reduces&#160;the energy barrier to generate *COOH,&#160;which&#160;is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2. Our&#160;research&#160;offers an effective method of&#160;disrupting&#160;local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO2 under electrochemical conditions.

         <title>Modifications of Prenyl Side Chains in Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the unique modifications of prenyl side chains involved in natural product biosynthesis, including epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the enzymatic machinery responsible for the modifications of prenyl side chains and elucidating their roles in natural product biosynthesis. This interest stems from the pivotal role such modifications play in shaping the structural and functional diversity of natural products, as well as from their potential applications to synthetic biology and drug discovery. In addition to contributing to the diversity and complexity of natural products, unique modifications of prenyl side chains are represented by several novel biosynthetic mechanisms. Representative unique examples of epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization are summarized and discussed. By revealing the intriguing chemistry and enzymology behind these transformations, this comprehensive and comparative review will guide future efforts in the discovery, characterization and application of modifications of prenyl side chains in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; shows that the {Zn(hmds)} 12&#8208;electron fragment is perfectly suited for stabilizing a heretofore only theoretically predicted boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit. Comprehensive DFT calculations corroborate that fine&#8208;tuning of the charge and shape of {Bi6} moieties in heterometallic clusters are responsive to the nature of (electron&#8208;withdrawing) transition metal complex fragments coordinated by this unit.







Abstract
Molecules based on polyatomic bismuth substructures are currently attracting a lot of attention owing to this heavy and essentially non&#8208;toxic element's uncommon chemical and physical properties, which include unprecedented bonding properties. Hexaatomic {Bi6} substructures that underly more complex cluster structures were recently reported to adopt different structures or exhibit different structural details as a consequence of the charge of the {Bi6} unit. This leads to either crown&#8208;shaped cycles for a nominal Bi66&#8722; or differently distorted trigonal prisms for compositions close to Bi62&#8722;. It was predicted by quantum chemistry that Bi64&#8722; should adopt a distinctly distorted boat&#8208;like shape, yet a corresponding compound has remained elusive. Here, we report a proof of this assumption by the synthesis of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]2[Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5THF (1), comprising a bimetallic [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; cluster that fulfills the prediction for the geometric and electronic structure of the missing link (crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[8.8.8]hexa&#8208;cosane, hmds=hexamethyldisilazanid). A detailed quantum chemical study shows how the nature of Lewis&#8208;acidic transition metal complexes&#8212;in particular, 12&#8208;electron fragments&#8212;control and fine&#8208;tune the resulting {Bi6} architectures in accordance with the degree of electron&#8208;withdrawal from the polybismuthide core.

         <title>Actuation Performance and Versatility of Photothermally Driven Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to photochemical reactions, which are the conventional mechanisms used to actuate photomechanical crystals, both the photothermal effect and natural vibration allow all crystals to absorb light at higher speeds over a wider range of light wavelengths, from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared. These two novel mechanisms could advance the research on photomechanical crystals from the field of fundamental chemistry to engineering and applied research.







Abstract
Photomechanical crystals exhibit mechanical motion upon light irradiation and may thus find applications as actuators. Over the last decades, many photomechanical organic crystals have been developed, commonly via photochemical reactions, particularly photoisomerization. However, photochemical crystal actuation is associated with several drawbacks, including a limited number of available crystals, slow actuation speed (&lt;5&#8197;Hz), and narrow wavelength range (&lt;550&#8197;nm). Such constraints have hindered the widespread use of crystals as actuation materials. In this minireview, we focus on crystal actuation by employing more universal physical phenomena (the photothermal effect and photothermally resonated natural vibration) and quantitatively evaluate actuation performance. Both mechanisms, particularly the latter, outperformed conventional photomechanical crystal activation in terms of both speed (maximum: 1,350&#8197;Hz) and the useful wavelength range (ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared). The oscillation frequencies of the crystals exceeded those of polymers, efficiently filling the gap between soft and hard materials. Both the photothermal effect and natural vibration can actuate any crystal that absorbs light. These two versatile physical actuation mechanisms could expand 40&#8197;years of research on photomechanical crystals&#8212;which had been based on photochemical reactions&#8212;from the realm of chemistry into engineering and lead to their practical applications in actuators and soft robots.

         <title>The Fischer&#8208;Lactonization&#8208;Driven Mechanism for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a Fischer&#8208;lactonisation&#8208;driven mechanism based on the nucleophilic substitution principle for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. The unique property of citric acid was exploited, which can be used as both a leaching and chelating agent, to induce chelation and further precipitation by precisely controlling its solution concentration. This mechanism mainly takes advantage of the nucleophilic attack between the carbon atom in the protonated carboxyl ion (&#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722;) on the citric acid chelate and the lone pair of electrons in its hydroxyl to promote the generation of the ester bond, thus forming the lactonized gel, which genuinely brings out the advantages of the bifunctionality of citric acid as a leaching agent and a chelating agent simultaneously. In this study, our innovative strategy enhances the simplicity and flexibility of traditional hydrometallurgical processes by eliminating the cumbersome separation and extraction procedures. Compared to traditional sol&#8208;gel methods, the strategy avoids the usage of large amounts of citric acid while eliminating the highly polluting part of pH adjustment by ammonia, allowing spontaneous gel formation in the original acidic environment. Most importantly, the strategy is further upgraded from the existing modification methods by eliminating the need to introduce additional alcohol solvents to provide the required alcohol for the lactonization reaction, thus reducing the consumption of organic solvents and improving the environmental friendliness of the process.







Abstract
Hydrometallurgy remains a major challenge to simplify its complex separation and precipitation processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we propose a Fischer&#8208;lactonization&#8208;driven mechanism for the cascade reaction of leaching and chelation of spent LIBs. Citric acid undergoes a two&#8208;step dissociation of the carboxylic acid (&#8722;COOH) and complexes with the leached metal ion, while the residual &#8722;COOH is attacked by H protons to form a protonated carboxyl ion (&#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722;). Subsequently, the lone pair of electrons in the hydroxyl of the same molecule attack the carbon atom in &#8722;COO&#8201;&#8722; to facilitate ester bonding, leading to the formation of a lactonized gel. The leaching rates of Li, Ni, Co and Mn are 99.3, 99.1, 99.5 and 99.2&#8201;%, respectively. The regenerated monocrystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) has a uniform particle size distribution and complete lamellar structure, with a capacity retention rate of 70.6&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. The mechanism achieves a one&#8208;step chelation reaction, and the energy consumption and carbon emissions are only 26&#8201;% and 44&#8201;%, respectively, of that of the conventional hydrometallurgical. The strategy achieves a double breakthrough in simplifying the process and improving environmental friendliness, offering a sustainable approach to the re&#8208;utilization of spent LIBs.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vacancy and water&#8208;free silver hexacyanoferrate cathode (K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework, exhibiting a notable reversible capacity of 179.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 through a four&#8208;electron transfer mechanism involving the redox reactions of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag0.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been employed as host materials of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), however, they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to limited electron transfer and the presence of interstitial water in PBAs.

         <title>Iron Oxide Clusters as Electron Donors Under Light Enhance Oxygen Reduction Kinetics at Atomically Dispersed Fe for Photocatalytic CH4 Partial Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe SA&#8722;NC/C3N4 demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity for photocatalytic methane partial oxidation. Fe2O3 nanoclusters play a similar role as NADH coenzyme in soluble methane monooxygenase that continuously provide electrons under the illumination to the satellite Fe single atom sites, promoting O2 activation and subsequent CH4 oxidation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to CH3OH emerges as a promising strategy to sustainably utilize natural gas and mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, there remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of methanol by using O2 at low temperature. Inspired by the catalytic structure in soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) and the corresponding reaction mechanism, we prepared a biomimetic photocatalyst with the decoration of Fe2O3 nanoclusters and satellite Fe single atoms immobilized on carbon nitride. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity of 5.02&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with CH3OH selectivity of 98.5&#8201;%. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergy between Fe2O3 nanoclusters and Fe single atoms establishes a dual&#8208;Fe site as MMO for O2 activation and subsequent CH4 partial oxidation. Moreover, the light excitation of Fe2O3 nanoclusters with a relative narrow band gap could deliver the electrons and protons to atomic Fe that facilitating the oxygen reduction kinetics for the robust of CH3OH synthesis.

         <title>Inverse Design of Singlet&#8208;Fission Materials with Uncertainty&#8208;Controlled Genetic Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncover candidates for singlet fission using a machine learning&#8208;driven uncertainty&#8208;controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA), which is run either in an exploitative or explorative manner. Leveraging a fragment database (reFORMED) derived from crystal structure data, we propose a class of heteroatom&#8208;rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge&#8208;transfer mediated singlet fission.







Abstract
Singlet fission has shown potential for boosting the efficiency of solar cells, but the scarcity of suitable molecular materials hinders its implementation. We introduce an uncertainty&#8208;controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom&#8208;rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge&#8208;transfer mediated singlet fission. When included in larger donor&#8208;acceptor systems, these units exhibit localization of the triplet state, favorable diradicaloid character and suitable triplet energies for exciton injection into semiconductor solar cells.

         <title>Resolving Structures of Paramagnetic Systems in Chemistry and Materials Science by Solid&#8208;State NMR: The Revolving Power of Ultra&#8208;Fast MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) over 100&#8197;kHz has transformed solid&#8208;state NMR for biomolecules but struggled with paramagnetic powders due to rotor size and sensitivity issues. Advances now permit routine analysis of sensitive samples, enhancing spectral resolution and overcoming past limitations. This enables precise characterization of paramagnetic systems&#8242; structures and properties, crucial for catalysts and battery materials, demonstrated on various complex materials.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100+kHz) has revolutionized solid&#8208;state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast&#8208;spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, and are associated with low sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra&#8208;fast 100+kHz MAS allows site&#8208;specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. Combined with more reliable rotor materials and handling methods, this opens the way to the routine characterization of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb3+ complex, an air&#8208;sensitive homogeneous high&#8208;spin Fe2+ catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe2+/Mn2+/Mg2+ olivine&#8208;type cathode materials.

         <title>d&#8208;Electrons of Platinum Alloy Steering CO Pathway for Low&#8208;Charge Potential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation of C and Li2CO3 is characterized by sluggish kinetics and unfavorable thermodynamics. Herein, the reaction pathway is successfully steered to a kinetically and thermodynamically favorable gas&#8208;solid reaction between CO and Li2CO3 by optimizing the Pt d&#8208;electron configuration. This strategy effectively improves the energy efficiency and cycle life of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from sluggish solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation kinetics of C and Li2CO3, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt d&#8208;electrons and develop an aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 battery with CO and Li2CO3 as the main discharge products. Note that the gas&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation reaction between CO and Li2CO3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with CoPt alloy&#8208;supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89&#8197;V at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218&#8197;cycles at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6&#8201;%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered d&#8208;band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO&#8208;selective Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aprotic Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries suffer from sluggish solid-solid co-oxidation kinetics of C and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-electrons and develop an aprotic Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with CO and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the main discharge products. Note that the gas-solid co-oxidation reaction between CO and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with CoPt alloy-supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89&#8197;V at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218&#8197;cycles at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6&#8201;%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO-selective Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodine Boosted Fluoro&#8208;Organic Borate Electrolytes Enabling Fluent Ion&#8208;conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries are regarded as a promising multi&#8208;valent battery system for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage applications. Boron&#8208;based magnesium salts with terminal substituent fluorinated anions (Mg[B(ORF)4]2, RF = fluorinated alkyl) have exhibited impressive electrochemical stability. Nevertheless, their deployment is hindered by the complicated synthesis routes and the surface passivation of Mg&#160;anode. Herein, we report the design of an advanced electrolyte formulation comprised of B(HFIP)3&#160;and I2&#160;in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), which eventually convert into a Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte system upon interacting with Mg anode. The Mg anode reacts with I2 and the electron&#8208;accepting B(HFIP)3, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer composed of MgF2 and MgI2 species that can facilitate fast and stable Mg plating/stripping. Compared with the pristine Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME electrolyte, the Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte exhibited superior electrochemical performance including an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (~80 mV), high Coulombic efficiency and a long&#8208;cycling period over 1500 h. In result, the rechargeable magnesium batteries with Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte and Mo6S8 cathode show outstanding compatibility, rapid kinetics, and stable cyclability for over 1200 cycles, surpassing all previously reported boron&#8208;based electrolytes. This work introduces a promising halogen&#8208;enhancement strategy for boron&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolytes and is pivotal for the advancement and optimization of multi&#8208;valent secondary batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Ligand&#8208;Nonbridging Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Lithium Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are lagging in the use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), ascribing to full coordination between metal nodes and organic ligands, to a large extent. By integrating a modulator into a ligand with missing bridging functionality, this study elucidates the role of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in MOFs in tailoring lithium storage performance. A fully bridged pristine MOF (p&#8208;MOF) utilizing the meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl) porphyrin ligand is compared with a modified MOF containing non&#8208;bridging defects (d&#8208;MOF) introduced by a homologous ligand, tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin. Spectroscopic and cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques verify the presence of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in the d&#8208;MOF and reveal their explicit local structure. Density functional theory calculations show significantly enhanced Li+ adsorption energies and reduced Li+ migration barriers at the non&#8208;bridging sites in the d&#8208;MOF compared to the fully bridging sites in the p&#8208;MOF. As a result, the d&#8208;MOF exhibits exceptional lithium storage performance, achieving a high capacity of 761 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1, which substantially outperform the p&#8208;MOF. This study highlights the potential of modulating MOFs with non&#8208;bridging defects to develop high&#8208;performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional, fluorene&#8208;based modulator of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission as a novel drug candidate for palliative treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Given that cholinergic neurons are predominantly affected in AD, current treatments primarily aim to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. However, imbalances in other neurotransmitters, such as &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA), also contribute to AD symptomatology. In the presented research, by using a combination of crystallography and computational methods we developed 6 as a dual modulator of GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems. Compound 6 demonstrated inhibition of BuChE (IC50 = 0.21 &#956;M) and GABA transporter 1 (IC50 = 10.96 &#956;M) and 3 (IC50 = 7.76 &#956;M), along with a favorable drug&#8208;likeness profile. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed effectiveness of 6 in enhancing memory retention and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in animal models, while also proving safe and bioavailable for oral administration. The innovative multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligand 6 offers a new approach to treating cognitive deficits and BPSD in AD.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve unprecedented terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers and their monomers were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27, which represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. Mechanically, DCTPP1 was a novel potential clinically effective biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.







Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small-molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene-nonadride heterodimers (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;) and their monomers (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt;) were isolated from endophyte &lt;i&gt;Bipolaris victoriae&lt;/i&gt; S27. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt; represented the first example of terpene-nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer&#8208;Based Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an Aptamer&#8208;based and Urease&#8208;mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.







Abstract
Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000&#8208;fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.

     alt="Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer-Based Litmus Test"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created an Aptamer-based and Urease-mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2&amp;amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000-fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS-CoV-2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl&#8208;ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3&#8208;helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8&#8208;ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

&lt;p&gt;We report non-nephrotoxic &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine-appended, bacteria-targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click-to-release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof-of-concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two-component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hyperconjugation&#8208;Driven Isodesmic Reaction of Indoles and Anilines: Reaction Discovery, Mechanism Study, and Antitumor Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines was developed in this work. The &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation between alkyl group and indole ring was identified as the driving force of this transformation through theoretical and experimental studies. The developed methodology was applied to obtain antitumor quindoline derivatives that exhibited substantial activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo models.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional&#8208;group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers.







Abstract
Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.

&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines are valuable blocks in various biologically active molecules. An efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination system was developed for preparing the chiral moieties with high diastereo&#8208;, enantioselectivity and a large substrate scope.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion.

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-into-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+ oxygenates&lt;/sub&gt; to FE&lt;sub&gt;ethylene&lt;/sub&gt; up to 2.36. At this condition, the C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, morphologies, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polyimide film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.







Abstract
Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.

         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an efficient strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of pyridines using transient enamine&#8208;type intermediates from N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process utilizes EDA complexes, achieving high selectivity without external photocatalysts. Our method offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities that expand the pyridine modification toolbox and provide access to challenging meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst. The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.

         <title>Efficient Derivatization of a Thienobenzobisthiazole&#8208;Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Towards High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers based on thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) with alkyl, ester, and acyl groups are synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy, where the TBTz&#8208;monomers are efficiently synthesized via the common intermediate. Among them, the ester&#8208;functionalized polymer shows the highest power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic cells with a small nonradiative voltage loss and a high charge generation efficiency.







Abstract
Derivatization is essential for optimizing organic material properties. However, because functional groups are often introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, similar intermediates have to be repeatedly synthesized to produce derivatives, which amounts to a daunting and time&#8208;consuming task. Using thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) as a building unit of donor polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we demonstrate an efficient derivatization of a TBTz&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer by late&#8208;stage functionalization. In the developed synthetic route, functional groups are introduced at the last step of monomer synthesis, enabling us to easily synthesize several derivatives from a common intermediate. Ester and acyl groups are introduced into the polymer instead of the alkyl group, giving rise to deep HOMO energy levels and resulting in OPV cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage even in the absence of halogen substituents that are typically introduced into the donor polymers. Notably, the ester&#8208;functionalized TBTz&#8208;based polymer shows a small nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) of 0.19&#8197;V and has one of the highest charge generation efficiencies among the halogen&#8208;free donor polymers with similar &#916;Vnr, improving the critical trade&#8208;off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high&#8208;performance polymers for OPVs.

&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;, improving the critical trade-off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high-performance polymers for OPVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the dual effects of incorporating active LMs into solid&#8208;state composite PEO electrolytes, including providing additional free volume for segmental relaxation to enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity and acting as dynamic chemical traps to realize self&#8208;healing protection against dendritic problems. These combined effects enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells with notable rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>A Fluorinated Imide&#8208;Functionalized Arene Enabling a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor for Record&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms were introduced at the &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. The SA1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved a record efficiency of 19.33&#8201;% (certified PCE: 19.17&#8201;%). These results highlight that F&#8208;BTI is a promising unit for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer donors for all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) present compelling advantages for commercial applications, including mechanical durability and optical and thermal stability. However, progress in developing high&#8208;performance polymer donors has trailed behind the emergence of excellent polymer acceptors. In this study, we report a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms are introduced at the outer &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. SA1 exhibits a deep HOMO level of &#8722;5.51&#8197;eV, a wide bandgap of 1.81&#8197;eV and suitable miscibility with the polymer acceptor. Polymer chains incorporating F&#8208;BTI result in a highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within the all&#8208;polymer active layer. Thus, SA1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 16.31&#8201;% with excellent stability, which is further enhanced to a record value of 19.33&#8201;% (certified: 19.17&#8201;%) by constructing ternary device. This work demonstrates that F&#8208;BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F&#8208;BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Lodged High&#8208;Valent High&#8208;Entropy Layered Double Hydroxide for Efficient, Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a convenient multi&#8208;ionic co&#8208;precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&#8722; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8722; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).

Here, a low-cost fluorine-lodged high-valent high-entropy layered double hydroxide (HV-HE-LDH) (FeCoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is conveniently prepared through multi-ions co-precipitation, where F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal-oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) in FeCoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; prevent structural reorganization, rendering long-term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three-phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round-trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and long-term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi&#8208;planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular stacking in Z&#8208;W&#8208;03. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro&#8208;type HTMs incorporating quasi&#8208;planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol constructs a sieving&#8208;type EDL through strong hydrogen bond interlocking, which can reduce the presence of H2O and SO42&#8722; at the interface to inhibit side effects. It also restricts the diffusion of SO42&#8722;, thereby increasing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Therefore, the electrolyte containing SDE significantly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8722; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8722; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8722; can trap H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8722; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500&#8197;h and 2500&#8197;cycles respectively.

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

A general and modular synthetic strategy for covalent organic cages is reported. These cage receptors possess customized skeletons and sizes, diverse 3D structures, and excellent host&#8208;guest recognition for neutral aromatic diimides.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Unraveling the Anionic Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; uptake/release in the aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries is firstly deciphered; together with the Mn redox reaction accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, the tailored manganese deficient MnO2 cathode with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; achieves an ultrahigh energy density and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability.







Abstract
Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra&#8208;capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO2&#8208;based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO2 micro&#8208;nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; (CaMnO&#8208;140) are prepared via a low&#8208;temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non&#8208;bonding O 2p states, the pre&#8208;intercalated Ca2+ can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO&#8208;140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch&#8208;type CaMnO&#8208;140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high&#8208;energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coactivation pathway on shortened Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ti sites for superior &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface-confined &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface-confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to yield &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an outstanding &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

         <title>Fully sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Multiple Active Sites for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Regulating Nucleic Acid Catalysis Using Active Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we use active, fuel&#8208;dependent complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles and spatiotemporally control the catalytic activity of the 17E DNAzyme. Partitioning the biocatalyst into the peptide&#8208;RNA droplets results in unfolding and activity loss. The catalytic activity is recovered after droplets transiently dissolve when fuel is used up, mimicking they dynamic regulation of biocatalytic pathways in membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro&#8208;Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing Eb, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the Eb. Single&#8208;component and bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by ITIC, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two ITIC&#8208;based NFAs bearing spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named SpiroT&#8208;DCI and SpiroF&#8208;DCI) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of SpiroF&#8208;DCI and ITIC are delocalized in the main &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, the HOMO of SpiroT&#8208;DCI is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, SpiroT&#8208;DCI exhibits a smaller Eb than either SpiroF&#8208;DCI or ITIC, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single&#8208;component OSCs. Furthermore, SpiroT&#8208;DCI shows improved PCEs for bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB&#8208;T, compared with that of either SpiroT&#8208;DCI or ITIC. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo&#8208;induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine SpiroT&#8208;DCI films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of ITIC, which is desirable for reducing the Eb and improving the PCE in OSCs.

     alt="Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro-Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciton binding energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) is a key parameter for efficient charge-carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro-substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. Single-component and bulk-heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by &lt;b&gt;ITIC&lt;/b&gt;, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two &lt;b&gt;ITIC&lt;/b&gt;-based NFAs bearing spiro-substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named &lt;b&gt;SpiroT-DCI&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;SpiroF-DCI&lt;/b&gt;) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of &lt;b&gt;SpiroF-DCI&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;ITIC&lt;/b&gt; are delocalized in the main &#960;-conjugated framework, the HOMO of &lt;b&gt;SpiroT-DCI&lt;/b&gt; is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, &lt;b&gt;SpiroT-DCI&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a smaller &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; than either &lt;b&gt;SpiroF-DCI&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;ITIC&lt;/b&gt;, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single-component OSCs. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;SpiroT-DCI&lt;/b&gt; shows improved PCEs for bulk-heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB-T, compared with that of either &lt;b&gt;SpiroT-DCI&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;ITIC&lt;/b&gt;. Time-resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo-induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine &lt;b&gt;SpiroT-DCI&lt;/b&gt; films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro-substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of &lt;b&gt;ITIC&lt;/b&gt;, which is desirable for reducing the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and improving the PCE in OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes is reported and enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under ligand&#8208;free conditions. Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles is achieved with chiral bisoxazoline ligands, providing access to &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.







Abstract
C(sp3) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand&#8208;free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal-hydride-catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel-hydride-catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;-selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand-free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio- and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;-branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;Induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The red delayed fluorescence polymer incorporating tetracoordinate boron were developed to study the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior. Modulating the emission wavelength of polymer depends on the solvent's electronic effects, which induce the equilibrium of the electrostatic potential distribution of fluorophore, as well as the strong intramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Tuning full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm with quantum yield of 9.15&#8201;% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588&#8197;nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.

         <title>Vertically Fluorinated Graphene Encapsulated SiOx Anode for Enhanced Li+ Transport and Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertically fluorinated graphene encapsulated SiOx anode with ultra&#8208;fast Li+ transfer and interfacial stability for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries was developed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of surface fluorination for the construction of LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interfaces.







Abstract
Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8722;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8197;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8722;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8722;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C in the SiOx@vG&#8722;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Allenylation</title>

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NC surface transformed into high-valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR (*NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathway on CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NC starting with NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; conversion to *NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species, leading to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery utilizing the CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open-circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and producing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This study highlights the innovative use of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost-effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an arginine (Arg) residue adjacent to the latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa) significantly accelerates both SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This offers a general and biocompatible strategy to harness these robust click chemistries for fundamental and applied biological research, applicable in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.

         <title>Screening Strategy Identifies an Overlooked Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a strategy focusing on polar axial symmetry, a DUV transparent NLO crystal Mg2PO4Cl was discovered after screening over 10,000 phosphates. This crystal exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV compounds. Such a remarkable SHG effect can be attributed to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis.







Abstract
In the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) region, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals must meet stringent requirements, including a large optical band gap and sufficient second harmonic generation (SHG) response. Typically, these criteria are fulfilled by borates, carbonates and nitrates containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups. In contrast, sulfates and phosphates, with polarizabilities significantly smaller than those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, struggle to achieve similar performance. Here, we present the discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, a magnesium&#8208;based phosphate, identified from over 10,000 phosphates based on a polar&#8208;axial&#8208;symmetry screening strategy, which exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV transparent NLO crystals. This compound belongs to the Pna21 space group, with [PO4] units consistently aligned along the 21 screw axis and glide planes throughout its crystal structure. Theoretical calculations attribute its remarkable SHG effect to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis. Furthermore, a crystallographic structure analysis of phosphates and sulfates with significant SHG effects validates the effectiveness of our screening strategy. These findings offer valuable insights into the origins of NLO effects in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds from both a material design and structural chemistry perspective, inspiring future efforts to revitalize DUV phosphates.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO2 by MoO3&#8208;stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

&lt;p&gt;An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium-based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: Fact or Fiction? Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that contrary to literature reports the putative gold&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction is a two&#8208;stage process: gold&#8208;based heteroarylation followed by gold&#8208;free carbocationic rearrangements to olefins and tetrahydronaphthalenes.







Abstract
Two recent high&#8208;profile publications reported the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by MeDalPhosAuCl/AgOTf (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 8810) and their cyclisation to tetralines (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202312786). It was claimed that these were the first demonstrations in gold catalysis of alkene insertion into Au&#8208;aryl bonds, &#946;&#8208;H elimination and chain&#8208;walking by Au&#8722;H dications. We show here that in fact this chemistry is a two&#8208;stage process. Only the first step, the production of an alkyl triflate ester as the primary organic product by the well&#8208;known alkene heteroarylation sequence, involves gold. The subsequent formation of Heck&#8208;type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H+&#8208;triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]2+ dication have no basis in fact.

Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

Small Fish, big moves In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry has brought a revolution in our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems. However, the toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions is yet very limited. The field of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of mild and biocompatible chemical reactions, and thereby expanding the repertoire of bioorthogonal tools. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential for the selective generation of designed products within biorelevant or living settings.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems at the molecular level. However, the range of chemical reactions that can operate efficiently in biological environments without interfering with the native cellular machinery, remains limited. In this context, the rapidly growing area of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of bioorthogonal tools. The inherent mildness, tunability, chemoselectivity, and external controllability of photocatalytic transformations make them particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in biological and living systems. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential to enable the selective generation of designed products within biologically relevant or living settings.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8722;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8722; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&#8722; binding to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have rethought the role of Cl&#8722; ions, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

As one of the central molecules for life, RNA is connected to various processes involved in disease. Achieving a targeted, specific and irreversible RNA degradation is both a challenge and a highly valuable goal for pushing forward the development of new therapeutics. This minireview aims to summarize and provide mechanistic insights into every approach so far to drug and irreversibly degrade disease&#8208;associated RNA using small molecules.







Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing an anthracene&#8208;based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high&#8208;yielding synthetic method for P&#8208;doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end&#8208;capping (thio)xanthyl unit.







Abstract
Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox&#8208;couple.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Protocol to Access Silacyclobutanes with Unprecedented Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control.







Abstract
Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.

Ion&#8208;Pair Catalysis. A sustainable protocol that metal&#8208;free deuteration employing ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; catalysis, facilitating selective substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium in arenes, with broad compatibility and high yields, was reported.







Abstract
A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method&#8216;s practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8197;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8722;H&#8722;Zn interaction.

This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Copper Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyrimidinyl Phosphine with both Axial and P&#8208;Stereogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the first NHC ligand&#8208;enabled Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction to obtain axial and P&#8208;chiral phosphines. The product can undergo a SNAr reaction with many nucleophiles for the rapid synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.

         <title>Integration of Plasmonic Ag(I) Clusters and Fe(II) Porphyrinates into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupling with Photosynthesis of Pure H2O2</title>

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

We successfully synthesized Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 catalysts with Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2 for the electroreduction of CO2, which exhibited excellent FEC2+ and FEEtOH. The coordinated tandem action of the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites enhanced the adsorption of the *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization, while stabilizing the crucial intermediate *CH2CHO, leading to improved selectivity towards C2+ and EtOH.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2 (Pz=Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9&#8201;% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5&#8201;% with remarkable stability when using 0.1&#8197;M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization on the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites play a synergistic tandem role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Acyclic 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl Alkenes as Limiting Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.

This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles.

         <title>Coupling Rotary Motion to Helicene Inversion within a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Towards complex coupled molecular motions, the remote handedness inversion of a helicene moiety was achieved by a rotary molecular motor. The use of a specifically engineered dynamic helicene stator in a novel overcrowded&#8208;alkene second&#8208;generation molecular motor based on a fluorinated dibenzofluorene fragment allows for an unprecedented control over helicity inversion. This is achieved by the mechanical coupling of the rotation of the rotor to the helicene inversion of the stator half via a remote chirality transmission process. Thus, the unidirectional rotary motion generated upon irradiation is used to invert the dynamic stereochemistry of a helicene, leading to a 6&#8208;steps cycle with eight intermediates. In this cycle, both alternation between P and M configurations of the helicene stator and dynamic thermal interconversion (paddling motion) can be achieved. In&#8208;depth computational and spectroscopic studies were performed to support the associated mechanism. The control over coupled motion and dynamic helicity offers prospects for the development of complex responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Physical Isolation of Single Protein Molecules within Well&#8208;Defined Coordination Cages to Enhance Their Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encapsulation of a single protein within a confined space can lead to distinct properties compared to bulk solutions, but controlling the number of encapsulated proteins and their environment remains challenging. This study demonstrates the encapsulation of single proteins within well&#8208;defined, tunable cavities of self&#8208;assembled coordination cages, thereby enhancing protein stability. Within uniform cavities of size&#8208;tunable coordination cages, 15 different proteins of varying sizes (3&#8208;6 nm in diameter) and properties (e.g., isoelectric points and hydrophobicity) were successfully confined. Various analytical techniques confirmed that the proteins maintained their secondary structures and enzymatic activities under denaturing conditions such as exposure to organic solvents, heat, and buffers. These findings suggest that such coordination cages have the potential to serve as synthetic hosts for precisely controlling protein functions within their customizable cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Crafting Molecular Tools for 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 in a Single Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule modulators are powerful tools for selectively probing and manipulating proteins in native biological systems. However, the development of versatile modulators that exhibit desired properties is hindered by the lack of a rapid and robust synthetic strategy. Here, we develop a facile and reliable one&#8208;step methodology for the generation of multifunctional toolboxes encompassing a wide variety of chemical modulators with different desired features. These modulators bind irreversibly to the protein target via a selective warhead. Key elements are introduced onto the warhead in a single step using multi&#8208;component reactions. To illustrate the power of this new technology, we synthesized a library of diverse modulators designed to explore a highly challenging and poorly understood protein, human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1. Modulators made include; activity&#8208;based/photoaffinity probes, chemosensors, photocrosslinkers, as well as light&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;affinity inhibitors. The efficacy of our compounds was successfully established through the provision of on demand inhibition and labeling of our target protein&#160;in vitro,&#160;in cellulo&#160;and&#160;in vivo; thus, proving that this technology has promising potential for applications in many complex biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared to Blue Photon Upconversion by Ultrafast Spin Flip and Triplet Energy Transfer at Organic/2D Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid state photon upconversion by triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion, holds instant promise for enhancing optoelectronic and photochemical applications. Despite extensive studies, NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion has remained particularly challenging and elusive due to inherent multiple energy&#8208;downhill processes in TTA upconversion. In this study, using atomically thin two dimensional (2D) monolayer semiconductor as a triplet sensitizer, we demonstrate an efficient and robust solid&#8208;state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion system. The ultrathin and flexible organic/2D bilayer heterostructure exhibits a NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion with high quantum yield (&#934;UC = 1.2%, out of 50%), low threshold power density (Ith = 110 mW/cm2) and a record&#8208;high apparent anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.12 eV. Further spin&#8208; and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast (&lt; 500 fs) electron spin flip to triplet&#8208;like excitons in semiconductor sensitizer and subsequent picosecond (~ 6&#215;1010 s&#8208;1) interfacial dexter energy transfer to annihilator molecules. The triplet energy transfer rate and efficiency depend strongly on driving force, exhibiting Marcus normal region behavior. This work demonstrates 2D monolayer semiconductor as a superior ultrathin light harvesting and triplet sensitization layer and reveals the key knob to overcome the compromise between upconversion efficiency and energy loss, offering a viable pathway to efficient solid state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion and implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy MAX Phases and Their Derivative MXenes for Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy materials hold immense promise for energy storage, owing to their varied compositions and unforeseen physicochemical properties, yet, which poses challenges in synthesis due to tendentious phase separation and extended sintering durations. Herein, an ultra&#8208;rapid strategy based on spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques is proposed to synthesize high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15 minutes, including a new phase of (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and several phases of 413&#8208;type TiVNbMoAlC3, TiVCrMoAlC3 and (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)4AlC3, achieving utmost purity level up to 99.54%. Under high temperature, the overfeed of Al with low melt point (~660&#176;C) can foster a liquid environment, which remits the immiscibility among starting materials and benefits to diffusion dynamics to some extents. Theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the thermodynamic preponderance of high&#8208;entropy MAX phases in the intricate multi&#8208;element systems. Meanwhile, the varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes can be observed directly at the atomic level. Moreover, four high&#8208;entropy MXenes as electrode materials were investigated for rechargeable batteries. Among them, TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) with outstanding stability for over 170 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6&#160;octahedrons to&#160;CrO4&#160;tetrahedrons.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high-throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) with outstanding stability for over 170 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2. Soft X-ray absorption- and Raman-spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope-labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6&#160;octahedrons to&#160;CrO4&#160;tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non-bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8211;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Chiral 2&#8208;Azetines and Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Allenes via Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral 2&#8208;azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2&#8208;azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2&#8208;azetines (70&#8211;98% yields and up to 96% ee) through chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines. These 2&#8208;azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et3SiH, BF3&#8226;Et2O and water at rt for 2 minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones and sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring&#8208;opening reaction through Et3SiH, BF3&#8226;Et2O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90% yields and up to 91% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption Kinetics and Capacity of a Stable CeF3@Ni3N Heterostructure for Methanol Electro&#8208;Reforming Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline methanol&#8208;water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro&#8208;reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy&#8208;consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)2 lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH&#8208;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43 V at 500 mA cm&#8208;2, along with high stability over 72 h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76 mV to achieve 50 mA cm&#8208;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane&#8208;free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long&#8208;term stability and FEs at high current density of 300 mA cm&#8208;2. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by&#160;operando&#160;EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and Mg tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>A Detailed View on the (Re)isomerization Dynamics in Microbial Rhodopsins using Complementary Near&#8208;UV and IR Readouts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomerization is a key process in many (bio)chemical systems. In microbial rhodopsins, the photoinduced isomerization of the all&#8208;trans retinal to the 13&#8208;cis isomer initiates a cascade of structural changes of the protein. The interplay between these changes and the thermal relaxation of the isomerized retinal is one of the crucial determinants for rhodopsin functionality. It is therefore important to probe this dynamic interplay with chromophore specific markers that combine gapless temporal observation with spectral sensitivity. Here we utilize the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region in the framework of a systematic (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic study on H+&#8208; (HsBR, (G)PR), Na+&#8208; (KR2, ErNaR) and Cl&#8208;&#8208; (NmClR) pumps. We demonstrate that the near&#8208;UV region is an excellent probe for retinal configuration and &#8208; being sensitive to the electrostatic environment of retinal &#8208; even transient ion binding, which allows us to pinpoint protein specific mechanistic nuances and chromophore&#8208;charge interactions. The combination of the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region hence provides a spectroscopic analysis tool that allows a detailed, precise and temporally fully resolved description of retinal configurations during all stages of the photocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Mediated f&#8208;p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling: Achieving Selective Seawater Oxidation and Breaking *OH and *OOH Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we have developed a NiFelDH&#8208;FLPs electrocatalyst based on frustrated Lewis acidic&#8208;basic pairs (FLPs) for seawater oxidation for the first time. Based on the soft hard acid&#8208;base theory, the Lewis acidic sites of FLPs exhibit a strong affinity for OH&#8722;, while the Lewis basic sites demonstrate resistance to Cl&#8722;. Consequently, during the process of seawater electrolysis, the ClOR on the catalyst surface are effectively inhibited due to the existence of FLPs sites.







Abstract
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis plays a crucial role in producing renewable hydrogen energy. However, during the seawater electrolysis process, the anode inevitably undergoes chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) due to Cl&#8722; adsorption, making the seawater electrolysis process difficult to sustain. Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we propose a biomimetic design of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) layers for selective seawater oxidation. Combining experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been demonstrated that cerium dioxide layers with FLPs sites can decompose water molecules, capture hydroxyl anions, and repel chloride ions simultaneously. DFT theoretical analysis indicates that the FLP sites regulate the Ce&#8197;4&#8201;f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Ni&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling, providing additional oxygen non&#8208;bonding (ONB) to stabilize the Ni&#8722;O bond and optimize the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby breaking the *OH and *OOH scaling relationship. The assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can stably operate for 250&#8197;hours at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 catalyst was constructed to tune the lattice oxygen redox during OER, with catalytic mechanism elucidated. Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) compared to NiCo2O4. Electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution within NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as also verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis. The 18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry provides direct evidence that the oxygen released during the OER originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4. We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly active spinel oxides for OER and offers significant insights into the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;enhanced LOM mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fucoidan Analogue and Its Inhibitory Activities against Heparanase and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purpose&#8208;designed low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fucoidan analogue exhibited anti&#8208;heparanase activity even in the cell&#8208;based assay. In addition, the analogue inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the analogue effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitous on cell surfaces and is used as a receptor by many viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, increased activity of the inflammatory enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which hydrolyses HS, in patients with COVID&#8208;19 not only increases the severity of symptoms but also may facilitate the spread of the virus by degrading HS on the cell surface. Therefore, synthetic HPSE blockades, which can bind to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and inhibit viral entry, have attracted much attention. This study investigated the development of a new dual&#8208;targeting antiviral agent against HPSE and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S using fucoidan as a structural motif. It was found that all&#8208;sulfated fucoidan derivative 10, which exhibited the highest binding affinity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S among 13 derivatives, also showed the highest inhibitory activity against HPSE. Based on this, a newly designed and synthesized fucoidan analogue 16, in which the octyl group of 10 was changed to a cholestanyl group, was found to show approximately 3 times higher activity than 10 but did not inhibit factor Xa associated with undesired anticoagulant effects. The binding affinity of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S was significantly increased approximately 400&#8208;fold over that of 10. The binding of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and ACE2. Furthermore, 16 effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.

         <title>Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin&#8208;Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise modification of tin&#8208;oxo clusters via the heterometal strategy, specifically varying the metal dopants and their coordination geometries, has resulted in SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2, thereby tuning their distinct lithography performance.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin&#8208;oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2 were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;quality films via spin&#8208;coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs Atomic Force Microscopy&#8208;based Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM&#8208;IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X&#8208;ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50&#8197;nm line patterns, with SnOC&#8208;1(In) demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8722;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility&#8208;switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) was introduced as an organic anode for proton batteries. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, fast and efficient Grotthuss proton conduction is enabled in the solid&#8208;state with low activation energy (192.7&#8197;meV). When coupling with tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCBQ) cathode, the all&#8208;organic proton battery achieves long stability over 3500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their applications are limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and lower the redox potentials of quinone materials. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7&#8197;meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperature.

TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all-organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub-zero temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; Radicals with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exotic P&#8208;bearing molecules, HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; are prepared as weakly bound complexes with CO in solid N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. The reaction kinetics for the spontaneous isomerization from HPN&#8901; to HNP&#8901; in the temperature range of 3&#8211;10&#8197;K reveals the dominant contribution by hydrogen atom tunneling.







Abstract
Phosphorus mononitride (PN) is a carrier of phosphorus in the interstellar medium. As the simplest derivatives of PN, the radical species HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; have remained elusive. Herein, we report the generation, characterization, and photochemistry of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; in N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. Specifically, HPN&#8901; was formed as a weakly bonded complex with CO in the matrix by 254&#8197;nm photolysis of the novel phosphinyl radical HPNCO&#8901;. The &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO complex is extremely unstable, as it undergoes spontaneous isomerization to the lower&#8208;energy isomer &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO through fast quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) with a half&#8208;life of 6.1&#8197;min at 3&#8197;K. Upon further irradiation at 254&#8197;nm, the reverse conversion of &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO to &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO along with dehydrogenation to yield PN was observed. The characterization &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO and &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO with matrix&#8208;isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D, 15N, and 13C isotope labeling and quantum chemical calculations at the XYGJ&#8208;OS/AVTZ level of theory, and the mechanism by hydrogen atom tunneling is consistent with multidimensional instanton theory calculations.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Driven Modular Precision Chemistry of Graphene Using &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for laser&#8208;induced precise 2D&#8208;functionalization of graphene using multifunctional trivalent iodine compounds is developed, allowing for complex and customized molecular engineering of the graphene surface. The tailor&#8208;made and reversible attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties enables programming the surface properties of graphene, paving the way for advanced nanoelectronics.







Abstract
The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning strategy utilizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks is proposed for the rational design of low&#8208;Pt high entropy intermetallic compounds (PtM3 type, where M=transition metal) for the oxygen reduction reaction. The developed Pt(FeCoNiCu)3/C catalyst, featuring small nanoparticle size, exhibits exceptional mass and specific activity, along with significantly enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011&#8197;eV atom&#8722;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (7.92&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish diffussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

         <title>In situ Monitoring of Photocatalysis on Polymeric Carbon Nitride Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes are developed for time&#8208;resolved monitoring of pCN photocatalyzed reaction processes under visible light conditions. This technique allows simultaneous in situ irradiation and monitoring of heterogeneous reactions, which enables the detection of intermediates that are elusive in conventional spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride has attracted significant interest in heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, we report on using carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes for in situ studies of photocatalytic reaction mechanisms. In a first step, we exploited carbon nitride&#8208;coated crimp vials as batch photoreactors for visible photocatalytic fluorinations of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, with moderate to excellent yields and reusability over multiple cycles. Eventually, carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes were used as a photoreactor by coupling them with optical fiber irradiation directly inside the spectrometer. This enabled us to follow the reaction with in situ NMR spectroscopy identifying reactive intermediates otherwise elusive in conventional analyses. The method provides advantages for the study of photocatalytic mechanisms of complex reactions and substantially reduces the need of comparative tests for depicting reaction intermediates and conversion pathways.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Dehydrogenative Aromatization of n&#8208;Hexyl to Phenyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8208;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on-surface thermal aromatization of n-hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl-substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n-hexyl-substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB-Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI-Hex), onto a pre-heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n-hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C-C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl-substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC-Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI-Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond-resolved non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n-hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160 min&#8208;1 to 0.00133 min&#8208;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis suggests that the split force transmission within the ring may suppress the sequential bond rupture mechanism in AM mechanophores under applied forces. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Thermodynamic Self&#8208;Regulation Dynamic Adsorption Mechanism for Ammonia Synthesis through Selective Orbital Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the continuous pursuing on the improvement of catalytic activity, a catalyst performed exceeding catalytic volcano plots is desired, while it is impeded by the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relations of reaction intermediates. Numerous efforts have been focused on optimizing the initial and final intermediates to circumvent the scaling relations for an improved performance. For a step forward, simultaneously optimizing all intermediates is essential to explore the theoretical maximum of catalytic activity. Herein, we proposed a dynamic adsorption mechanism (DAM) to independently regulate the adsorption configurations of all intermediates of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To demonstrate the DAM, a multi&#8208;site NbNi3 intermetallic is developed, which enables suitable adsorption energies of different intermediates via modulating orbital coupling mechanisms. As a result, NbNi3 achieves an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of NRR of &#8722;0.11 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Strikingly, the theoretical result is confirmed by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, wherein the nanoporous NbNi3 electrode exhibits a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 25.89 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the Faradic efficiency of 33.15% at &#8722;0.25 V vs. RHE. Overall, this work brings out a new strategy to avoid the scaling relations, and opens up a promising avenue toward high&#8208;efficiency NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules through Top Interface Modification with N&#8208;type Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface modification between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in achieving high performance inverted perovskite photovoltaics (i&#8208;PPVs). Herein, non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), known as Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO, were utilized to modify the perovskite/ETL interface in i&#8208;PPVs. Non&#8208;polar solvent&#8208;soluble NFAs can effectively passivate surface defects without structural damage of the underlying perovskite films. Additionally, the improved PCBM ETL induced by NFAs modification significantly accelerates the electrons extraction. As a result, both Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO exhibit more effective interface modification effects compared to traditional PI molecules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted perovskite solar cell (i&#8208;PSC) modified with Y7&#8208;BO reaches 25.82%. Moreover, the adoption of non&#8208;polar solvents and the superior semiconductor properties of Y7&#8208;BO molecules also enable perovskite solar modules (i&#8208;PSM) with effective areas of 50 cm2, 400 cm2, and 1160 cm2 to achieve record efficiencies of 23.05%, 22.32%, and 21.1% (certified PCE), respectively, making them the best PCE reported in the literature. Importantly, enhanced interface mechanical strength between the perovskite and PCBM layer results in significantly improved environmental and operational stability of the cells. The cells modified with Y7&#8208;BO maintained 94.4% of the initial efficiency after 1522 hours of maximum power point aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycopolymer&#8208;Mediated Selective Separation of Middle Rare Earth Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs), particularly middle REEs (MREEs) with intermediate ionic radii, poses significant challenges for current methods. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages negatively charged glycopolymers for size&#8208;specific separation of MREEs. By varying glycopolymer properties such as degree of polymerization (DP) and charge density, we achieved a distinct U&#8208;shaped selectivity profile, with a pronounced preference for Samarium (Sm) and Europium (Eu) over other REEs like Cerium (Ce), Gadolinium (Gd), and Holmium (Ho). Enrichment experiments demonstrated the practical potential of this methodology, achieving over 10% selectivity for Sm in Ce/Sm and Ho/Sm mixtures (10:1 ratios). Further, a separation experiment with a 1:1 Ce/Sm mixture yielded 15% enrichment after five filtration cycles with minimal glycopolymer, underscoring the approach's effectiveness. This work highlights the promise of glycopolymer&#8208;based strategies for targeted MREE separation, offering an efficient and tunable pathway for refining separation processes in REE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Selective Zeolites for Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation&#8208;Carbonylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8208;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities.

Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite-based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small-pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one-pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in-depth for Rh-catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biofuel&#8208;Driven Stepping Chiral Supramolecular Transfer Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a biofuel&#8208;driven recyclable chiral supramolecular transfer container based on hexacationic triphenylamine cage and nucleotides. Possessing rotatable paddle rigid backbones, the artificial receptor effectively encapsulated nucleotides with a high binding constant up to 5.37&#215;105 M&#8208;1 in water, displaying guest&#8208;induced efficient fluorescence enhancement with quantum yield increased from 6.5% to 16.6%. Especially, the achiral cage could effectively bind with adenosine triphosphate to activate chirality transfer from substrates to the single molecular container, giving circularly polarized luminescence at 575 nm and positive Cotton effect peaks with significant asymmetric factor (gabs = +6.4&#215;10&#8208;4). Meanwhile, the adaptive chiral supramolecule not only has reversible thermal responsiveness but also could stepwise regulate chirality transfer by the catalysis of hexokinase and apyrase in tandem, showing recovery adaptive chirality after refueled, achieving dynamically regulated programmable multistate chiral luminescent supramolecules. Therefore, the biofuel&#8208;driven chiral supramolecular transfer container could be successfully applied in chiral logic gates and multilevel information encryption, providing new insight into intelligent chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Baddeley Reaction: Access to Functionalized Decalins by Charge&#8208;Promoted Alkane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization of purely aliphatic substrates is a challenging endeavor, as the absence of directing groups generally thwarts attempts at regiocontrol. This is particularly true for difunctionalization reactions, where the control of relative stereochemistry poses an additional obstacle. The Baddeley reaction of decalins, despite suffering from strong limitations with regard to yield and generality, stands as one of only few known transformations capable of regio&#8208; and stereocontrol in aliphatic C&#8211;H functionalization. Herein, we report a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective method for the double functionalization of decalins enabling access to a novel, unreported regioisomer in synthetically useful yields. This method was also successfully applied to a range of other alkane substrates, enabling a straightforward synthesis of keto alcohols from the simplest alkane building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EV)s hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we reveal a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n = 63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by an Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km = 59.31 mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebuilding Peripheral F, Cl, Br Footprints on Acceptors Enables Binary Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency Exceeding 19.7%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given homomorphic fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and location on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH&#8208;F, CH&#8208;C and CH&#8208;B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re&#8208;permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH&#8208;B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH&#8208;B blend.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Given homomorphic fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and location on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH-F, CH-C and CH-B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re-permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH-B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH-B blend. Further benefitting from the large dielectric constant, small exciton binding energy, optimized molecular packing and great electron transfer integral, CH-B affords the first class binary OSC efficiency of 19.78%, moreover, the highest efficiency of 18.35% thus far when increasing active layer thickness to ~300 nm. Our successful screening in rebuilding peripheral halogen footprints provides the valuable insight into further rational design of SMAs for record-breaking OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combination of Ambient and High&#8208;Temperature Beryllium Nitride Motifs in W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds of transition metals and beryllium have a wide range of applications, from everyday tools to high tech applications. Remarkably, no single ternary beryllium nitride with a transition metal is known. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates, namely W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9. Both compounds were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from Be3N2 and W, using azide generated N2 as an oxidizing agent. The crystal structures, consisting of alternating layers of WN6 trigonal prisms and BeN4 tetrahedra, were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). The separating nitridoberyllate layers show either ambient temperature (&#945;&#8208;Be3N2 type) or high temperature (&#946;&#8208;Be3N2 type) motifs. W2Be4N5 was further corroborated by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV&#8208;VIS spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements. The latter revealed a mixed valence with an intermediate oxidation state of 3.5 for the W atoms. Both, the synthesis of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates and the synthesis approach using elemental W pave the way to a new field of nitride chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Myxoquaterines represent a recently discovered class of natural products with intriguing biological properties. They were isolated from Pendulasporacea albinea MSr 11954 and display a unique structure combining heterocyclic (pyrrole, oxazoline), hexa&#173;ene, and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol subunits. We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine&#8208;450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l&#8208;serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential. Especially the separation of cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons from their aromatic counterparts remains a significant challenge due to azeotrope formation and similar physical properties, often requiring energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we introduce a novel class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure to optimise &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions within the pore, enabling the highly selective molecular sieving of aromatic compounds from mixtures. Utilising dynamic covalent imine chemistry, the squareimine NDI2F42&#8208;based crystalline functional material is directly obtained from the reaction mixture in a single self&#8208;assembly step in high yields of 84%, alongside the larger NDI2F82 congener, which can be obtained in 69% yield. In vapour sorption and diffusion experiments, NDI2F42 demonstrates rapid adsorption kinetics with selectivities of 97:3 for benzene over cyclohexane and 93:7 for toluene over methylcyclohexane, while single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirm that the selectivity is primarily governed by directed &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Graphene/MoS2 Heterointerfaces by Perpendicular Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface chemistry and interface interactions profoundly influence the properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. Therefore, developing methods to precisely control surfaces and interfaces is crucial for harnessing the properties and functions of 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, we developed a facile approach to tuning the interface distance and properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (G/MoS2) by varying the functional groups attached to the surface of graphene bottom layer. We systematically investigated how different functionalized graphene bottom layers affect the interlayer distance, coupling between the interlayers, and optical properties of resulting G/MoS2 heterostructures. Our findings indicate that both the size and electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating properties of functional groups are pivotal in regulating charge transport properties, with size playing a particularly decisive role. Our approach demonstrates an efficient and flexible pathway to regulate the interlayer spacing and charge transport, highlighting the potential of engineering interface chemistry in optimizing properties of van der Waals heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2 days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. This work introduces a new design strategy for stable high&#8208;spin hydrocarbons, paving the way for future developments in high&#8208;spin organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Acidity/H2O2&#160;Dual&#8208;Cascade&#8208;Activatable Molecular Imaging Platform toward Metastatic Breast Tumor Malignancy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) is crucial for accurate tumor diagnosis, offering superior resolution and penetration capabilities. Current NIR&#8208;II probes are limited by either being "always on" or responding to one stimulus, leading to low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and potential false positives. We introduced a dual&#8208;lock&#8208;controlled probe, HN&#8208;PBA, activated by both H2O2 and tumor acidic environment. This dual response ensures bright fluorescence at tumor sites, leading to higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue ratios (T/NT) compared to conventional &#8220;always on&#8221; probes and probes activated only by H2O2. This strategy allows precise tumor identification and removal of primary and metastatic tumors, achieving superior T/NT ratios (24.3/6.4 for orthotopic and lung metastasis, respectively). Our probe also effectively detected lung metastatic foci as small as &#8804; 0.7 mm and showed the capability for accurate lesion localization in clinical breast cancer specimens. This dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy could aid future diagnostic probe design.</dc:description>

         <title>A De Novo Auto&#8208;Activated Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrid System for Hydrogen Production in Methanotrophic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Climate change driving by greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum&#8208;based energy has garnered significant attention. Renewable energy production via a sustainable system that integrates the cell factory and visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysts offers a novel approach for upcycling methane and addressing global energy challenges. Here, an auto&#8208;activated biohybrid system driven by solar energy is developed for converting methane into hydrogen fuel, which incorporated thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+) and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria. In this system, S&#8208;MV2+ functioned as photosensitizer and electron mediator, capturing solar energy and supplying electrons for an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed bioprocess. The genetically modified Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 mutant, lacking methanol dehydrogenase but overexpressing hydrogenase, is able to convert methane into methanol that maintains the electron flow cycle by quenching photogenerated holes for both hydrogen biosynthesis and methane oxidation. Finally, the highest H2 production of 272.96 &#181;M from this biohybrid system was achieved with methanol as a sacrificial agent generated by the H2&#8208;producing mutant, resulting in a 140&#8208;fold enhancement. This innovative method showcases the potential of coupling photocatalysis with methanotrophic biocatalysis for sustainable energy production. Additionally, the system introduces a new strategy for self&#8208;regeneration of sacrificial agents, offering a promising avenue for hydrogen production using greenhouse gases in an eco&#8208;friendly manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Confined Synthesis of BiVO4 Nanocluster for Urea Production with Remarkable O2/N2 Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8208; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8208; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8208; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8208; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2&#8208;framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#160;Spin&#8208;State Modulation of Catalytic Centers by Weak Ligand Field for Promoting Sulfur Redox Reaction in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spin state of transition&#8208;metal compounds in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) significantly impacts the electronic properties and the kinetics of sulfur redox reactions (SRR). However, accurately designing the spin state remains challenging, which is crucial for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship and developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, the CoF2, specifically the Co2+ with 3d7 electrons in a high&#8208;spin state distribution (t2g5eg2), were tailored predictably for the first time through the weak coordination field effect of the F element. Both DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the spin state of Co2+ transitions from low&#8208; to high&#8208;spin configurations and strongly interacts with sulfur species through Co&#8208;S and Li&#8208;F bonds during the SRR process. This interaction weakens the S&#8208;S bond, promoting its facile cleavage from both ends while also facilitating the rapid and uniform nucleation of Li2S2/Li2S, thus resulting in LSBs with a capacity of 447.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 C rates and stable cycling for 1000 cycles, with an acceptable practical capacity of 585 mAh g&#8208;1 at a high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm&#8208;2. This work achieves rational control of the active Co2+ d electron state through the field effect and enriches the application of spin control to accelerate SRR in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reducing Dead Species by Electrochemically&#8208;Densified Cathode&#8208;Interface&#8208;Reaction Layer towards High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Endurable Zn||I&#8208;Br Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interhalogen&#8208;involved aqueous Zn||halogen batteries (AZHBs) are latent high&#8208;energy systems for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet usually suffer from poor high&#8208;rate endurability caused by the formation of &#8220;dead species&#8221;. Herein, via an electrochemically&#8208;densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL), Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries involving interhalogen reactions between the I2 cathode and Br&#8208; from the electrolytes are initially achieved with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability. Different from that in diluted electrolytes, the CIRL formed in Br&#8208;&#8208;concentrated electrolyte is denser and water&#8208;lean, which enables halogen species conversion with a more rapid charge transfer and lower activation energy. More importantly, the CIRL robustly affords a decent I2 conservation by accelerated conversion kinetics and limited species diffusion, thereby endowing the Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries with an ultralong high&#8208;rate lifespan. The electrochemical mechanism is sufficiently verified by multiple spectral characterizations. Consequently, Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries in Br&#8208;&#8208;concentrated (20 m) electrolytes exhibit an overwhelming rate capability and lifespan to those in Br&#8208;&#8208;diluted (2 m) electrolytes. Typically, when cycled at a large current density of 10 A g&#8208;1, an ultralong lifespan of over 25,000 cycles is achieved with a high retention of 98.3%. This study provides new insight into the CIRL&#8208;dictated active species conservation for high&#8208;rate endurable AZHBs, which could apply to other high&#8208;energy interhalogen batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, LiNO3 significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, and its protective effect on lithium metal is limited, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Reactivity of Nitrones with Amino Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled modifications of amino acids are an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental and translational research based on peptides and proteins. Yet, we still lack methods to chemically modify each naturally occurring amino acid sidechain. To help address this gap, we show that N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines expand the scope of bioconjugation methods to chemically modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues with evidence for additional tyrosine labelling in a proteomic context. Conjugation primarily at tryptophan sites can be accessed by selective cleavage of modifications at other sidechains. The N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridine reagents are accessed through photoisomerization of nitrones, which serve as photocaged reagents, thus providing an additional level of control over reactivity. Initial guiding principles for the design of nitrone reagents are developed by exploring the impact of structure on UV&#8208;vis absorption, photoisomerization, and reactivity. We identify a nitrone structure that maximizes photoisomerization efficiency, the aqueous stability of the oxaziridine, the extent of amino acid modification, and the stability of the resulting amino acid conjugates. We then translate nitrone reagents to modify proteins in aqueous conditions. Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage</dc:description>

         <title>Location&#8208;Specific Microenvironment Modulation Around Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite coordination environment of catalytic metal sites has been recognized to be of great importance in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), a significant challenge remains in the understanding how the location&#8208;specific microenvironment in the higher coordination sphere influences their catalysis. Herein, a series of Cu&#8208;based SACs, namely Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2), are successfully constructed by anchoring single Cu atoms onto the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X. The &#8208;X functional groups dangling on the MOF linkers could be regarded as location&#8208;specific remote microenvironment to regulate electronic properties of the single Cu atoms. Remarkably, they exhibit significant differences in the catalysis toward the hydroboration of alkynes. The activity follows the order of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 &#707; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66 &#707; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under identical reaction conditions, where Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 showcases the phenylacetylene conversion of 92%, ~3.5 times higher efficiency than that of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Experimental and calculation results jointly support that the Cu electronic structure is modulated by the location&#8208;specific microenvironment, thereby regulating the product desorption and promoting the catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement effects and manipulation strategies of nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials featuring well&#8208;defined nanoscale channels have demonstrated inherent advantages in the selective transport of gases, liquids, and ions, making them pivotal in applications such as molecular separation, catalysis and energy storage. A crucial challenge lies in the assembly of ordered nanochannel structures and the transformation of such microscopic ordered structures into macroscopic regular distributions to achieve performance improvements. Nanocomposites provide a promising solution by incorporating nanoscale material (e.g., filler) that significantly enhance macroscale properties of matrix (e.g., polymer). In this review, we spotlight nanocomposite membranes that leverage the confinement effects between filler and matrix to construct precise nanochannels and regulate the nanochannel distribution. We discussed the underlying design principles, channel architectures, and the manipulation strategies for integrating filler and polymers into functional membranes. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental mechanisms of mass transport, and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships within the nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation. This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these nanocomposite membranes can be further developed to meet the demands of industrial and environmental applications.</dc:description>
