         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co Metallic Heterostructure as a Highly Active Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the novel metallic heterostructure Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co was prepared and exhibited excellent water splitting performance. This metallic heterostructure enhances the electron transport efficiency and accelerates the reaction rate of water molecules on its surface by optimizing the electronic structure of the heterointerface.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis holds promise for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, yet it encounters challenges like high voltage and limited stability at higher current densities, primarily due to inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;based metallic heterostructure (Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co) is designed for excellent water electrolysis. In operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, increasing the available protons for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface optimizes &#916;GH of the nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby enhancing the overall HER performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH&#8722; adsorption rate, coupled with great adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction accelerates electron transport, expediting the afore&#8208;mentioned reaction steps and enhancing water splitting efficiency. The Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance, with a low 1.58&#8197;V cell voltage at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and maintains 100&#8201;% retention over 100&#8197;hours at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Promoted Cycloadditions in Lipid Bilayers Triggered by Liposome Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon membrane fusion and lipid mixing, the embedded functional dyes undergo cycloaddition to form the covalently bound product, resulting in the emission of FRET signal, which remains even after liposome destruction.







Abstract
Due to the variety of roles served by the cell membrane, its composition and structure are complex, making it difficult to study. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as the strain promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), are powerful tools for exploring the function of biomolecules in their native environment but have been largely unexplored within the context of lipid bilayers. Here, we developed a new approach to study the SPAAC reaction in liposomal membranes using azide&#8208; and strained alkyne&#8208;functionalized F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dye pairs. This study represents the first characterization of the SPAAC reaction between diffusing molecules inside liposomal membranes. Potential applications of this work include in situ bioorthogonal labeling of membrane proteins, improved understanding of membrane dynamics and fluidity, and the generation of new probes for biosensing assays.

         <title>Intermediate Color Emission via Nanographenes with Organic Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanographenes (NGs) produced by top&#8208;down methods carry multiple functional groups. We utilized this aspect for the reproduction of purple light by adding red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light emitting fluorophores. Based on our results, NGs can be utilized as carriers of fluorophores capable of generating intermediate colors of light.







Abstract
Photoluminescence (PL) color can be tuned by mixing fluorophores emitting the three primary colors in an appropriate ratio. When color tuning is achieved on a single substrate, we can simplify device structures. We demonstrated that nanographenes (NGs), which are graphene fragments with a size of tens of nanometers, could be utilized as carriers of fluorophores. The addition of red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting fluorophores on the edge successfully reproduced the purple light. The relative PL intensities of the fluorophores could be regulated by the excitation wavelength, enabling multicolor emission between blue and red light. Owing to the triphenylamine units of the fluorophores, the NGs showed PL enhancement due to aggregation. This characteristic was valuable for the fabrication of solid polymer materials. Specifically, the functionalized NGs can be dispersed into polyvinylidene difluoride. The resultant polymer films emitted red, blue, and purple color. Our study demonstrated the potential applicability of NGs for fluorophore carriers capable of reproducing intermediate colors of light.

         <title>Supramolecular Genome Editing: Targeted Delivery and Endogenous Activation of CRISPR/Cas9 by Dynamic Host&#8208;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a kind of supramolecular cationic polymer bearing cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) for the delivery of the plasmid encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9) and single&#8208;guide RNA. The dynamic host&#8208;guest complexation between CB[7] moieties and trimethoprim, a stabilizer for dsCas9, can be competitively decomplexed by elevated polyamines in the tumor cells to activate Cas9&#8208;based genome editing in vivo, thereby ensuring the highly specific therapeutic genome editing for cancer gene therapy.







Abstract
We synthesize supramolecular poly(disulfide) (CPS) containing covalently attached cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), which is exploited not only as a carrier to deliver plasmid DNA encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9), but also as a host to include trimethoprim (TMP) by CB[7] moieties through the supramolecular complexation to form TMP@CPS/dsCas9. Once the plasmid is transfected into tumor cells by CPS, the presence of polyamines can competitively trigger the decomplexation of TMP@CPS, thereby displacing and releasing TMP from CB[7] to stabilize dsCas9 that can target and edit the genomic locus of PLK1 to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Following the systemic administration of TMP@CPS/dsCas9 decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA), tumor&#8208;specific editing of PLK1 is detected due to the elevated polyamines in tumor microenvironment, greatly minimizing off&#8208;target editing in healthy tissues and non&#8208;targeted organs. As the metabolism of polyamines is dysregulated in a wide range of disorders, this study offers a supramolecular approach to precisely control CRISPR/Cas9 functions under particular pathological contexts.

The small&#8208;molecule brachyury downmodulator DHC&#8208;156 was developed through the optimization of afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved inhibitor. A series of structure&#8211;activity relationships, guided by biochemical assays and crystallography, lead to the discovery of DHC&#8208;156, which was shown to spare all wild&#8208;type kinases and downmodulates brachyury in a post&#8208;translational manner.







Abstract
Brachyury is an oncogenic transcription factor whose overexpression drives chordoma growth. The downmodulation of brachyury in chordoma cells has demonstrated therapeutic potential, however, as a transcription factor it is classically deemed &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. Given that direct pharmacological intervention against brachyury has proven difficult, attempts at intervention have instead targeted upstream kinases. Recently, afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved kinase inhibitor, has been shown to modulate brachyury levels in multiple chordoma cell lines. Herein, we use afatinib as a lead to undertake a structure&#8208;based drug design approach, aided by mass&#8208;spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography, to develop DHC&#8208;156, a small molecule that more selectively binds brachyury and downmodulates it as potently as afatinib. We eliminated kinase&#8208;inhibition from this novel scaffold while demonstrating that DHC&#8208;156 induces the post&#8208;translational downmodulation of brachyury that results in an irreversible impairment of chordoma tumor cell growth. In doing so, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct brachyury modulation, which may further be developed into more potent tool compounds and therapies.

         <title>Multifunctional Trifluoroborate Additive for Simultaneous Carrier Dynamics Governance and Defects Passivation to Boost Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>

PTFBK has been employed as a multifunctional additive to target and modulate bulk perovskite defects and carrier dynamics of PSCs, endowing the decrease of Young&#8242;s modulus and residual stress in the perovskite layer. Moreover, benefit to the dominant crystal orientation and the suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination, excellent stable inverted device with PCE of 24.99% was achieved.







Abstract
The main obstacles to promoting the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) include their record power conversion efficiency (PCE), which still remains below the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit, and poor long&#8208;term stability, attributable to crystallographic defects in perovskite films and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss in devices. In this study, potassium (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylpiperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) methyl trifluoroborate (PTFBK) was employed as a multifunctional additive to target and modulate bulk perovskite defects and carrier dynamics of PSCs. Apart from simultaneously passivating anionic and cationic defects, PTFBK could also optimize the energy&#8208;level alignment of devices and weaken the interaction between carriers and longitudinal optical phonons, resulting in a carrier lifetime of greater than 3&#8197;&#956;s. Furthermore, it inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved the crystallization capacity in the target perovskite film. Hence, the target rigid and flexible p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs yielded champion PCEs of 24.99&#8201;% and 23.48&#8201;%, respectively. More importantly, due to hydrogen bonding between formamidinium and fluorine, the target devices exhibited remarkable thermal, humidity, and operational tracking at maximum power point stabilities. The reduced Young's modulus and residual stress in the perovskite layer also provided excellent bending stability for flexible target devices.

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia: State of the Catalyst During Reaction and Deactivation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ammonia over a Cs&#8208;promoted Fe catalyst via the novel approach of mechanocatalysis is carefully studied by ex situ characterizations of the catalyst. Physicochemical changes are related to the different stages of ammonia formation. Optimizations based on these results resulted in the intrinsically complicated low&#8208;temperature ammonia synthesis being one of the longest stable mechanocatalytic gas&#8208;phase reactions to date.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis holds significant importance for both agricultural fertilizer production and emerging green energy applications. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of a catalyst for mechanochemical ammonia synthesis, based on Cs&#8208;promoted Fe. The study sheds light on the catalyst&#8216;s dynamic evolution under reaction conditions and the origin of deactivation. Initially, elemental Cs converts to CsH, followed by partial CsOH formation due to trace oxygen impurities on the surface of the Fe metal and the equipment. Concurrently, the mechanical milling process comminutes Fe, exposing fresh metallic Fe surfaces. This comminution correlates with an induction period observed during ammonia formation. Critical to the study, degradation of active Cs promoter species (CsH and CsNH2) into inactive CsOH emerged as the primary deactivation mechanism. By increasing the Cs content from 2.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% to 4.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%, we achieved stable, continuous ammonia synthesis for nearly 90&#8197;hours, showcasing one of the longest&#8208;running mechanocatalytic gas phase reactions. Studies of the temperature dependence of the reaction revealed negligible bulk temperature influence in the range of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to 100&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the dominance of mechanical action over bulk thermal effects. This study offers insights into the complex interplay between mechanical processing, reactive species, and deactivation mechanisms in mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

A new porphyrin conjugated polymer cathode, COP500&#8208;CuT2TP is achieved under electrochemical polymerization. Self&#8208;exfoliation of polymer cathode promotes charge storage, leading to a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 900&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved. Mechanistic insights by combining experimental and computational investigations supports the charge storage performance.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage materials due to their environmental friendliness and sustainable renewability. However, problems such as their high solubility in electrolytes and low intrinsic conductivity have always plagued their further application. Polymerization to form conjugated organic polymers can not only inhibit the dissolution of organic electrodes in the electrolyte, but also enhance the intrinsic conductivity of organic molecules. Herein, we synthesized a new conjugated organic polymer (COPs) COP500&#8208;CuT2TP (poly [5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl) porphyrinato] copper (II)) by electrochemical polymerization method. Due to the self&#8208;exfoliation behavior, the porphyrin cathode exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high specific energy of 900&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1 with a first coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000&#8197;cycles without capacity loss was achieved even at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This highly conjugated structure promotes COP500&#8208;CuT2TP combined high energy density, high power density, and good cycling stability, which would open new opportunity for the designable and versatile organic electrodes for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Descriptor&#8208;Based Volcano Relations Predict Single Atoms for Hydroxylamine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior hydroxylamine (NH2OH) selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proven to enhance NH2OH formation.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an important feedstock in fuels, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Nanostructured electrocatalysts drive green electrosynthesis of hydroxylamine from nitrogen oxide species in water. However, current electrocatalysts still suffer from low selectivity and manpower&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error modes, leaving unclear selectivity/activity origins and a lack of catalyst design principles. Herein, we theoretically analyze key determinants of selectivity/activity and propose the adsorption energy of NHO (Gad(*NHO)) as a performance descriptor. A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior NH2OH selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict a series of SACs and discover Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. These theoretical prediction results are also confirmed by experimental results, rationalizing our Gad(*NHO) descriptor. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proved to enhance NH2OH formation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroxylamine (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) is an important feedstock in fuels, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Nanostructured electrocatalysts drive green electrosynthesis of hydroxylamine from nitrogen oxide species in water. However, current electrocatalysts still suffer from low selectivity and manpower-consuming trial-and-error modes, leaving unclear selectivity/activity origins and a lack of catalyst design principles. Herein, we theoretically analyze key determinants of selectivity/activity and propose the adsorption energy of NHO (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>SN2 Reaction at the Amide Nitrogen Center Enables Hydrazide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N&#8722;N coupling approach to the practical synthesis of hydrazides is disclosed by employing an SN2 strategy at electrophilic amides with nucleophilic amines. The reaction exhibits mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, easy scalability, and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions are fundamentally important transformations in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite the substantial advances in bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions (SN2) at saturated carbon centers, analogous SN2 reaction at the amide nitrogen atom remains extremely limited. Here we report an SN2 substitution method at the amide nitrogen atom with amine nucleophiles for nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond formation that leads to a novel strategy toward biologically and medicinally important hydrazide derivatives. We found the use of sulfonate&#8208;leaving groups at the amide nitrogen atom played a pivotal role in the reaction. This new N&#8722;N coupling reaction allows the use of O&#8208;tosyl hydroxamates as electrophiles and readily available amines, including acyclic aliphatic amines and saturated N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples), excellent functional group tolerability, and scalability. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold synthesis.

         <title>Ultrafast Biomimetic Oxidative Folding of Cysteine&#8208;rich Peptides and Microproteins in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, we established a method that replicates a hydrophobic environment akin to that of the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to effective suppression in dead&#8208;end products and acceleration of reaction rates through high thiolate concentrations for the oxidative folding of cysteine&#8208;rich peptides and microproteins.







Abstract
Disulfides in peptides and proteins are essential for maintaining a properly folded structure. Their oxidative folding is invariably performed in an aqueous&#8208;buffered solution. However, this process is often slow and can lead to misfolded products. Here, we report a novel concept and strategy that is bio&#8208;inspired to mimic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) by accelerating disulfide exchange rates many thousand&#8208;fold. The proposed strategy termed organic oxidative folding is performed under organic solvents to yield correctly folded cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins instantaneously without observable misfolded or dead&#8208;end products. Compared to conventional aqueous oxidative folding strategies, enormously large rate accelerations up to 113,200&#8208;fold were observed. The feasibility and generality of the organic oxidative folding strategy was successfully demonstrated on 15 cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins of different hydrophobicity, lengths (14 to 58 residues), and numbers of disulfides (2 to 5 disulfides), producing the native products in a second and in high yield.

         <title>Selective Intracellular Delivery of Antibodies in Cancer Cells with Nanocarriers Sensing Endo/Lysosomal Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo/lysosomal cathepsin B activity differentiates among cell types and serves as a stimulus to trigger cell&#8208;specific endosomal escape. By designing nanocarriers armed with cathepsin B&#8208;activatable endosomal escape function, endosomal escape can be controlled to only occur in targeted cancer cells with upregulated endo/lysosomal cathepsin B activity. This innovative approach offers a new means to achieve targeted intracellular protein delivery.







Abstract
The differential enzymatic activity in the endo/lysosomes of particular cells could trigger targeted endosomal escape functions, enabling selective intracellular protein delivery. However, this strategy may be jeopardized due to protein degradation during endosomal trafficking. Herein, using custom made fluorescent probes to assess the endosomal activity of cathepsin B (CTSB) and protein degradation, we found that certain cancer cells with hyperacidified endosomes grant a spatiotemporal window where CTSB activity surpass protein digestion. This inspired the engineering of antibody&#8208;loaded polymeric nanocarriers having CTSB&#8208;activatable endosomal escape ability. The nanocarriers selectively escaped from the endo/lysosomes in the cells with high endosomal CTSB activity and delivered active antibodies to intracellular targets. This study provides a viable strategy for cell&#8208;specific protein delivery using stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers with controlled endosomal escape.

         <title>Graphitic Armor: A Natural Molecular Sieve for Robust Hydrogen Electroxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, graphite armor serves as a natural molecule sieve screening out bulky adversative molecules like O2 or CO but allowing H2 to diffuse along both the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane direction. This creates perfect chance for fabricating robust HOR electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon coating layers have been found to improve the catalytic performance of transition metals, which is usually explained as an outcome of electronic synergistic effect. Herein we reveal that the defective graphitic carbon, with a unique interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, can be a highly selective natural molecular sieve. It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in&#8208;plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342&#8197;nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen&#8208;relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO&#8208;relevant poisoning.

The flexible Zn&#8208;ion electrochromic battery (ZIEB) with multiple color conversion, satisfactory capacity and superior cycle stability was assembled for real&#8208;time energy monitoring through visual color conversion.







Abstract
Electrochromic batteries as emerging smart energy devices are highly sought after owing to their real&#8208;time energy monitoring through visual color conversion. However, their large&#8208;scale applicability is hindered by insufficient capacity, inadequate cycling stability, and limited color variation. Herein, a flexible Zn&#8208;ion electrochromic battery (ZIEB) was assembled with sodium vanadate (VONa+) cathode, ion&#8208;redistributing hydrogel electrolyte, and Zn anode to address these challenges. The electrolyte contains anchored &#8722;SO3&#8722; and &#8208;NH3+, which facilitates ionic transportation and prevents Zn dendrite formation by promoting orientated Zn2+ deposition on the Zn (002) surface. The ZIEB exhibits a continuous reversible color transition, ranging from fully charged orange to mid&#8208;charged brown and drained green. It also demonstrates a high specific capacity of 302.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 96.3&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, the ZIEB maintains stable energy output even under bending, rolling, knotting, and twisting. This work paves a new strategy for the design of smart energy devices in wearable electronics.

         <title>Creating 3D Nanoparticle Structural Space via Data Augmentation to Bidirectionally Predict Nanoparticle Mixture's Purity, Size, and Shape from Extinction Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>

Leveraging plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment and machine learning&#8208;directed data augmentation to create a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoparticle structural space for bidirectional predictions of silver nanocube's purity, size, and shape (corner radius) in as&#8208;synthesized nanoparticle mixtures using extinction spectra and vice versa.







Abstract
Nanoparticle (NP) characterization is essential because diverse shapes, sizes, and morphologies inevitably occur in as&#8208;synthesized NP mixtures, profoundly impacting their properties and applications. Currently, the only technique to concurrently determine these structural parameters is electron microscopy, but it is time&#8208;intensive and tedious. Here, we create a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) NP structural space to concurrently determine the purity, size, and shape of 1000 sets of as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanocubes mixtures containing interfering nanospheres and nanowires from their extinction spectra, attaining low predictive errors at 2.7&#8211;7.9&#8201;%. We first use plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment to extract localized surface plasmon resonance attributes from spectra and establish a lasso regressor (LR) model to predict purity, size, and shape. Leveraging the learned LR, we artificially generate 425,592 augmented extinction spectra to overcome data scarcity and create a comprehensive NP structural space to bidirectionally predict extinction spectra from structural parameters with &lt;4&#8201;% error. Our interpretable NP structural space further elucidates the two higher&#8208;order combined electric dipole, quadrupole, and magnetic dipole as the critical structural parameter predictors. By incorporating other NP shapes and mixtures&#8242; extinction spectra, we anticipate our approach, especially the data augmentation, can create a fully generalizable NP structural space to drive on&#8208;demand, autonomous synthesis&#8208;characterization platforms.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Macrocyclization towards Crown Ethers Using Hydroamination of Bis(allenes)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines was found to be an efficient strategy to access chiral crown ethers starting from achiral substrates. This new strategy is characterized by high chemo&#8208;, enantio&#8208;and diastereoselectivity with a wide range of substrates and with good functional group tolerance to access a wide range of chiral macrocycles in high yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
Enantiomerically enriched crown ethers (CE) exhibit strong asymmetric induction in phase transfer catalysis, supramolecular catalysis and molecular recognition processes. Traditional methods have often been used to access these valuable compounds, which limit their diversity and consequently their applicability. Herein, a practical catalytic method is described for the gram scale synthesis of a class of chiral CEs (aza&#8208;crown ethers; ACEs) using Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines. Using this approach, a wide range of chiral vinyl functionalized CEs with ring sizes ranging from 12 to 36 have been successfully prepared in high yields of up to 92&#8201;%, dr of up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and er of up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1. These vinyl substituted CEs allow for further diversification giving facile access to various CE derivatives as well as to their three&#8208;dimensional analogues using ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Some of these chiral CEs themselves display high potential for use in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Binding of Precursors to Replicator Assemblies Can Improve Replication Fidelity and Mediate Error Correction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of precursor molecules to the side of a fibrous assembly of self&#8208;replicating macrocycles can improve the fidelity of replication and yield a novel error&#8208;correction mechanism, provided that the fibers bind selectively to precursors that match the building&#8208;block composition of the replicator.







Abstract
Copying information is vital for life&#8216;s propagation. Current life forms maintain a low error rate in replication, using complex machinery to prevent and correct errors. However, primitive life had to deal with higher error rates, limiting its ability to evolve. Discovering mechanisms to reduce errors would alleviate this constraint. Here, we introduce a new mechanism that decreases error rates and corrects errors in synthetic self&#8208;replicating systems driven by self&#8208;assembly. Previous work showed that macrocycle replication occurs through the accumulation of precursor material on the sides of the fibrous replicator assemblies. Stochastic simulations now reveal that selective precursor binding to the fiber surface enhances replication fidelity and error correction. Centrifugation experiments show that replicator fibers can exhibit the necessary selectivity in precursor binding. Our results suggest that synthetic replicator systems are more evolvable than previously thought, encouraging further evolution&#8208;focused experiments.

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Rhodium (III) Complexes in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photothermal Heterogeneous C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general post&#8208;synthetic strategy for constructing bifunctional catalysts, Rh&#8208;COF, which connect photosensitive covalent organic frameworks and transition&#8208;metal catalytic groups through covalent bonding, was developed. Fascinatingly, such complexes enable efficient photothermal conversion properties, which can improve the photothermal catalytic performances in C&#8722;H activation to obtain excellent yield, substrate suitability and recyclability.







Abstract
Although photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation has been realized by using heterogeneous catalysts, most of them require high&#8208;temperature conditions to provide the energy required for C&#8722;H bond breakage. The catalysts with photothermal conversion properties can catalyze this reaction efficiently at room temperature, but so far, these catalysts have been rarely developed. Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh&#8208;COF&#8208;316 and &#8208;318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition&#8208;metal catalytic moiety using a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The Rh&#8208;COF enable the heterogeneous C&#8722;H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) formation at room temperature. The excellent performances can be attributed to the COF&#8208;316, which enhances the photothermal effect (&#916;T=50.9&#8201;&#176;C), thus accelerating C&#8722;H bond activation and the exchange of catalyst with substrates.

Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh-COF-316 and -318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition-metal catalytic moiety using a post-synthetic approach. The Rh-COF enable the heterogeneous C&#8722;H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) formation at room temperature. The excellent performances can be attributed to the COF-316, which enhances the photothermal effect (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;=50.9&#8201;&#176;C), thus accelerating C&#8722;H bond activation and the exchange of catalyst with substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Activated Boron Nitride for Selective Photocatalytic Coupling of Methanol to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;activated boron nitride fibers (BNH) have been successfully synthesized and applied for the selective photocatalytic coupling of methanol to ethylene glycol (EG) reaction. The OB3 unit in the BNH plays an important role in the selective dehydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling of methanol molecules, leading to excellent activity and selectivity of BNH for EG production.







Abstract
The controllable photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling of methanol to produce ethylene glycol (EG) is a highly desirable but challenging objective for replacing the current energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalytic process. Here, we develop a metal&#8208;free porous boron nitride catalyst that demonstrates exceptional selectivity in the photocatalytic production of EG from methanol under mild conditions. Comprehensive experiments and calculations are conducted to thoroughly investigate the reaction mechanism, revealing that the OB3 unit in the porous BN plays a critical role in the preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form &#8901;CH2OH via a concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. More prominent energy barriers are observed for the further dehydrogenation of the &#8901;CH2OH intermediate on the OB3 unit, inhibiting the formation of some other by&#8208;products during the catalytic process. Additionally, a small downhill energy barrier for the coupling of &#8901;CH2OH in the OB3 unit promotes the selective generation of EG. This study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and can serve as a guide for the design and optimization of photocatalysts for efficient and selective EG production under mild conditions.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping and Structural Modulation of Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a foundational understanding of an electrochemical strategy for doping and structurally modulating electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Additionally, various applications of these MOFs have been developed based on their distinct electrochemical behaviors.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce an electrochemical doping strategy aimed at manipulating the structure and composition of electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs). Our methodology is exemplified through a representative c&#8208;MOF, Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP=2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene), synthesized into porous thin films supported by nanocellulose. While the c&#8208;MOF exhibits characteristic capacitive behavior in neutral electrolyte; it manifests redox behaviors in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Evidence indicates that the organic ligands within c&#8208;MOF undergo oxidation (p&#8208;doping) and reduction (n&#8208;doping) when exposed to specific electrochemical potentials in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Interestingly, the p&#8208;doping process proves reversible, with the c&#8208;MOF structure remaining stable across cyclic p&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping. In contrast, the n&#8208;doping is irreversible, leading to the gradual decomposition of the framework into inorganic species over a few cycles. Drawing on these findings, we showcase the versatile electrochemical applications of c&#8208;MOFs and their derived composites, encompassing electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, and ultrafast actuation. This study provides profound insights into the doping of c&#8208;MOFs, offering a new avenue for modulating their chemical and electronic structure, thereby broadening their potential for diverse electrochemical applications.

         <title>Thiophene &#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Multimodal Tumor Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, BT&#8208;NS in which benzo[c]thiophene serves as &#960;&#8208;bridge is constructed. An integration of experimental and theoretical studies disclosed BT&#8208;NS is advantageous for NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT/PTT treatment of tumors, displaying outstanding therapeutic efficacy and excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
The fabrication of a multimodal phototheranostic platform on the basis of single&#8208;component theranostic agent to afford both imaging and therapy simultaneously, is attractive yet full of challenges. The emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), particularly those emit fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), provides a powerful tool for cancer treatment by virtue of adjustable pathway for radiative/non&#8208;radiative energy consumption, deeper penetration depth and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance. Although bulky thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridges such as ortho&#8208;alkylated thiophene, 3,4&#8208;ethoxylene dioxythiophene and benzo[c]thiophene are commonly adopted to construct NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, the subtle differentiation on their theranostic behaviours has yet to be comprehensively investigated. In this work, systematical investigations discovered that AIEgen BT&#8208;NS bearing benzo[c]thiophene possesses acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission intensity, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Eventually, by using of BT&#8208;NS nanoparticles, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal elimination of tumors was demonstrated. This study thus offers useful insights into developing versatile phototheranostic systems for clinical trials.

         <title>Flavin&#8208;N5OOH Functions as both a Powerful Nucleophile and a Base in the Superfamily of Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational study demonstrates that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH species can function as both powerful nucleophiles and bases in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which can mediate many kinds of challenging non&#8208;redox reactions, such as the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, Cl) bonds. The findings revive oxygen activation chemistry by flavoenzymes and are expected to spur the discovery of many other Flavin&#8208;N5OOH&#8208;dependent enzymes.







Abstract
Flavoenzymes can mediate a large variety of oxidation reactions through the activation of oxygen. However, the O2 activation chemistry of flavin enzymes is not yet fully exploited. Normally, the O2 activation occurs at the C4a site of the flavin cofactor, yielding the flavin C4a&#8208;(hydro)hydroperoxyl species in monooxygenases or oxidases. Using extensive MD simulations, QM/MM calculations and QM calculations, our studies reveal the formation of the common nucleophilic species, Flavin&#8208;N5OOH, in two distinct flavoenzymes (RutA and EncM). Our studies show that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH acts as a powerful nucleophile that promotes C&#8722;N cleavage of uracil in RutA, and a powerful base in the deprotonation of substrates in EncM. We reason that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH can be a common reactive species in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which accomplish generally selective general base catalysis and C&#8722;X (X=N, S, Cl, O) cleavage reactions that are otherwise challenging with solvated hydroxide ion base. These results expand our understanding of the chemistry and catalysis of flavoenzymes.

         <title>Unveiling pH&#8208;Dependent Adsorption Strength of *CO2&#8722; Intermediate over High&#8208;Density Sn Single Atom Catalyst for Acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalyst is presented and ATR&#8208;FTIR is used to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722;, a key intermediate in acidic electrolyte on its surface. It is shown that the increase of electrolyte pH results in a redshift of the peak position of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate, i.e., the adsorption strength of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate increases, which in turn affects the performance of CO2RR to direct HCOOH in acidic electrolyte.







Abstract
The acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct formic acid (HCOOH) production holds promise in meeting the carbon&#8208;neutral target, yet its performance is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding the adsorption strength of the key intermediates in acidic electrolyte is indispensable to favor CO2RR over HER. In this work, high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared and used as catalyst, to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength and coverage of *CO2&#8722; intermediatethat enables enhanced acidic CO2RR towards direct HCOOH production. At pH=3, Sn SACs could deliver a high Faradaic efficiency (90.8&#8201;%) of HCOOH formation and a corresponding partial current density up to &#8722;178.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The detailed in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopic studies reveal that a favorable alkaline microenvironment for CO2RR to HCOOH is formed near the surface of Sn SACs, even in the acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722; intermediate is unravelled over the Sn SACs, which in turn affects the competition between HER and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Facilitates the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror&#8208;Image Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag was described for the chemical synthesis of mirror&#8208;image proteins. Solubilizing tags were easily installed on the side chain groups of DLys/DSer/DThr and the N&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;amino group of D&#8208;peptides via an L&#8208;Lys linker. Solubilizing tags were impervious to various commonly used reagents in D&#8208;protein synthesis. After protein assembly, multiple solubilizing tags can be removed under denaturing conditions.







Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins) are useful in biomedical research for purposes such as mirror&#8208;image screening for D&#8208;peptide drug discovery, but the chemical synthesis of many D&#8208;proteins is often low yielding due to the poor solubility or aggregation of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we report a Lys&#8208;C protease&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag and its use to synthesize difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain D&#8208;proteins. Our tag is easily installed onto multiple amino acids such as DLys, DSer, DThr, and/or the N&#8208;terminal amino acid of hydrophobic D&#8208;peptides, is impervious to various reaction conditions, such as peptide synthesis, ligation, desulfurization, and transition metal&#8208;mediated deprotection, and yet can be completely removed by Lys&#8208;C protease under denaturing conditions to give the desired D&#8208;protein. The efficacy and practicality of the new method were exemplified in the synthesis of two challenging D&#8208;proteins: D&#8208;enantiomers of programmed cell death protein 1 IgV domain and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein, in high yield. This work demonstrates that the enzymatic cleavage of solubilizing tags under denaturing conditions is feasible, thus paving the way for the production of more D&#8208;proteins.

         <title>Valence Tautomerism Induced Proton Coupled Electron Transfer:X&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with a Dinuclear Au(II) Hydroxide Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;Coupled electron transfer (PCET)&#8208;type reactivity of the dinuclear AuII hydroxide complex AuII2(L)2(OH)2 (L=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis (2,6&#8208;dimethyl) phenylformamidinate) towards weak X&#8722;H bonds is reported. For C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation Au&#8722;Au &#963;&#8208;bond polarization leads to an adjustment of oxidation levels for both Au centers prior to the PCET event. The oxidation event for C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is therefore described as a valence tautomerism induced PCET, where a basic reduced Au&#8722;OH unit serves as proton acceptor and the second more oxidized Au center as an electron acceptor.







Abstract
We report the preparation and characterization of the dinuclear AuII hydroxide complex AuII2(L)2(OH)2 (L=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis (2,6&#8208;dimethyl) phenylformamidinate) and study its reactivity towards weak X&#8722;H bonds. Through the interplay of kinetic analysis and computational studies, we demonstrate that the oxidation of cyclohexadiene follows a concerted proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (cPCET) mechanism, a rare type of reactivity for Au complexes. We find that the Au&#8722;Au &#963;&#8208;bond undergoes polarization in the PCET event leading to an adjustment of oxidation levels for both Au centers prior to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage. We thus describe the oxidation event as a valence tautomerism&#8208;induced PCET where the basicity of one reduced Au&#8722;OH unit provides a proton acceptor and the second more oxidized Au center serves as an electron acceptor. The coordination of these events allows for unprecedented radical&#8208;type reactivity by a closed shell AuII complex.

         <title>Highly Interfacial Active Gemini Surfactants as Simple and Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing, Lubricating and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid structuring usually relies on the interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants. Here we show that not only droplets in non&#8208;equilibrium shapes but also printed liquid patterns with useful geometries can be created from a highly interfacial active molecular Gemini surfactant that generates elastic, &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; monolayers at the oil/water interface. The surfactant can also be used to produce ultra&#8208;stable emulsions with potent lubricity.







Abstract
To date, locking the shape of liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium states usually relies on jamming nanoparticle surfactants at an oil/water interface. Here we show that a synthetic water&#8208;soluble zwitterionic Gemini surfactant can serve as an alternative to nanoparticle surfactants for stabilizing, structuring and additionally lubricating liquids. By having a high binding energy comparable to amphiphilic nanoparticles at the paraffin oil/water interface, the surfactant can attain near&#8208;zero interfacial tensions and ultrahigh surface coverages after spontaneous adsorption. Owing to the strong association between neighboring surfactant molecules, closely packed monolayers with high mechanical elasticity can be generated at the oil/water interface, thus allowing the surfactant to produce not only ultra&#8208;stable emulsions but also structured liquids with various geometries by using extrusion printing and 3D printing techniques. By undergoing tribochemical reactions at its sulfonic terminus, the surfactant can endow the resultant emulsions with favorable lubricity even under high load&#8208;bearing conditions. Our study may provide new insights into creating complex liquid devices and new&#8208;generation lubricants capable of combining the characteristics of both liquid and solid lubricants.

A highly reversible aqueous Zn battery was built by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The design of aqueous zinc (Zn) chemistry energy storage with high rate&#8208;capability and long serving life is a great challenge due to its inhospitable coordination environment and dismal interfacial chemistry. To bridge this big gap, herein, we build a highly reversible aqueous Zn battery by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions. As a result, the engineered electrolyte system achieves a superior average coulombic efficiency of 97.27&#8201;% under 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and steady charge&#8211;discharge for 982&#8197;h under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which proposes a universal pathway to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry in green, sustainable, and large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>A Smart DNA Hydrogel Enables Synergistic Immunotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy of Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA hydrogel that responds to the inflammatory environment by releasing multivalent functional units including photodynamic units, immune&#8208;activating units, and exosome killing units is constructed. The functional units have excellent tumor cell killing and immune activation efficacy, and the functional units can also synergistically modulate the immune microenvironment for efficient combination therapy.







Abstract
Immunotherapy faces insufficient immune activation and limited immune effectiveness. Herein, we report a smart DNA hydrogel that enables the release of multivalent functional units at the tumor site to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. The smart DNA hydrogel was assembled from two types of ultra&#8208;long DNA chains synthesized via rolling circle amplification. One DNA chain contained immune adjuvant CpG oligonucleotides and polyaptamers for loading natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes; the other chain contained multivalent G&#8208;quadruplex for loading photodynamic agents. DNA chains formed DNA hydrogel through base&#8208;pairing. HhaI restriction endonuclease sites were designed between functional units. Upon stimuli in the tumor sites, the hydrogel was effectively cleaved by the released HhaI and disassembled into functional units. Natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes played an anti&#8208;tumor role, and the CpG oligonucleotide activated antigen&#8208;presenting cells to enhance the immunotherapy. Besides the tumor&#8208;killing effect of photodynamic therapy, the generated cellular debris acted as an immune antigen to further enhance the immunotherapeutic effect. In a mouse melanoma orthotopic model, the smart DNA hydrogel as a localized therapeutic agent, achieved a remarkable tumor suppression rate of 91.2&#8201;%. The smart DNA hydrogel exhibited enhanced efficacy of synergistic immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy, expanding the application of DNA materials in biomedicine.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Zn Metal via a Localized Conjugated Layer for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based zinc ion conductor (CPANZ) with a localized conjugated structure is induced and achieved at low temperature by Lewis acidic Zn(OTf)2. The CPANZ layer effectively accelerates the Zn2+ migration but restricts the H+ migration. Encouragingly, the chemical corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction and other side reactions are significantly mitigated at the CPANZ@Zn anode and homogeneous Zn deposition/dissolution is guaranteed.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as promising and efficient energy storage systems owing to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. Nevertheless, the instability of zinc metal anodes, characterized by issues such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions, poses a significant barrier to widespread applications. Herein, we address this challenge by designing a localized conjugated structure comprising a cyclic polyacrylonitrile polymer (CPANZ), induced by a Zn2+&#8208;based Lewis acid (zinc trifluoromethylsulfonate) at a temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C. The CPANZ layer on the Zn anode, enriched with appropriate pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich groups (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;), exhibits a notable affinity for Zn2+ with ample deposition sites. This zincophilic skeleton not only serves as a protective layer to guide the deposition of Zn2+ but also functions as proton channel blocker, regulating the proton flux to mitigate the hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the strong adhesion strength of the CPANZ layer guarantees its sustained protection to the Zn metal during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, the modified zinc electrode demonstrates long cycle life and high durability in both half&#8208;cell and pouch cells. These findings present a feasible approach to designing high performance aqueous anodes by introducing a localized conjugated layer.

         <title>Amine&#8208;releasable Mediator In situ Repair Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;releasable mediator methylammonium pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic (MAPyA) is demonstrated to in situ repair the imperfections in perovskite film. The specific mechanism is that MAPyA&#8208;released methylamine gifts a crystal reconstruction environment by inducing liquid intermediate phase, thus reconvert the microcrystals and residual PbI2 to perfect perovskites in situ. The optimized device exhibits efficiency of 24.06&#8201;% and excellent photostability.







Abstract
Residual lead iodide (PbI2) is deemed to a double&#8208;edged sword in perovskite film as small amounts of PbI2 are beneficial to the photovoltaic performance, but excessive will cause degradation of photovoltaic performance and stability. Herein, an in situ repair strategy has been developed by introducing amine&#8208;releasable mediator (methylammonium pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic, MAPyA) to eliminate over&#8208;residual PbI2 and regulate the crystal quality of perovskite film. Notably, MAPyA can be partially decomposed into methylamine (MA) gas and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic (PyA) during high temperature annealing. The released MA can locally form liquid intermediate phase, facilitating the reconstruction of perovskite microcrystals and residual PbI2. Moreover, the leftover PyA is confirmed to effectively passivate the uncoordinated lead ions in final perovskite film. Based upon this, superior perovskite film with optimized crystal structure and holistic negligible PbI2 is acquired. The assembled device realizes outstanding efficiency of 24.06&#8201;%, and exhibits a remarkable operational stability that maintaining 87&#8201;% of its origin efficiency after continuous illumination for 1480&#8197;h. And the unencapsulated MAPyA&#8208;treated devices present significant uplift in humidity stability (maintaining ~93&#8201;% of the initial efficiency over 1500&#8197;h, 50&#8211;60&#8201;% relative humidity). Furthermore, the further optimization of this strategy with nanoimprint technology proves its superiority in the amplificative preparation for perovskite films.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Functional Imaging Analysis of Engineered Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) analysis was developed for accurately visualizing tumors at cellular, tissue, and animal levels by enhancing metabolic differences. The strategy will potentially aid tumor identification, analysis, and surgical guidance.







Abstract
Functional imaging (FI) techniques have revolutionized tumor imaging by providing information on specific tumor functions, such as glycometabolism. However, tumor cells lack unique molecular characteristics at the molecular level and metabolic pathways, resulting in limited metabolic differences compared to normal cells and increased background signals from FI. To address this limitation, we developed a novel imaging technique termed proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) for accurate visualization of tumors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional imaging (FI) techniques have revolutionized tumor imaging by providing information on specific tumor functions, such as glycometabolism. However, tumor cells lack unique molecular characteristics at the molecular level and metabolic pathways, resulting in limited metabolic differences compared to normal cells and increased background signals from FI. To address this limitation, we developed a novel imaging technique termed proximity-enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) for accurate visualization of tumors. By using &#8220;two adjacent chemically labeled glycoproteins&#8221; as output signals, we significantly enhance the metabolic differences between tumor and normal cells by PEFI, thereby reducing the background signals for analysis and improving the accuracy of tumor functional imaging. Our results demonstrate that PEFI can accurately identify tumors at the cellular, tissue, and animal level, and has potential value in clinical identification and analysis of tumor cells and tissues, as well as in the guidance of clinical tumor resection surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Where do the Fluorine Atoms Go in Inorganic&#8208;Oxide Fluorinations? A Fluorooxoborate Illustration under Terahertz Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
THz spectroscopy is used to show that fluorine atoms have a discernible preference for bonding with sp3&#8208;boron over sp2&#8208;boron in the fluorination reactions of boric acid. This result helps resolve the F/OH substitution structural ambiguity. A reaction pathway for fluorination via the hydrothermal and room&#8208;temperature evaporation reactions is presented which gives insights into previously obscured aspects of the borate&#8208;fluorination process.







Abstract
The substitution of fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms/hydroxyl groups has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the physical and chemical properties of oxides/hydroxides in fluorine chemistry. However, distinguishing fluorine from oxygen/hydroxyl in the reaction products poses a significant challenge in existing characterization methods. In this study, we illustrate that terahertz (THz) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. To this end, we investigated two fluorination reactions of boric acid, utilizing MHF2 (M=Na, C(NH2)3) as fluorine reagents. Through an interplay between THz spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state density functional theory, we have conclusively demonstrated that fluorine atoms exclusively bind with the sp3&#8208;boron but not with the sp2&#8208;boron in the reaction products of Na[B(OH)3][B3O3F2(OH)2] (NaBOFH) and [C(NH2)3]2B3O3F4OH (GBF2). Based on this evidence, we have proposed a reaction pathway for the fluorinations under investigation, a process previously hindered due to structural ambiguity. This work represents a step forward in gaining a deeper understanding of the precise structures and reaction mechanisms involved in the fluorination of oxides/hydroxides, illuminated by the insights provided by THz spectroscopy.

         <title>Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites Promote OH* Formation and Enhance Formate Selectivity: Towards High&#8208;efficiency Glycerol Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts could achieve low potential and high formate selectivity toward glycerol valorization, because the Lewis centers promote OH* formation and the Br&#248;nsted centers enhance selective oxidation of glycerol to formate. This study demonstrates the vital roles of solid&#8208;acid sites in improving the activity and product selectivity for electrocatalytic biomass upcycling.







Abstract
As a sustainable valorization route, electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) involves in formation of key OH* and selective adsorption/cleavage of C&#8722;C(O) intermediates with multi&#8208;step electron transfer, thus suffering from high potential and poor formate selectivity for most non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. So, it remains challenging to understand the structure&#8211;property relationship as well as construct synergistic sites to realize high&#8208;activity and high&#8208;selectivity GOR. Herein, we successfully achieve dual&#8208;high performance with low potentials and superior formate selectivity for GOR by forming synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in Ni&#8208;alloyed Co&#8208;based spinel. The optimized NiCo oxide solid&#8208;acid electrocatalyst exhibits low reaction potential (1.219&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA/cm2) and high formate selectivity (94.0&#8201;%) toward GOR. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pH&#8208;dependence measurements show that the Lewis acid centers could accelerate OH* production, while the Br&#248;nsted acid centers are proved to facilitate high&#8208;selectivity formation of formate. Theoretical calculations reveal that NiCo alloyed oxide shows appropriate d&#8208;band center, thus balancing adsorption/desorption of C&#8722;O intermediates. This study provides new insights into rationally designing solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts for biomass electro&#8208;upcycling.

         <dc:description>
A multidisciplinary pipeline consisting of medicinal chemistry, molecular phenotyping, chemoproteomics, RNA&#8208;sequencing, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)&#8208;mediated gene silencing and in vivo studies led to a novel series of compounds suppressing pathogenic fibroblast activation via Hypoxia up&#8208;regulated protein&#8197;1 (HYOU1) inhibition. The first reported HYOU1 inhibitors are presented as a promising therapeutic approach in fibroblast&#8208;related diseases.







Abstract
Fibroblasts are key regulators of inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. Targeting their activation in these complex diseases has emerged as a novel strategy to restore tissue homeostasis. Here, we present a multidisciplinary lead discovery approach to identify and optimize small molecule inhibitors of pathogenic fibroblast activation. The study encompasses medicinal chemistry, molecular phenotyping assays, chemoproteomics, bulk RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis, target validation experiments, and chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET)/pharmacokinetic (PK)/in vivo evaluation. The parallel synthesis employed for the production of the new benzamide derivatives enabled us to a)&#8197;pinpoint key structural elements of the scaffold that provide potent fibroblast&#8208;deactivating effects in cells, b)&#8197;discriminate atoms or groups that favor or disfavor a desirable ADMET profile, and c)&#8197;identify metabolic &#8220;hot spots&#8221;. Furthermore, we report the discovery of the first&#8208;in&#8208;class inhibitor leads for hypoxia up&#8208;regulated protein&#8197;1 (HYOU1), a member of the heat shock protein&#8197;70 (HSP70) family often associated with cellular stress responses, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Targeting HYOU1 may therefore represent a potentially novel strategy to modulate fibroblast activation and treat chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disorders.

         <title>Reduction of Superoxide Radical Intermediate by Polydopamine for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine (PDA) containing pyrrole nitrogen atoms not only promotes charge separation but also serves as a &#8901;O2&#8722; adsorption reduction active site for efficient H2O2 production. In the absence of sacrificial reagents, the H2O2 yield of CN&#8208;PDA was 742.8&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1, 47&#8197;times higher than CN.







Abstract
The synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through artificial photosynthesis is a green and promising technology with advantages in sustainability, economy and safety. However, superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), an important intermediate in photocatalytic oxygen reduction to H2O2 production, has strong oxidizing properties that potentially destabilize the catalyst. Therefore, avoiding the accumulation of &#8901;O2&#8722; for its rapid conversion to H2O2 is of paramount significance in improving catalyst stability and H2O2 yield. In this work, a strategy was developed to utilize protonated groups for the rapid depletion of converted &#8901;O2&#8722;, thereby the efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 from CN was successfully enhanced by 47&#8208;fold. The experimental findings demonstrated that polydopamine not only improved carrier separation efficiency, and more importantly, provided the adsorption reduction active site for &#8901;O2&#8722; for efficient H2O2 production. This work offers a versatile approach for synthesizing efficient and stable photocatalysts.

In the absence of sacrificial reagents, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of CN-PDA was 742.8&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 47&#8197;times higher than CN.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through artificial photosynthesis is a green and promising technology with advantages in sustainability, economy and safety. However, superoxide radical (&#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), an important intermediate in photocatalytic oxygen reduction to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, has strong oxidizing properties that potentially destabilize the catalyst. Therefore, avoiding the accumulation of &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for its rapid conversion to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is of paramount significance in improving catalyst stability and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield. In this work, a strategy was developed to utilize protonated groups for the rapid depletion of converted &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby the efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CN was successfully enhanced by 47-fold. The experimental findings demonstrated that polydopamine not only improved carrier separation efficiency, and more importantly, provided the adsorption reduction active site for &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. This work offers a versatile approach for synthesizing efficient and stable photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Surface Terminations for Charge Storage of Ti3C2Tx MXene Electrodes in Aqueous Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition from electrochemically inactive Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to fast, pseudocapacitive behavior is reported for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene, attributed to the presence of confined water between the MXene layers. This study evidences the crucial role surface terminations and confined water in charge storage and reaction kinetics in MXene materials.







Abstract
In this study, we used 2&#8208;Dimmensionnal Ti3C2 MXene as model materials to understand how the surface groups affect their electrochemical performance. By adjusting the nature of the surface terminations (Cl&#8208;, N/O&#8208;, and O&#8208;) of Ti3C2 MXene through a molten salt approach, we could change the spacing between MXene layers and the level of water confinement, resulting in significant modifications of the electrochemical performance in acidic electrolyte. Using a combination of techniques including in&#8208;operando X&#8208;ray diffraction and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we found that the presence of confined water results in a drastic transition from an almost electrochemically inactive behavior for Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to an ideally fast pseudocapacitive signature for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene. This experimental work not only demonstrates the strong connection between surface terminations and confined water but also reveals the importance of confined water on the charge storage mechanism and the reaction kinetics in MXene.

         <title>Terminal Copper Nitrenoid Formation and Reactivity Induced by Absorption to an Antenna Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H amination reactions but are difficult to study due to their high reactivity. This research shows that absorption to an antenna ligand can promote the denitrogenation of copper azide complexes in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote the C&#8722;H amination reaction, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.







Abstract
Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H amination reactions. Further development of this important reaction relies on knowing the properties and reactivity of the nitrenoid intermediates. This work utilizes antenna ligands to form copper nitrenoid complexes and monitor the consecutive C&#8722;H amination reactions under well&#8208;defined single&#8208;molecule conditions in the gas phase. The [Cu(Lphoto)(Lazide)]+ precursors (Lphoto is a bidentate antenna ligand, and Lazide is an organic azide) were stored in an ion trap at 3.5&#8197;K and irradiated by visible light, which resulted in denitrogenation of the complex. Further irradiation of the copper nitrenoid led to the consecutive C&#8722;H amination of the antenna ligand. The nitrenoid complexes, as well as the products of the C&#8722;H amination, were characterized by helium tagging IRPD spectroscopy, and the mechanism was described by DFT calculations. This research demonstrates that the antenna ligands can be used to promote the denitrogenation of metal azides in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote further reactivity, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization control of perovskite thin films is the key in commerciallization of perovskite solar cells. However, the fast crystallization of the thin film including nucleation, growth and Oswald ripening, is still a mystery though some efforts made. According to the theories of nucleation and Oswald ripening, we modified the perovskite surface energy and improved the grain solubility, and quantified the nucleation and ripening rate in experiments. 







Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9&#8197;mN/m to 36.1&#8197;mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 to 4.61&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 800&#8197;h aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Dimerized Giant Acceptors with Different Alkyl&#8208;Linked Sites for Stable and 19.13&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new non&#8208;fully conjugated dimerized giant acceptors with different alkyl&#8208;linked sites are developed. Among them, wing&#8208;sited 2Y&#8208;wing has fine&#8208;tuned packing and better miscibility with donor, allowing to 19.13&#8201;% efficiency (which is the highest value among the devices with giant acceptors) and highly stable organic solar cells.







Abstract
Achieving both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device stability is a major challenge for the practical development of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three non&#8208;fully conjugated dimerized giant acceptors (named 2Y&#8208;sites, including wing&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;wing, core&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;core, and end&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;end) are developed. They share the similar monomer precursors but have different alkyl&#8208;linked sites, offering the fine&#8208;tuned molecular absorption, packing, glass transition temperature, and carrier mobility. Among their binary active layers, D18/2Y&#8208;wing has better miscibility, leading to optimized morphology and more efficient charge transfer compared to D18/2Y&#8208;core and D18/2Y&#8208;end. Therefore, the D18/2Y&#8208;wing&#8208;based OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 17.73&#8201;%, attributed to enhanced photocurrent and fill factor. Furthermore, the D18/2Y&#8208;wing&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a balance of high PCE and improved stability, distinguishing them within the 2Y&#8208;sites. Building on the success of 2Y&#8208;wing in binary systems, we extend its application to ternary OSCs by pairing it with the near&#8208;infrared absorbing D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F host. Thanks to the complementary absorption within 300&#8211;970&#8197;nm and further optimized morphology, ternary OSCs obtain a higher PCE of 19.13&#8201;%, setting a new efficiency benchmark for the dimer&#8208;derived OSCs. This approach of alkyl&#8208;linked site engineering for constructing dimerized giant acceptors presents a promising pathway to improve both PCE and stability of OSCs.

Herein, three non-fully conjugated dimerized giant acceptors (named 2Y-sites, including wing-site-linked 2Y-wing, core-site-linked 2Y-core, and end-site-linked 2Y-end) are developed. They share the similar monomer precursors but have different alkyl-linked sites, offering the fine-tuned molecular absorption, packing, glass transition temperature, and carrier mobility. Among their binary active layers, D18/2Y-wing has better miscibility, leading to optimized morphology and more efficient charge transfer compared to D18/2Y-core and D18/2Y-end. Therefore, the D18/2Y-wing-based OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 17.73&#8201;%, attributed to enhanced photocurrent and fill factor. Furthermore, the D18/2Y-wing-based OSCs exhibit a balance of high PCE and improved stability, distinguishing them within the 2Y-sites. Building on the success of 2Y-wing in binary systems, we extend its application to ternary OSCs by pairing it with the near-infrared absorbing D18/BS3TSe-4F host. Thanks to the complementary absorption within 300&#8211;970&#8197;nm and further optimized morphology, ternary OSCs obtain a higher PCE of 19.13&#8201;%, setting a new efficiency benchmark for the dimer-derived OSCs. This approach of alkyl-linked site engineering for constructing dimerized giant acceptors presents a promising pathway to improve both PCE and stability of OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Catalytic RNA Circuits for Construction of Artificial Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes an amplifiable RNA circuit based on the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function, which can directly build regulatory connections between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells. With this design, artificial signaling pathways can be introduced into mammalian cells to control cellular responses and phenotypes through differentiated RNA expression.







Abstract
Engineering of genetic networks with artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells. We harness the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function to transduce the signals from distinct messenger RNA expression of trigger genes into manipulation of target genes. Through introduction of these RNA&#8208;based genetic circuits, mammalian cells are endowed with autonomous capabilities to sense the changes of RNA expression either induced by ligand stimuli or from various cell types and control the cellular responses and fates via apoptosis&#8208;related ASPs. Our design provides a generalized platform for construction of ASPs inside the genetic networks of mammalian cells based on differentiated RNA expression.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Molecular Motor&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers Revealed by High&#8208;Speed AFM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic light&#8208;triggered depolymerisation of chiral molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymers has been observed in real time with High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM). These results show the depolymerisation selectively from the polymer ends through a cooperative process.







Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers have a major potential for applications in responsive materials that are externally triggered by light with spatio&#8208;temporal control of their polymerisation state. While changes in macroscopic properties revealed the adaptive nature of these materials, it remains challenging to capture the dynamic depolymerisation process at the molecular level, which requires fast observation techniques combined with in situ irradiation. By implementing in situ UV illumination into a High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscope (HS&#8208;AFM) setup, we have been able to capture the disassembly of a light&#8208;driven molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymer. The real&#8208;time visualisation of the light&#8208;triggered disassembly process not only reveals cooperative depolymerisation, it also shows that this process continues after illumination is halted. Combining the data with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and spectroscopy approaches, we obtain a molecular&#8208;level description of the motor&#8208;based polymer dynamics reminiscent of actin chain&#8208;end depolymerisation. Our detailed understanding of supramolecular depolymerisation will drive the development of future responsive polymer systems.

         <title>Simple Functionalization of a Donor Monomer to Enhance Charge Transfer in Porous Polymer Networks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs were synthesized to investigate how the existence of a hexyl functional group would affect charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit ensured the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity and hydrogen production.







Abstract
Porous polymer networks (PPNs) are promising candidates as photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor structure is known to be an effective approach for improving photocatalytic activity. However, the process of how a functional group of a monomer can ensure photoexcited charges transfer and improve the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) has not yet been studied on the molecular level. Herein, we design and synthesize two kinds of triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs: TATR&#8208;PPN with a hexyl (R) group and TAT&#8208;PPN without the hexyl group, to understand the relationship between the presence of the functional group and charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit was found to ensure the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit and endowed the TATR&#8208;PPN with stable hydrogen production.

         <title>Making Plasticized Polymer Electrolytes Stable Against Sodium Metal for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A new plasticized polymer electrolyte integrated with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive was reported to address the interface instability issue existing in sodium metal batteries. Impressively, dome&#8208;like Na0 nucleation/growth with thin, amorphous, and fluoride&#8208;rich SEIs was identified, enabling excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 pouch cells (93.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3) at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes based on plastic crystals are promising for solid&#8208;state sodium metal (Na0) batteries, yet their practicality has been hindered by the notorious Na0&#8208;electrolyte interface instability issue, the underlying cause of which remains poorly understood. Here, by leveraging a model plasticized polymer electrolyte based on conventional succinonitrile plastic crystals, we uncover its failure origin in Na0 batteries is associated with the formation of a thick and non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and whiskery Na0 nucleation/growth. Furthermore, we design a new additive&#8208;embedded plasticized polymer electrolyte to manipulate the Na0 deposition and SEI formulation. For the first time, we demonstrate that introducing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive into the succinonitrile&#8208;plasticized polymer electrolyte can effectively protect Na0 against interfacial corrosion by facilitating the growth of dome&#8208;like Na0 with thin, amorphous, and fluorine&#8208;rich SEIs, thus enabling significantly improved performances of Na//Na symmetric cells (1,800&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (93.0&#8201;% capacity retention after 1,200 cycles at 1&#8197;C rate in coin cells and 93.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3 in pouch cells at room temperature). Our work provides valuable insights into the interfacial failure of plasticized polymer electrolytes and offers a promising solution to resolving the interfacial instability issue.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Covalent Organic Framework in the Presence of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;containing&#8208;species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2 was proposed. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from the oxygen reduction reaction could decrease the energy barrier for the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center and thus boost the CO2RR performance.







Abstract
Herein, we propose an oxygen&#8208;containing species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2. A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF), denoted as NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that is composed of the Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) unit with well&#8208;defined Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites and the salen(Co)2 moiety with binuclear Co&#8722;N2O2 sites, is developed and synthesized for enhancing the CO2RR under aerobic condition. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from ORR could decrease the energy barrier of the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center. Besides, the oxygen species axially coordinated Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites can favor in reducing the energy barrier of the intermediate *COOH formation for the CO2RR. Thus, NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF exhibits high oxygen&#8208;tolerant CO2RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V in the presence of 0.5&#8201;% O2, which is superior to that in pure CO2 feed gas (FECO=94.8&#8201;%, jCO=19.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Notably, the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 128.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow&#8208;cell reactor with 0.5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V, which is higher than that in pure CO2 atmosphere (jCO=104.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). It is worth noting that an excellent FECO of 86.8&#8201;% is still achieved in the presence of 5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V. This work provides an effective strategy to enable the CO2RR under O2 atmosphere by utilizing the *OOH intermediates of ORR to boost CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Regulated Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species from Porphyrin&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metallacage exhibited strong host&#8208;guest interactions with fullerene derivatives. The complexes could be dissembled by the further addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine to form a more stable coordinated complex. This tunable host&#8208;guest complexation was further employed to generate different types of reactive oxygen species, enabling the highly efficient and selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols.







Abstract
The development of novel materials for highly efficient and selective photocatalysis is crucial for their practical applications. Herein, we employ the host&#8208;guest chemistry of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species and further use them for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols. Upon irradiation, the sole metallacage (6) can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) effectively via excited energy transfer, while its complex with C70 (6&#8835;C70) opens a pathway for electron transfer to promote the formation of superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;), producing both 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. The addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BPY) to complex 6&#8835;C70 forms a more stable complex (6&#8835;BPY) via the coordination of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin faces of 6 and BPY, which drives fullerenes out of the cavities and restores the ability of 1O2 generation. Therefore, benzyl alcohols are oxidized into benzyl aldehydes upon irradiation in the presence of 6 or 6&#8835;BPY, while they are oxidized into benzoic acids when 6&#8835;C70 is employed as the photosensitizing agent. This study demonstrates a highly efficient strategy that utilizes the host&#8208;guest chemistry of metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species for selective photooxidation reactions, which could promote the utilization of metallacages and their related host&#8208;guest complexes for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Stilbene Pairs in a DNA Duplex Mediated by Ruthenium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to site&#8208;specifically crosslink DNA duplex upon visible light irradiation. Ru complex on the third strand catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site specificity is realized owing to steep distance dependence of the energy transfer. This method will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.







Abstract
We herein report a method for site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of a DNA duplex. A stilbene pair was introduced into a DNA duplex and a ruthenium complex was conjugated with a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide. We demonstrated that [2+2] photocycloaddition of the stilbene pair occurred upon irradiation with visible light when the ruthenium complex was in close proximity due to triplex formation. No reaction occurred when the ruthenium complex was not in proximity to the stilbene pair. The wavelength of visible light used was of lower energy than the wavelength of UV light necessary for direct excitation of stilbene. Quantum chemical calculation indicated that ruthenium complex catalyzed the photocycloaddition via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site selectivity of this photo&#8208;crosslinking system was evaluated using a DNA duplex bearing two stilbene pairs as a substrate; we showed that the site of crosslinking was precisely regulated by the sequence of the oligonucleotide linked to the ruthenium complex. Since this method does not require orthogonal photoresponsive molecules, it will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric with Afterglow Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enable a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature (&#916;TC=114.4&#8197;K), but also realize the first integration of notable ferroelectricity and long afterglow emission in (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 with one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite architecture.







Abstract
Luminescent ferroelectrics are holding exciting prospect for integrated photoelectronic devices due to potential light&#8208;polarization interactions at electron scale. Integrating ferroelectricity and long&#8208;lived afterglow emission in a single material would offer new possibilities for fundamental research and applications, however, related reports have been a blank to date. For the first time, we here achieved the combination of notable ferroelectricity and afterglow emission in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material. Remarkably, the presented (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 also shows noticeable antiferroelectric behavior. The implementation of cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enables a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 114.4&#8197;K but also brings a record longest emission lifetime up to 117.11&#8197;ms under ambient conditions, realizing a leapfrog improvement of at least two orders of magnitude compared to reported hybrid ferroelectrics so far. This finding would herald the emergence of novel application potential, such as multi&#8208;level density data storage or multifunctional sensors, towards the future integrated optoelectronic devices with multitasking capabilities.

For the first time, we here achieved the combination of notable ferroelectricity and afterglow emission in an organic-inorganic hybrid material. Remarkably, the presented (4-methylpiperidium)CdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also shows noticeable antiferroelectric behavior. The implementation of cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enables a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 114.4&#8197;K but also brings a record longest emission lifetime up to 117.11&#8197;ms under ambient conditions, realizing a leapfrog improvement of at least two orders of magnitude compared to reported hybrid ferroelectrics so far. This finding would herald the emergence of novel application potential, such as multi-level density data storage or multifunctional sensors, towards the future integrated optoelectronic devices with multitasking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation and Transfer Hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Nitrones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reduction of 1,3&#8208;dipolar nitrones to hydroxylamines was achieved by Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation. A wide range of chiral N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydroxylamines were synthesized with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate the origin of reactivity and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Owing to their distinctive 1,3&#8208;dipolar structure, the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of nitrones to hydroxylamines has been a formidable and longstanding challenge, characterized by intricate enantiocontrol and susceptibility to N&#8722;O bond cleavage. In this study, the asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of nitrones were accomplished with a tethered TsDPEN&#8208;derived cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) catalyst (TsDPEN: p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), the reaction proceeds via a novel 7&#8208;membered cyclic transition state, producing chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. The practical viability of this methodology was underscored by gram&#8208;scale catalytic reactions and subsequent transformations. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were also conducted to elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Breaking Iron Homeostasis: Iron Capturing Nanocomposites for Combating Bacterial Biofilm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacteria spend years in a dormant, inactive state, yet revive in some nutrient environments. Iron nutritional immunity strategy was proposed to target iron nutrients. We developed a nanoplatform that can deceive bacteria to uptake &#8220;fake iron&#8221; and concurrently extract iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu, starving pathogens to death.







Abstract
Given the scarcity of novel antibiotics, the eradication of bacterial biofilm infections poses formidable challenges. Upon bacterial infection, the host restricts Fe ions, which are crucial for bacterial growth and maintenance. Having coevolved with the host, bacteria developed adaptive pathways like the hemin&#8208;uptake system to avoid iron deficiency. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy, termed iron nutritional immunity therapy (INIT), utilizing Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites constructed with gallium, copper&#8208;doped tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) metal&#8211;organic framework, and polyamine&#8208;amine polymer dots, to target bacterial iron intakes and starve them. Owing to the similarity between iron/hemin and gallium/TCPP, gallium&#8208;incorporated porphyrin potentially deceives bacteria into uptaking gallium ions and concurrently extracts iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu through the porphyrin ring. This strategy orchestrates a &#8220;give and take&#8221; approach for Ga3+/Fe3+ exchange. Simultaneously, polymer dots can impede bacterial iron metabolism and serve as real&#8208;time fluorescent iron&#8208;sensing probes to continuously monitor dynamic iron restriction status. INIT based on Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites induced long&#8208;term iron starvation, which affected iron&#8208;sulfur cluster biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism, ultimately facilitating biofilm eradication and tissue regeneration. Therefore, this study presents an innovative antibacterial strategy from a nutritional perspective that sheds light on refractory bacterial infection treatment and its future clinical application.

A rapid functional group transformation method that converts metabolic carboxylic acids into a new ketone within 10 minutes using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine (the bait for the fish) has been developed by Daniel Globisch et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202318579). The newly formed ketone was then captured by the chemical probe methodology Quant&#8208;SCHEMA (the fishing device) for quantification of all carboxylic acids even at very low quantities (depth of the ocean). This bifunctional methodology represents a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.

The nature of adsorbed oxygen species determines the product selectivity in the oxidative coupling of CH4 as shown on the cover. In their Communication (e202319192), Guiyuan Jiang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko et&#8197;al. describe how the formation of carbon oxides and ethane correlates with the binding strength of selective mono&#8208;atomic oxygen species. The strength affects the probability of their recombination to diatomic oxygen species oxidizing methane to carbon oxides. Cover image credit: Vita A. Kondratenko.

Distinguish good from evil by selective endosomal escape. The nuanced endo/lysosomal activity of cathepsin B across cell types can act as a stimulus for cell&#8208;specific endosomal escape of proteins before degradation. In their Research Article (e202317817), Kazunori Kataoka, Horacio Cabral, et&#8197;al. report nanocarriers leveraging on this differentiated cathepsin B activity to achieve cancer cell&#8208;specific delivery of antibodies. This innovative approach offers a new means for targeted intracellular delivery.

Site&#8208;selective photocrosslinking of DNA duplex was achieved in the Research Article (e202319516) by Hiromu Kashida, Hiroyuki Asanuma et&#8197;al. A ruthenium complex on a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide effectively catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties in a DNA duplex under visible light. Since the reaction proceeds via triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer, the reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Radiochemistry with Fluorine&#8208;18, Carbon&#8208;11&#8201;and Zirconium&#8208;89</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent developments in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry, focusing on key isotopes (fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, zirconium&#8208;89) in positron emission tomography (PET). These technologies have been used to radiolabel small molecules, peptides and larger biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies.







Abstract
This review discusses recent advances in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry for three key isotopes: fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, and zirconium&#8208;89, and their applications in positron emission tomography (PET). In the case of fluorine&#8208;18, the predominant approach involves the use of cyclotron&#8208;produced [18F]fluoride or reagents derived thereof. Light serves to activate either the substrate or the fluorine&#8208;18 labeled reagent. Advancements in carbon&#8208;11 photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry have been leveraged for the radiolabeling of small molecules, achieving various transformations, including 11C&#8208;methylation, 11C&#8208;carboxylation, 11C&#8208;carbonylation, and 11C&#8208;cyanation. Contrastingly, zirconium&#8208;89 photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry differs from fluorine&#8208;18 and carbon&#8208;11 approaches. In these cases, light facilitates a postlabeling click reaction, which has proven valuable for the labeling of large biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). New technological developments, such as the incorporation of photoreactors in commercial radiosynthesizers, illustrate the commitment the field is making in embracing photochemistry. Taken together, these advances in photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry enable radiochemists to apply new retrosynthetic strategies in accessing novel PET radiotracers.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Functionalization of Bicycloalkanes, Cubanes and Related Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review aims to provide an overview on the recent photochemical strategies for the construction and/or functionalization of bicycloalkanes, cubanes, and some of their heterocyclic structural analogues. The synthetic methods have been organized according to the molecular target, and with a particular emphasis on the type of photochemical mechanisms involved. Future perspectives and open synthetic challenges within the field are presented.







Abstract
Bicycloalkanes, cubanes and their structural analogues have emerged as bioisosteres of (hetero)arenes. To meet increasing demand, the chemical community has developed a plethora of novel synthetic methods. In this review, we assess the progress made in the field of light&#8208;driven construction and functionalization of such relevant molecules. We have focused on diverse structural targets, as well as on reaction processes giving access to: (i) [1.1.1]&#8208;bicyclopentanes (BCPs); (ii) [2.2.1]&#8208;bicyclohexanes (BCHs); (iii) [3.1.1]&#8208;bicycloheptanes (BCHeps); and (iv) cubanes; as well as other structurally related scaffolds. Finally, future perspectives dealing with the identification of novel reaction manifolds to access new functionalized bioisosteric units are discussed.

         <title>Intermediates in Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview we present and discussed a series of examples from various areas in which reactive intermediates have been detected during mechanochemical reactions. Understanding the factors behind the formation and stabilization of these intermediates could enhance mechanochemical methods and chemical reaction development.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions offer methodological and environmental advantages for chemical synthesis, constantly attracting attention within the scientific community. Besides unmistakable sustainability advantages, the conditions under which mechanochemical reactions occur, namely solventless conditions, sometimes facilitate the isolation of otherwise labile or inaccessible products. Despite these advantages, limited knowledge exists regarding the mechanisms of these reactions and the types of intermediates involved. Nevertheless, in an expanding number of cases, ex situ and in situ monitoring techniques have allowed for the observation, characterization, and isolation of reaction intermediates in mechanochemical transformations. In this Minireview, we present a series of examples in which reactive intermediates have been detected in mechanochemical reactions spanning organic, organometallic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Many of these intermediates were stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which played a pivotal role in guiding the chemical transformations. We believe that by uncovering and understanding such instances, the growing mechanochemistry community could find novel opportunities in catalysis and discover new mechanochemical reactions while achieving simplification in chemical reaction design.

         <title>Artificial Homeostasis Systems Based on Feedback Reaction Networks: Design Principles and Future Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review shows how to design feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks in different molecular systems that have a range of non&#8208;linear functions. These networks are a useful set of tools for creating chemical systems and materials that are interactive and have homeostasis&#8208;like animate features. These discoveries pave the way for the development of forthcoming next&#8208;generation systems and materials.







Abstract
Feedback&#8208;controlled chemical reaction networks (FCRNs) are indispensable for various biological processes, such as cellular mechanisms, patterns, and signaling pathways. Through the intricate interplay of many feedback loops (FLs), FCRNs maintain a stable internal cellular environment. Currently, creating minimalistic synthetic cells is the long&#8208;term objective of systems chemistry, which is motivated by such natural integrity. The design, kinetic optimization, and analysis of FCRNs to exhibit functions akin to those of a cell still pose significant challenges. Indeed, reaching synthetic homeostasis is essential for engineering synthetic cell components. However, maintaining homeostasis in artificial systems against various agitations is a difficult task. Several biological events can provide us with guidelines for a conceptual understanding of homeostasis, which can be further applicable in designing artificial synthetic systems. In this regard, we organize our review with artificial homeostasis systems driven by FCRNs at different length scales, including homogeneous, compartmentalized, and soft material systems. First, we stretch a quick overview of FCRNs in different molecular and supramolecular systems, which are the essential toolbox for engineering different nonlinear functions and homeostatic systems. Moreover, the existing history of synthetic homeostasis in chemical and material systems and their advanced functions with self&#8208;correcting, and regulating properties are also emphasized.

         <title>Designing Multifunctional Biomaterials via Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview sums up cutting&#8208;edge concepts regarding the formation of protein&#8208;based supramolecular structures, compartmentalization, and self&#8208;assembly monitoring; it compares the routes of their modifications and applications in multifunctional biomaterial design. We summarize the current knowledge about machine learning/artificial intelligence applications for protein structure prediction/obtainment and link it to biomaterial performance.







Abstract
Protein self&#8208;assembly is a fundamental biological process where proteins spontaneously organize into complex and functional structures without external direction. This process is crucial for the formation of various biological functionalities. However, when protein self&#8208;assembly fails, it can trigger the development of multiple disorders, thus making understanding this phenomenon extremely important. Up until recently, protein self&#8208;assembly has been solely linked either to biological function or malfunction; however, in the past decade or two it has also been found to hold promising potential as an alternative route for fabricating materials for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the key aspects of protein self&#8208;assembly: how the protein structure and self&#8208;assembly conditions (chemical environments, kinetics, and the physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes) can be utilized to design biomaterials. This minireview focuses on the basic concepts of forming supramolecular structures, and the existing routes for modifications. We then compare the applicability of different approaches, including compartmentalization and self&#8208;assembly monitoring. Finally, based on the cutting&#8208;edge progress made during the last years, we summarize the current knowledge about tailoring a final function by introducing changes in self&#8208;assembly and link it to biomaterials&#8217; performance.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Aminoarylation of Butadienes via Photoinduced Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing readily available and cost&#8208;effective aryl halides, amines, and butadienes as starting materials, in conjunction with rac&#8208;BINAP and a Pd catalyst, we can efficiently synthesize highly valuable complex allylamines through a rapid one&#8208;step process enabled by photocatalysis.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, three&#8208;component palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aminoarylation of butadienes with readily available aryl halides and aliphatic amines has been developed, affording allylamines with excellent E&#8208;selectivity. The reaction exhibits exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group compatibility, as demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations are consistent with a photoinduced radical Pd(0)&#8208;Pd(I)&#8208;Pd(II)&#8208;Pd(0) Heck&#8208;Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation cascade.

         <title>Foldaxane&#8208;Based Switchable [c2]Daisy Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic helical foldamer linked to a peptide rod, which is incapable of self&#8208;complexation or polymerization, has been shown to preferentially assemble through inter&#8208;strand hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions into a [c2]daisy chain that undergoes fast contraction/stretching muscle&#8208;like motion without dissociation. The introduction of multiple recognition sites confers the system with contraction and stretching motion actuated by chemical stimuli.







Abstract
Artificial molecular muscles are highly attractive in the field of molecular machinery due to their unique properties of contraction and stretching motion. However, the synthesis of molecular muscles poses formidable challenges as it is hindered by undesirable yields and poor selectivity. Herein, we present a procedure for the dynamic assembly of foldaxane&#8208;based [c2]daisy chains, wherein the hermaphroditic sequences consisting of aromatic helices and peptide rods are interlocked through inter&#8208;strand hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The binding complementarity facilitates a selective and efficient assembly of [c2]daisy chain structures, inhibiting the creation of by&#8208;products. Introducing multiple recognition sites confers the system with contraction and stretching motion actuated by chemical stimuli. The rate of this muscle&#8208;like motion is calculated to be 0.8&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is 107&#8197;times faster than that of complex dissociation.

         <title>Sortase&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Domain Inversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to mimic the conventional N&#8208;terminal sortase substrate at protein C&#8208;termini is reported, enabling C&#8208; to C&#8208;terminal ligation. Installing this mimetic at the C&#8208;terminus of a protein with an internal sortase recognition motif enables sortase&#8208;catalyzed inversion of the C&#8208;terminal portion of the protein.







Abstract
Topological transformations and permutations of proteins have attracted significant interest as strategies to generate new protein functionalities or stability. These efforts have mainly been inspired by naturally occurring post&#8208;translational modifications, such as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, circular permutation, or lasso&#8208;like entanglement. Such approaches can be realized experimentally via genetic encoding, in the case of circular permutation, or via enzymatic processing, in the case of cyclization. Notably, these previously described strategies leave the polypeptide backbone orientation unaltered. Here we describe an unnatural protein permutation, the protein domain inversion, whereby a C&#8208;terminal portion of a protein is enzymatically inverted from the canonical N&#8208;to&#8208;C to a C&#8208;to&#8208;C configuration with respect to the N&#8208;terminal part of the protein. The closest conceptually analogous biological process is perhaps the inversion of DNA segments as catalyzed by recombinases. We achieve these inversions using an engineered sortase A, a widely used transpeptidase. Our reactions proceed efficiently under mild conditions at 4&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and are compatible with entirely heterologously&#8208;produced protein substrates.

         <title>A New Architecture for DNA&#8208;Templated Synthesis in Which Abasic Sites Protect Reactants from Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abasic site within a DNA duplex reduces hydrolysis of a colocalised DNA&#8208;thioester. This forms the basis for an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis which protects DNA&#8208;tagged building blocks until a DNA strand exchange reaction removes the protective site and colocalizes a second reactive group.







Abstract
The synthesis of artificial sequence&#8208;defined polymers that match and extend the functionality of proteins is an important goal in materials science. One way of achieving this is to program a sequence of chemical reactions between precursor building blocks by means of attached oligonucleotide adapters. However, hydrolysis of the reactive building blocks has so far limited the length and yield of product that can be obtained using DNA&#8208;templated reactions. Here, we report an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in which reactants are tethered at internal abasic sites on opposite strands of a DNA duplex. We show that an abasic site within a DNA duplex can protect a nearby thioester from degradation, significantly increasing the yield of a DNA&#8208;templated reaction. This protective effect has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with programmable, sequence&#8208;controlled synthesis of long non&#8208;natural polymers by extending the lifetime of the reactive building blocks.

         <title>Tertiary Amides as Directing Groups for Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination using Ion&#8208;Paired Rhodium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds generates important stereocenters. Our approach, in which the chirality of a bimetallic rhodium complex is located on its associated cations, achieves this on tertiary amide&#8208;containing substrates to give amination of arylbutyric and arylvaleric acid&#8208;derived amides. We believe that the amide most likely interacts directly with the chiral cation to provide a highly organised transition state for C&#8722;H amination.







Abstract
Enantioselective C&#8722;H amination at a benzylic methylene is a vital disconnection towards chiral benzylamines. Here we disclose that butyric and valeric acid&#8208;derived tertiary amides can undergo highly enantioselective benzylic amination using an achiral anionic Rh complex that is ion&#8208;paired with a Cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived chiral cation. A broad scope of compounds can be aminated encompassing numerous arene substitutions, amides, and two different chain lengths. Excellent tolerance of ortho substituents was observed, which has not been achieved before in asymmetric intermolecular C&#8722;H amination with Rh. We speculate that the tertiary amide group of the substrate engages in hydrogen bonding interactions directly with the chiral cation, enabling a high level of organisation at the transition state for C&#8722;H amination. This is in contrast with our previous work where a substrate bearing a hydrogen bond donor was required. Control experiments led to the discovery that methyl ethers also function as proficient directing groups under the optimised conditions, potentially also acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. This finding has the promise to dramatically expand the applicability of our ion&#8208;paired chiral catalysts.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Radical Cascade to a Chiral Saddle&#8208;Shaped Peropyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Undesired reaction pathways of open&#8208;shell graphene fragments can be synthetically useful! To demonstrate their transformative potential, we employed oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene&#8212;the well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;radical &#8220;decomposition&#8221; process&#8212;to build up strain and access negatively curved and configurationally stable chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Reactions of open&#8208;shell molecular graphene fragments are typically thought of as undesired decomposition processes because they lead to the loss of desired features like &#960;&#8208;magnetism. Oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene shows, however, that these transformations hold promise as a synthetic tool for making complex structures via formation of multiple bonds and rings in a single step. Here, we explore the feasibility of using this &#8220;undesired&#8221; reaction of phenalenyl to build up strain and provide access to non&#8208;planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To this end, we designed and synthesized a biradical system with two phenalenyl units linked via a biphenylene backbone. The design facilitates an intramolecular cascade reaction to a helically twisted saddle&#8208;shaped product, where the key transformations&#8212;ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;fusion&#8212;occur within one reaction. The negative curvature of the final peropyrene product, induced by the formed eight&#8208;membered ring, was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the helical twist was validated via resolution of the product's enantiomers that display circularly polarized luminescence and high configurational stability.

         <title>Rapid and Bifunctional Chemoselective Metabolome Analysis of Liver Disease Plasma Using the Reagent 4&#8208;Nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid functional group transformation of carboxylic acids into a new ketone under mild conditions using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. The newly formed ketone was captured by our chemical probe methodology for quantification with enhanced mass spectrometric sensitivity. This bifunctional methodology is a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.







Abstract
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging. Derivatization of carboxylic acids represents a strategy to overcome these limitations but available methods suffer from diverse analytical challenges. Herein, we have designed a novel strategy introducing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine as a new chemoselective moiety for the first time for carboxylic acid metabolites. This moiety was selected as it rapidly forms a stable amide bond and also generates a new ketone, which can be analyzed by our recently developed quant&#8208;SCHEMA method specific for carbonyl metabolites. Optimization of this new method revealed a high reproducibility and robustness, which was utilized to validate 102&#8197;metabolic carboxylic acids using authentic synthetic standard conjugates in human plasma samples including nine metabolites that were newly detected. Using this sequential analysis of the carbonyl&#8208; and carboxylic acid&#8208;metabolomes revealed alterations of the ketogenesis pathway, which demonstrates the vast benefit of our unique methodology. We anticipate that the developed azirine moiety with rapid functional group transformation will find broad application in diverse chemical biology research fields.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Ruthenium(BINAP)(PPh3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a Ru(0)(BINAP)(PPh3) complex (BINAP:2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl) is reported. It behaves as a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;electron Ru(0) complex: while being quite stable, it is capable to substitute PPh3 with alkenes/dienes, and activate C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H or inert N&#8722;Et bonds. This compound gives novel insight into Ru(0) stabilization approaches while maintaining a high specific reactivity potentially useful for catalytic applications.







Abstract
Ru(BINAP)(PPh3)HCl cleanly reacts with LiCH2TMS to give Ru(BINAP)(PPh3) (1) that has been fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction (BINAP and TMS stand for (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl and trimethylsilyl respectively). In sharp contrast with other carbonyl&#8208;free phosphine complexes of Ru(0), 1 demonstrates a strikingly high thermal stability and no propensity for intramolecular C&#8722;H activation (cyclometalation). Yet 1 coordinates acetonitrile and readily exchanges its PPh3 ligand with alkenes and dienes, thus behaving like a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;e Ru(0) species. Electron&#8208;poor alkenes coordinate more readily than electron&#8208;rich ones, which testifies for the nucleophilic character of the Ru(0)&#8208;BINAP fragment. While being thermally stable, 1 is highly reactive and is capable of activating C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds, and even of cleaving an inert N&#8722;Et bond. The combination of high reactivity and stability originates from the P,arene&#8208;chelation by the BINAP ligand, i.e., the coordinated &#960;&#8208;arene stabilizes Ru(0) to prevent cyclometalation, yet it can slide upon substrate coordination, thereby enabling a variety of inert bond activation reactions to occur under mild conditions.

     alt="Synthesis and Reactivity of Ruthenium(BINAP)(PPh3)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a Ru(0)(BINAP)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) complex (BINAP:2,2&#8242;-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1&#8242;-binaphthyl) is reported. It behaves as a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16-electron Ru(0) complex: while being quite stable, it is capable to substitute PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with alkenes/dienes, and activate C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H or inert N&#8722;Et bonds. This compound gives novel insight into Ru(0) stabilization approaches while maintaining a high specific reactivity potentially useful for catalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ru(BINAP)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)HCl cleanly reacts with LiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TMS to give Ru(BINAP)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) that has been fully characterized, including by X-ray diffraction (BINAP and TMS stand for (2,2&#8242;-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1&#8242;-binaphthyl and trimethylsilyl respectively). In sharp contrast with other carbonyl-free phosphine complexes of Ru(0), &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates a strikingly high thermal stability and no propensity for intramolecular C&#8722;H activation (cyclometalation). Yet &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; coordinates acetonitrile and readily exchanges its PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligand with alkenes and dienes, thus behaving like a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16-e Ru(0) species. Electron-poor alkenes coordinate more readily than electron-rich ones, which testifies for the nucleophilic character of the Ru(0)-BINAP fragment. While being thermally stable, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is highly reactive and is capable of activating C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds, and even of cleaving an inert N&#8722;Et bond. The combination of high reactivity and stability originates from the P,arene-chelation by the BINAP ligand, i.e., the coordinated &#960;-arene stabilizes Ru(0) to prevent cyclometalation, yet it can slide upon substrate coordination, thereby enabling a variety of inert bond activation reactions to occur under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorane&#8208;Promoted C&#8722;C Coupling during Aryne Annulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high potential energy of aryne intermediates can induce reactions that proceed through unorthodox mechanisms. Herein we report the aryne&#8208;promoted formation of various helical dibenzochalcophenes from phosphine chalcogenides. Based on DFT computations we propose a mechanism to account for the final C&#8722;C bond formation that involves a rare, concerted ligand&#8208;coupling event within a hypervalent &#963;&#8208;phosphorane.







Abstract
Arynes are fleeting, high&#8208;energy intermediates that undergo myriad trapping reactions by nucleophiles. Their unusual reactivity compared to other electrophiles can spur unexpected mechanistic pathways enroute to the formation of benzenoid products. Herein we explore a particularly unique case of thermally generated arynes reacting with phosphoranes to form helical dibenzothiophenes and &#8208;selenophenes. Multiple new helical polycyclic aromatic products are reported. DP4+ and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis were used in tandem to confirm the structural topologies of selected products and to demonstrate the utility of DP4+ for distinguishing between isomeric polycyclic aromatic compounds. Lastly, we discuss a plausible mechanism consistent with DFT computations that accounts for the product formation; namely, ligand coupling (i.e., reductive elimination) within a hypervalent, pentacarbon&#8208;ligated &#963;&#8208;phosphorane furnishes the dibenzothio&#8208; or dibenzoselenophene.

         <title>Fundamentals of Unanticipated Efficiency of Gd2O3&#8208;based Catalysts in Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic tests combined with temporal analysis of products revealed the fundamentals relevant for regulating the efficiency of the oxidative coupling of CH4 to C2H6 over Gd&#8208;based catalysts. When Gd2O3 is modified with Na, Sr or Ba, the use of N2O instead of O2 significantly improves the selectivity even at 650&#8201;&#176;C. The promoters affect the binding strength of monoatomic oxygen species derived from N2O and thus control the methane oxidation to carbon oxides.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane/ethylene poses a significant challenge for commercialization. The required improvements are hampered by the uncertainties associated with the reaction mechanism due to its complexity. Herein, we report about 90&#8201;% selectivity to the target products at 11&#8201;% methane conversion over Gd2O3&#8208;based catalysts at 700&#8201;&#176;C using N2O as the oxidant. Sophisticated kinetic studies have suggested the nature of adsorbed oxygen species and their binding strength as key parameters for undesired methane oxidation to carbon oxides. These descriptors can be controlled by a metal oxide promoter for Gd2O3.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Controlled Synthesis of Oriented Quasi&#8208;Spherical CsPbBr3 Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven approach is employed to achieve the controlled synthesis of four types of CsPbBr3 crystals and successfully control the orientation of quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 structures. Synthesis parameters are optimized using high&#8208;throughput characterization combined with machine learning. Furthermore, the synthetic mechanism is determined. Oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, screened by using the data&#8208;driven approach, exhibit significantly improved optical properties.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of lead&#8208;halide perovskite crystals is challenging yet attractive because of the pivotal role played by the crystal structure and growth conditions in regulating their properties. This study introduces data&#8208;driven strategies for the controlled synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, alongside an investigation into the synthesis mechanism. High&#8208;throughput rapid characterization of absorption spectra and color under ultraviolet illumination was conducted using 23 possible ligands for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 crystals. The links between the absorption spectra slope (difference in the absorbance at 400&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm divided by a wavelength interval of 50&#8197;nm) and crystal size were determined through statistical analysis of more than 100 related publications. Big data analysis and machine learning were employed to investigate a total of 688 absorption spectra and 652 color values, revealing correlations between synthesis parameters and properties. Ex situ characterization confirmed successful synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 perovskites using polyvinylpyrrolidone and Acacia. Density functional theory calculations highlighted strong adsorption of Acacia on the (110) facet of CsPbBr3. Optical properties of the oriented quasi&#8208;spherical perovskites prepared with these data&#8208;driven strategies were significantly improved. This study demonstrates that data&#8208;driven controlled synthesis facilitates morphology&#8208;controlled perovskites with excellent optical properties.

         <title>Deoxygenative Coupling of CO with a Tetrametallic Magnesium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in both carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and deoxygenation to generate an acetaldehyde enolate [C2OH3]&#8722; which remains coordinated to the cluster. DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C2O2H3]3&#8722; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.







Abstract
Addition of CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in both carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and deoxygenation to generate an acetaldehyde enolate [C2OH3]&#8722; which remains coordinated to the cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of formation of an isolable complex containing an [C2OH3]&#8722; fragment from reaction of CO with a metal hydride, and the first example of CO homologation and deoxygenation at a main group metal. DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C2O2H3]3&#8722; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.

DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence by Organic Cocrystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a new design strategy to stabilize triplet excitons for high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence by organic cocrystal engineering. The reported cocrystal has an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 2.16&#8197;s, which is the best performance in the case of organic cocrystals under ambient conditions so far.







Abstract
Organic phosphors offer a promising alternative in optoelectronics, but their temperature&#8208;sensitive feature has restricted their applications in high&#8208;temperature scenarios, and the attainment of high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still challenging. Herein, a series of organic cocrystal phosphors are constructed by supramolecular assembly with an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 2.16&#8197;s. Intriguingly, remarkable stabilization of triplet excitons can also be realized at elevated temperature, and green phosphorescence is still exhibited in solid state even up to 150&#8201;&#176;C. From special molecular packing within the crystal lattice, it has been observed that the orientation of isolated water cluster and well&#8208;controlled molecular organization via multiple interactions can favor the structural rigidity of cocrystals more effectively to suppress the nonradiative transition, thus resulting in efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and unprecedented survival of HTP.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Strained meso&#8208;meso&#8208;Linked Porphyrin Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding to a template bends a photonic wire consisting of 18 meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrins into a ring, allowing covalent cyclization by Glaser coupling, to yield a strained nanoring. The 18&#8208;legged template was synthesized efficiently via six&#8208;fold iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation. The nanoring was characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).







Abstract
Strained macrocycles display interesting properties, such as conformational rigidity, often resulting in enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation or enhanced affinity for non&#8208;covalent guest binding, yet they can be difficult to synthesize. Here we use computational modeling to design a template to direct the formation of an 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring with direct meso&#8208;meso bonds between the porphyrin units. Coupling of a linear 18&#8208;porphyrin oligomer in the presence of this template gives the target nanoring, together with an unexpected 36&#8208;porphyrin ring by&#8208;product. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed the elliptical conformations and flexibility of these nanorings on a Au(111) surface.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensionally Extended Metal&#8211;Organic Ladder Compound Exhibiting Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound was reported for the first time. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8722;I&#8722;Pt&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs. The out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs.







Abstract
Ladder systems situated in the dimensional crossover region have attracted much attention because their electronic states and physical properties depend strongly on the electronic correlations among the constituent legs. Generally, two&#8208;/three&#8208;legged transition metal&#8208;oxide ladder compounds are studied as representative ladder systems, but two&#8208;/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) extensions based on such ladder systems with a few numbers of legs are difficult because of the extreme synthesis conditions. Here, for the first time, we report the successful creation of a 3D extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound, [Pt(en)(dpye)I]2(NO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (en=ethylenediamine; dpye=1,2&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane), which is obtained by simple oxidative polymerization of a small Pt macrocyclic complex using elemental I2. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of 1D mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8722;I&#8722;Pt&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering analyses and optical measurements revealed that the out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs. In addition, this compound shows an increase in proton conductivity by a factor of up to 1000, depending on humidity.

         <title>Controllable Double Difluoromethylene Insertions into S&#8722;Cu Bonds: (Arylthio)tetrafluoroethylation of Aryl Iodides with TMSCF2Br</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable double difluoromethylene insertions into S&#8722;Cu bonds have been developed with TMSCF2Br reagent, which provides a general synthetic protocol to contruct ArSCF2CF2Cu intermediates as well as the ArSCF2CF2Ar&#8242; products.







Abstract
A new method of constructing &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; from ArSCu and TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) has been developed. The cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the obtained &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; with diverse aryl iodides (Ar&#8242;I) provide an efficient access to Ar&#8242;CF2CF2SAr. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; species were generated through controllable double difluoromethylene insertions into ArS&#8722;Cu bonds rather than the 1,2&#8208;addition of ArSCu to tetrafluoroethylene.

         <title>Sequential C&#8722;F Bond Transformation of the Difluoromethylene Unit in Perfluoroalkyl Groups: A Combination of Fine&#8208;Tuned Phenothiazine Photoredox Catalyst and Lewis Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
The sequential defluorinative transformation of a difluoromethylene (CF2) unit in perfluoroalkyl compounds has been achieved by a combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis acid activation. A newly developed phenothiazine&#8208;based catalyst served as an efficient catalyst for defluoroaminoxylation. Spectroscopic measurements revealed the reaction mechanism. AlCl3 facilitated further defluorinative transformation of the aminoxylated compounds.







Abstract
A sequential process via photoredox catalysis and Lewis acid mediation for C&#8722;F bond transformation of the CF2 unit in perfluoroalkyl groups has been achieved to transform perfluoroalkylarenes into complex fluoroalkylated compounds. A phenothiazine&#8208;based photocatalyst promotes the defluoroaminoxylation of perfluoroalkylarenes with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) under visible light irradiation, affording the corresponding aminoxylated products. These products undergo a further defluorinative transformation with various organosilicon reagents mediated by AlCl3 to provide highly functionalized perfluoroalkyl alcohols. Our novel phenothiazine catalyst works efficiently in the defluoroaminoxylation. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the catalyst regeneration step is crucial for the photocatalytic aminoxylation.

         <title>Renewing Halogen Substitution Strategy for the Rational Design of High&#8208;Curie Temperature Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, this work renews the halogen substitution strategy to obtain a series of high&#8208;Tc molecular AFEs, which opens up a new pathway to design high&#8208;Tc molecular AFEs and injects new vitalities in the halogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free molecular antiferroelectric (AFE) holds a promise for energy storage on account of its unique physical attributes. However, it is challenging to explore high&#8208;curie temperature (Tc) molecular AFEs, due to the lack of design strategies regarding the rise of phase transition energy barriers. By renewing the halogen substitution strategy, we have obtained a series of high&#8208;Tc molecular AFEs of the halogen&#8208;substituted phenethylammonium bromides (x&#8208;PEAB, x=H/F/Cl/Br), resembling the binary stator&#8208;rotator system. Strikingly, the p&#8208;site halogen substitution of PEA+ cationic rotators raises their phase transition energy barrier and greatly enhances Tc up to ~473&#8197;K for Br&#8208;PEAB, on par with the record&#8208;high Tc values for molecular AFEs. As a typical case, the member 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide (F&#8208;PEAB) shows notable AFE properties, including high Tc (~374&#8197;K) and large electric polarization (~3.2&#8197;&#956;C/cm2). Further, F&#8208;PEAB also exhibits a high energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 83.6&#8201;% even around Tc, catching up with other AFE oxides. This renewing halogen substitution strategy in the molecular AFE system provides an effective way to design high&#8208;Tc AFEs for energy storage devices.

         <title>Incorporation of an Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate into a Thin Film for Choline Recognition in an Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#8216;aniono&#8217; helicates have been formed by the coordination of tetraphenylethene&#8208;decorated anion&#8208;binding ligand with phosphate ions. The triple helicates can be solution&#8208;processed with a polymethyl methacrylate matrix to generate functional thin films with multiple optical properties and used to recognize choline and its derivatives in water.







Abstract
Functional thin films, being fabricated by incorporating discrete supramolecular architectures, have potential applications in research areas such as sensing, energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Here, we have determined that an anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate can be solution&#8208;processed into a functional thin film by incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by the incorporation of the anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate show multiple optical properties, such as fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, the film has the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in a water system. The successful recognition of Ch+ by the film represents the first example of utilizing &#8216;aniono&#8217;&#8208;supramolecular architectures for biomolecule detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.

         <title>Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24&#8212;A Chromium(+IV) Nitridosilicate Phosphate with Amphibole&#8208;Type Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24, the first nitridic analog to amphibole minerals, was obtained at high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The structure was elucidated by microfocused synchrotron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and magnetic measurements, which were able to prove the partial disorder of Si and Cr and the oxidation state +IV of chromium.







Abstract
The first nitridic analog of an amphibole mineral, the quaternary nitridosilicate phosphate Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400&#8201;&#176;C and 12&#8197;GPa from the binary nitrides Cr2N, Si3N4 and P3N5, using NH4N3 and NH4F as additional nitrogen source and mineralizing agent, respectively. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation (C2/m, a=9.6002(19), b=17.107(3), c=4.8530(10)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=109.65(3)&#176;). The elemental composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The structure consists of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming zweier double chains and edge&#8208;sharing (Si,Cr)&#8208;centered octahedra forming separated ribbons. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy shows ordered Si and Cr sites next to a disordered Si/Cr site. Optical spectroscopy indicates a band gap of 2.1&#8197;eV. Susceptibility measurements show paramagnetic behavior and support the oxidation state Cr+IV, which is confirmed by EPR. The comprehensive analysis expands the field of Cr&#8722;N chemistry and provides access to a nitride analog of one of the most prevalent silicate structures.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Spontaneous Electropolymerization Enables Robust Hydrogel Electrolyte Interfaces in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels hold great promise as electrolytes for emerging aqueous batteries, for which establishing a robust electrode&#8208;hydrogel interface is crucial for mitigating side reactions. Conventional hydrogel electrolytes fabricated by ex&#8208;situ polymerization through either thermal stimulation or photo exposure cannot ensure complete interfacial contact with electrodes. Herein, we introduce an in&#8208;situ electropolymerization approach for constructing hydrogel electrolytes. The hydrogel is spontaneously generated during the initial cycling of the battery, eliminating the need of additional initiators for polymerization. The involvement of electrodes during the hydrogel synthesis yields well&#8208;bonded and deep infiltrated electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. As a case study, we attest that, the in&#8208;situ formed polyanionic hydrogel in Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery substantially improves the stability and kinetics of both Zn anode and porous MnO2 cathode owing to the robust interfaces. This research provides insight to the function of hydrogel electrolyte interfaces and constitute a critical advancement in designing highly durable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Volume Expansion of Micron&#8208;Sized SiOx via Closed&#8208;Nanopore Structure Constructed by Mg&#8208;Induced Elemental Segregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherently huge volume expansion during Li uptake have hindered the use of Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. While some pore&#8208;forming and nano&#8208;architecting strategies show promises to effectively buffer the volume change, other parameters essential for practical electrode fabrication, such as compaction density, are often compromised. Here we propose a new in&#8208;situ Mg doping strategy to form closed&#8208;nanopore structure into a micron&#8208;sized SiOx particle at a high bulk density. The doped Mg atoms promote the segregation of O, so that high&#8208;density magnesium silicates form to generate closed nanopores. By altering the mass content of Mg dopant, the average radius (ranged from 5.4 to 9.7 nm) and porosity (ranged from 1.4% to 15.9%) of the closed pore is precisely adjustable, which accounts for volume expansion of SiOx from 77.8% to 22.2% at the minimum. Benefited from the small volume variation, the Mg&#8208;doped micron&#8208;SiOx anode demonstrate improved Li storage performance towards realization of a 700&#8208;(dis)charge&#8208;cycle, 11&#8208;Ah&#8208;pouch&#8208;type cell at a capacity retention of &gt;80%. This work offers insights into reasonable design of the internal structure of micron&#8208;sized SiOx and other materials that undergo conversion or alloying reactions with drastic volume change, to enable high&#8208;energy batteries with stable electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Zigzag Hopping Site Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Coating for Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise design and tuning of Zn hopping/transfer sites with deeper understanding of the dendrite&#8208;formation mechanism is vital in artificial anode protective coating for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, we probe into the role of anode&#8208;coating interfaces by designing a series of anhydride&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (i.e., PI&#8208;DP&#8208;COF and PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) with specifically designed zigzag hopping sites and zincophilic anhydride groups that can serve as desired platforms to investigate the related Zn2+ hopping/transfer behaviours as well as the interfacial interaction. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, the ABC stacking models of these COFs endow the structures with specific zigzag sites along the 1D channel that can accelerate Zn2+ transfer kinetics, lower surface&#8208;energy, homogenize ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed. Attributed to these superiorities, thus&#8208;obtained optimal PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF cells offer excellent cycling lifespan in both symmetric&#8208;cell (2000 cycles at 60 mA cm&#8208;2) and full&#8208;cell (1600 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1), outperforming almost all the reported porous crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Strained Amino Acids by a PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme through Cryptic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acids (AAs) are modular building blocks which nature uses to synthesize both macromolecules, such as proteins, and small molecule natural products, such as alkaloids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides. While the 20 main proteinogenic AAs display relatively limited side chain diversity, a wide range of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) exist that are not used by the ribosome for protein synthesis, but contain a broad array of structural features and functional groups. In this communication, we report the discovery of the biosynthetic pathway for a new ncAA, pazamine, which contains a cyclopropane ring formed in two steps. In the first step, a chlorine is added onto the C4 position of lysine by a radical halogenase, PazA. The cyclopropane ring is then formed in the next step by a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme, PazB, via an SN2&#8208;like attack at C4 to eliminate chloride. Genetic studies of this pathway in the native host, Pseudomonas azotoformans,&#160; show that pazamine potentially inhibits ethylene biosynthesis in growing plants based on alterations in the root phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We further show that PazB can be utilized to make an alternative cyclobutane&#8208;containing AA. These discoveries may lead to advances in biocatalytic production of specialty chemicals and agricultural biotechnology.</dc:description>

The electrochemical potentials of [Cr(LMes)3] are more negative than those of [Ir(ppy)3] and render the [Cr(LMes)3]* excited state inaccessible through conventional co&#8208;reactant ECL with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine or oxalate. ECL can be obtained, however, through the annihilation route in which potentials sufficient to oxidise and reduce the luminophore are alternately applied. When combined with [Ir(ppy)3] (&#955;em = 520 nm), the annihilation ECL of [Cr(LMes)3] was greatly enhanced whereas that of [Ir(ppy)3] was diminished. Under appropriate conditions, the relative intensities of the two spectrally distinct emissions can be controlled through the applied potentials. From this starting point for ECL with 3d6 metal complexes, we discuss some directions for future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Electro/Ni Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Carboxylates and Aryl Bromide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paired redox&#8208;neutral electrolysis offers an attractive green platform for organic synthesis by avoiding sacrificial oxidants and reductants. Carboxylates are non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive, and widely available, making them ideal nucleophiles for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here, we report the electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of pristine carboxylates with aryl bromides. At a cathode, a NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate is formed through the activation of Ar&#8722;Br bond by a NiI&#8208;bipyridine catalyst and subsequent reduction. At an anode, the carboxylates, including amino acid, benzyl carboxylic acid, and 2&#8208;phenoxy propionic acid, undergo oxidative decarboxylation to form carbon&#8208;based free radicals. The combination of NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate and carbon radical results in the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling products. The adaptation of this electrosynthesis method to flow synthesis and valuable molecule synthesis was demonstrated. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied through electrochemical voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies. The relationships between the electrochemical properties of carboxylates and the reaction selectivity were revealed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions described herein expand the chemical space of paired electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling and represent a promising method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds because of the ubiquitous carboxylate nucleophiles and the innate scalability and flexibility of electrochemical flow&#8208;synthesis technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Na2C3O2: the first crystalline compound with the elusive &#8211;C&#926;C&#8208;COO&#8211; anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By reaction of sodium electride or NaC2H with the anhydrous sodium salt of propiolic acid, Na(OOC&#8208;C&#926;C&#8208;H), in liquid ammonia crystalline powders of Na2C3O2 were obtained. The structure analysis based on synchrotron powder diffraction data revealed that Na2C3O2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (I2/a, Z&#160;=&#160;4) exhibiting the elusive Y&#8208;shaped&#8211;C&#926;C&#8208;COO&#8211; anion, which is unprecedented in a crystalline compound up to now. IR/Raman and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic investigations with assignments supported by DFT&#8208;based ab initio calculations confirm this finding. Reaction with sodium electride led to a higher crystallinity of the product, but additionally a by&#8208;product apparently due to decomposition and polymerization of Na2C3O2 was formed. No such by&#8208;product was observed in the reaction with NaC2H, which turned out to be a milder metalation route. However, the product of the latter reaction is less crystalline.</dc:description>

         <title>Stiffness modulation and pulsatile release in dual responsive hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by nature, self&#8208;regulation can be introduced in synthetic hydrogels by incorporating chemo&#8208;mechanical signals or coupled chemical reactions to maintain or adapt the material&#8217;s physio&#8208;chemical properties when exposed to external triggers. In this work, we present redox and light dual stimuli responsive hydrogels capable of rapidly adapting the polymer crosslinking network while maintaining hydrogel stability. Upon irradiation with UV light, polymer hydrogels containing redox responsive disulfide crosslinks and light responsive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties show a release of payload accompanied by adaptation of the hydrogel network towards higher stiffness due to in situ crosslinking by S&#8208;nitrosylation. Whereas the hydrogel design allows the network to either become softer in presence of reducing agent glutathione or stiffer upon UV irradiation, simultaneous application of both stimuli induces network self&#8208;regulation resulting in a pulsatile form of payload release from the hydrogel. Finally, adaptive stiffness was used to make tunable hydrogels as substrates for different cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Chirality in Canthaxanthin Aggregates Reveals Multiple Levels of Supramolecular Organization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carotenoids tend to form supramolecular aggregates via non&#8208;covalent interactions where the chirality of individual molecules is amplified to the macroscopic level. We show that this can also be achieved for non&#8208;chiral carotenoid monomers interacting with polysaccharides. The chirality induction in canthaxanthin (CAX), caused by heparin (HP) and hyaluronic acid (HA), was monitored by chiroptical spectroscopy. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra indicated the presence of multiple carotenoid formations, such as H&#8208; and J&#8208;type aggregates. This is consistent with molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations of the supramolecular structures and their spectroscopic response.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) has been hindered by limited cycle&#8208;life and safety concerns. To solve these problems, we develop a novel fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linker for gel polymer electrolyte in high&#8208;voltage LMBs, achieving superior electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously. The fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) by in&#8208;situ polymerization method not only demonstrates high oxidation stability but also exhibits excellent compatibility with lithium metal anode. LMBs utilizing FP&#8208;GPE realize stable cycling even at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V (vs Li/Li+) with various high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2|FP&#8208;GPE|Li battery exhibits an ultralong cycle&#8208;life of 1200 cycles with an impressive capacity retention of 80.1%. Furthermore, the FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance even at practical conditions, such as high cathode mass loading (20.84 mg cm&#8722;2), ultrathin Li (20 &#956;m), and a wide temperature range of &#8722;25 to 80 &#8451;. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse. Additionally, the industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical LiMn2O4|FP&#8208;GPE|Li4Ti5O12 cells demonstrate a remarkable cycle&#8208;life of 1400 cycles. Therefore, the impressive electrochemical performance and high safety in practical batteries demonstrate a substantial potential of well&#8208;designed FP&#8208;GPE for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Polymer Chiral Co&#8208;assembly and Contactless Dynamic Chiral Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise modulation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) including formulated color coordinates and handedness is realized by quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of three similar fluorene&#8208;based polymers with distinct fluorescence, directed by the addition principle. Furthermore, a contactless chiral communication with azobenzene&#8208;containing polymer (PAzo), which is a reverse subtraction principle, is used to achieve dynamic switch of CPL.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays a pivotal role in cutting&#8208;edge display and information technologies. Currently achieving precise color control and dynamic signal regulation in CPL still remains challenging due to the elusory relationship between fluorescence and chirality.

&lt;p&gt;Precise modulation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) including formulated color coordinates and handedness is realized by quantitative supramolecular co-assembly of three similar fluorene-based polymers with distinct fluorescence, directed by the &lt;i&gt;addition principle&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, a contactless chiral communication with azobenzene-containing polymer (PAzo), which is a reverse &lt;i&gt;subtraction principle&lt;/i&gt;, is used to achieve dynamic switch of CPL.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays a pivotal role in cutting-edge display and information technologies. Currently achieving precise color control and dynamic signal regulation in CPL still remains challenging due to the elusory relationship between fluorescence and chirality. Inspired by the natural mechanisms governing color formation and chiral interaction, we proposed an &lt;i&gt;addition-subtraction principle&lt;/i&gt; theory to address this issue. Three fluorene-based polymers synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation with different electron-deficient monomers exhibit similar structures and UV/Vis absorption, but distinct fluorescence emissions due to intramolecular charge transfer. Based on this, precise-color CPL-active films are obtained through quantitative supramolecular co-assembly directed by &lt;i&gt;addition principle&lt;/i&gt;. Particularly, an ideal white-emitting CPL film (CIE coordinates: (0.33, 0.33)) is facilely fabricated with a high quantum yield of 80.8&#8201;% and a dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Structural analysis reveals that the ordered stacking orientation favors higher &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;.

The representative system consisting of as-prepared fluorene-based polymers and chirality-selective absorption azobenzene (Azo)-containing polymers is constructed, achieving CPL weakening, reversal, and enhancement.

         <title>A Versatile Thioesterase Involved in Dimerization during Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile &#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) ysfF encodes YsfF and a nested YsfFHBT. The 4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme domain in YsfF and YsfFHBT could accomplish the ring&#8208;closure reaction for benzyl ring formation. Notably, YsfF and YsfX together are responsible for ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatizing dimerization. Furthermore, Asn301, Glu483, and His566 were found to be active&#8208;site residues for both activities.







Abstract
The cinnamoyl lipid compound youssoufene A1 (1), featuring a unique dearomatic carbon&#8208;bridged dimeric skeleton, exhibits increased inhibition against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis as compared to monomeric youssoufenes. However, the formation process of this intriguing dearomatization/dimerization remains unknown. In this study, an unusual &#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) gene ysfF was functionally characterized. The gene was found to naturally encodes two proteins, an entire YsfF with &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase (4&#8208;HBT)&#8208;like enzyme domains, and a nested YsfFHBT (4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme). Using an intracellular tagged carrier&#8208;protein tracking (ITCT) strategy, in vitro reconstitution and in vivo experiments, we found that: i) both domains of YsfF displayed thioesterase activities; ii) YsfF/YsfFHBT could accomplish the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure for benzene ring formation; and iii) YsfF and cyclase YsfX together were responsible for the ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatization/dimerization process, possibly through an unprecedented Michael&#8208;type addition reaction. Moreover, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that N301, E483 and H566 of YsfF are critical residues for both the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and dimerization processes. This study enhances our understanding of the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Low Crystallinity for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with low crystallinity has been synthesized that has a high power factor of up to 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in solution&#8208;processed flexible organic thermoelectrics. The flexible devices also show good resistance to bending strain, with only marginal changes in the electrical conductivity after 600 bending cycles.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low crystallinity are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures of these CPs can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. However, n&#8208;doped CPs usually exhibit poor thermoelectric performance, which hinders the development of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n&#8208;type CP (ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz) comprising two acceptor units: a thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and a cyano&#8208;functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz shows a low LUMO energy level of below &#8722;4.20&#8197;eV and features low crystallinity, enabling high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual&#8208;acceptor design enhances polaron delocalization, resulting in good thermoelectric performance. After n&#8208;doping, ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits an average electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 50.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor (PF) of 126.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, which is among the highest values reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type CPs to date. Additionally, a solution&#8208;processed flexible OTE device based on doped ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits a maximum PF of 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2; the flexible device also shows remarkable resistance to bending strain, with only a marginal change in &#963; after 600 bending cycles. The findings presented in this work will advance the development of n&#8208;type CPs for OTE devices, and flexible devices in particular.

Abstract
Recently, Huo et&#8197;al. has commented on our communication (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312, DOI: 10.1002/anie.202317312), regarding the multireference character (MRC) of our proposed cluster. Their argument is based on small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, fractional occupation density (FOD) and CASPT2(12,13) calculations. They also proposed that the singlet planar In4H+ cluster cannot be observed. We present our calculations which reveals that some of their arguments are based on wrong interpretation of data and inadequate use of methodology. While we certainly agree with the strong physical ground of FOD, CASSF and CASPT2 methodology, we believe that such analysis for clusters is not adequate.

         <title>Li+ Cations Activate NiFeOOH for Oxygen Evolution in Sodium and Potassium Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction on NiFeOOH has a known activity dependence on the electrolyte composition: CsOH&gt;Na/KOH&gt;LiOH. Here, we show that addition of LiOH to NaOH at constant pH results in improved OER rates due to mitigation of non&#8208;kinetic effects. We show that this is due increased intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide into the layered material in the presence of Li+.







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolysis is reduced due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides catalyst properties, electrocatalytic activity also depends on the interaction of the electrocatalyst with the electrolyte. Here, we show that the addition of small amounts of Li+ to Fe&#8208;free NaOH or KOH electrolytes activates NiFeOOH for the OER compared to single&#8208;cation electrolytes. Moreover, the activation was maintained when the solution was returned to pure NaOH. Importantly, we show that the origin of activation by Li+ cations is primarily non&#8208;kinetic in nature, as the OER onset for the mixed electrolyte does not change and the Tafel slope at low current density is ~30&#8197;mV/dec in both electrolytes. However, the increase of the apparent Tafel slope remains lower at increasing current densities in the presence of Li+. Based on electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we show that this reduction of non&#8208;kinetic effects is due to enhanced intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide. This enhanced electrolyte penetration facilitates the OER, especially at higher current densities and for increased catalyst loading.

     alt="Li+ Cations Activate NiFeOOH for Oxygen Evolution in Sodium and Potassium Hydroxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction on NiFeOOH has a known activity dependence on the electrolyte composition: CsOH&amp;gt;Na/KOH&amp;gt;LiOH. Here, we show that addition of LiOH to NaOH at constant pH results in improved OER rates due to mitigation of non-kinetic effects. We show that this is due increased intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide into the layered material in the presence of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of electrolysis is reduced due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides catalyst properties, electrocatalytic activity also depends on the interaction of the electrocatalyst with the electrolyte. Here, we show that the addition of small amounts of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe-free NaOH or KOH electrolytes activates NiFeOOH for the OER compared to single-cation electrolytes. Moreover, the activation was maintained when the solution was returned to pure NaOH. Importantly, we show that the origin of activation by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations is primarily non-kinetic in nature, as the OER onset for the mixed electrolyte does not change and the Tafel slope at low current density is ~30&#8197;mV/dec in both electrolytes. However, the increase of the apparent Tafel slope remains lower at increasing current densities in the presence of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we show that this reduction of non-kinetic effects is due to enhanced intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide. This enhanced electrolyte penetration facilitates the OER, especially at higher current densities and for increased catalyst loading. Our work shows that mixed electrolytes where distinct cations can have different roles provide a simple and promising strategy towards improved OER rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Triply&#8208;Periodic&#8208;Minimal&#8208;Surface Structured Interphase based on Fluorinated Polymers Strengthening High&#8208;energy Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we pioneer the incorporation of Triple Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures into lithium battery designs, successfully aligning safety with energy density&#8208;crucial for advanced electric vehicles. Leveraging the biomimetic design inspired by sea urchin skeletons, TPMS enhances Li+ conductivity and mechanical robustness, curtailing dendrite growth and intrusion. Employing a LiFePO4 cathode at a low N/P ratio of ~3, our approach yields a remarkably low capacity fade rate of just 0.002&#8201;% per cycle at a 1&#8197;C rate. Furthermore, TPMS&#8242;s efficient structure halves the interfacial layer&#8216;s mass, substantially elevating the battery&#8216;s energy density. This innovation offers a viable, scalable strategy to overcome the historical trade&#8208;off between battery safety and energy density.







Abstract
The challenge of constructing a mechanically robust yet lightweight artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on lithium (Li) anodes highlights a trade&#8208;off between high battery safety and high energy density. Inspired by the intricate microstructure of the white sea urchin, we first develop a polyvinyl fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) interfacial layer with a triple periodic minimal surface structure (TPMS) that could offer maximal modulus with minimal weight. This design endows high mechanical strength to an ordered porous structure, effectively reduces local current density, polarization, and internal resistance, and stabilizes the anode interface. At a low N/P ratio of ~3, using LiFePO4 as the cathode, Li anodes protected by TPMS&#8208;structured PVDF&#8208;HFP achieve an extremely low capacity&#8208;fading&#8208;rate of approximately 0.002&#8201;% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1&#8197;C, with an average discharge capacity of 142&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the TPMS porous structure saves 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the interfacial layer mass, thereby enhancing the energy density of the battery. The TPMS structure is conducive to large&#8208;scale additive manufacturing, which will provide a reference for the future development of lightweight, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density secondary batteries.

         <title>Unique Double and Triple Decker Arrangements of Rare&#8208;Earth 9,10&#8208;Diborataanthracene Complexes Featuring Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring diborataanthracene ligands are showcased. These are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere.







Abstract
Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring a 9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene ligand. This 14&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron ligand is highly reductive and was previously used in small&#8208;molecule activation. Salt elimination reactions between dipotassium 9,10&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] (CotTIPS=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H6) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio yielded heteroleptic sandwich complexes [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). These compounds form Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;free one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers when crystallised from toluene. In contrast, reaction of [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio led to the formation of heteroleptic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). Notably, these are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first trivalent lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere. Magnetic investigations reveal that [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln=Dy, Er) and [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)ErIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)ErIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] exhibit Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour. In the case of [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln=Dy, Er), the introduction of a second near lanthanide ion results in strong antiferromagnetic interactions, allowing the enhancement of the magnetic characteristic of the system, compared to the quasi isolated counterpart. This research renews the overlooked coordination chemistry of the DBA ligand and expands it to encompass rare&#8208;earth elements.

         <title>Functionalized Phenanthrene Imide&#8208;Based Polymers for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenanthrene (PhA)&#8208;based electron&#8208;deficient moieties were developed and dual functionalization strategy was utilized to fine&#8208;tune the molecular lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The synergetic effects from imide and carbonyl or cyano (CN) groups gift these moieties suitable solubility and stabilized LUMOs. The CN&#8208;containing imide obtains a stronger electron&#8208;deficiency and its derivative polymer can achieve higher electron mobility under a lower voltage in transistors.







Abstract
High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymers are crucial for the advance of organic electronics field, however strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties for constructing them are still limited. The imide&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, high electron deficiency and good solubility serve as promising candidates for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers. Among the PAHs, phenanthrene (PhA) features a well&#8208;delocalized aromatic &#960;&#8208;system with multiple modifiable active sites . However, the PhA&#8208;based imides are seldom studied, mainly attributed to the synthetic challenge. Herein, we report two functionalized PhAs, CPOI and CPCNI, by simultaneously incorporating imide with carbonyl or dicyanomethylene onto PhA. Notably, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;modified CPCNI exhibits a well stabilized LUMO energy level (&#8722;3.84&#8197;eV), attributed to the synergetic inductive effect from imide and cyano groups. Subsequently, based on CPOI and CPCNI, two polymers PCPOI&#8208;Tz and PCPCNI&#8208;Tz were developed. Applied to organic thin&#8208;film transistors, owing to the strong electron&#8208;deficiency of CPCNI, polymer PCPCNI&#8208;Tz shows an improved electron mobility and largely decreased threshold voltage compared with PCPOI&#8208;Tz. This work affords two structurally novel electron&#8208;deficient building blocks and highlights the effectiveness of dual functionalization of PhAs with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for devising n&#8208;type polymers.

         <title>Fused Azulenyl Squaraine Derivatives Improve Phototheranostics in the Second Near&#8208;Infrared Window by Concentrating Excited State Energy on Non&#8208;Radiative Decay Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PS&#8208;1 nanoparticles based on fused azulenyl squaraine derivatives exhibit remarkable second near&#8208;infrared phototheranostic performance by allowing almost all excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways. Additionally, long&#8208;wavelength light harvesting capability also increases due to J aggregation. Finally, the potential of PS&#8208;1 nanoparticles for treating deep&#8208;seated cancer and root canal infection were demonstrated.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) theranostics offer new opportunities for precise disease phototheranostic due to the enhanced tissue penetration and higher maximum permissible exposure of NIR&#8208;II light. However, traditional regimens lacking effective NIR&#8208;II absorption and uncontrollable excited&#8208;state energy decay pathways often result in insufficient theranostic outcomes. Herein a phototheranostic nano&#8208;agent (PS&#8208;1 NPs) based on azulenyl squaraine derivatives with a strong NIR&#8208;II absorption band centered at 1092&#8197;nm is reported, allowing almost all absorbed excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, leading to high photothermal conversion efficiency (90.98&#8201;%) and strong photoacoustic response. Both in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic/photothermal therapy results demonstrate enhanced deep tissue cancer theranostic performance of PS&#8208;1 NPs. Even in the 5&#8197;mm deep&#8208;seated tumor model, PS&#8208;1 NPs demonstrated a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor effect in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, for the human extracted tooth root canal infection model, the synergistic outcomes of the photothermal effect of PS&#8208;1 NPs and 0.5&#8201;% NaClO solution resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to the clinical gold standard irrigation agent 5.25&#8201;% NaClO, opening up possibilities for the expansion of NIR&#8208;II theranostic agents in oral medicine.

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Anode/Electrolyte Interfaces Coupled with Regulated Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Term and Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic anode/electrolyte interface coupled with regulated solvation structures strategy is firstly realized with Tris additive for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract solvated&#8208;Zn2+, then promote the de&#8208;solvation by the orientation polarization, the volume rejection effect and strong intermolecular force of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris, leading to an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport kinetics and the inhibition of side reactions.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) show a great potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their high safety and high energy density. However, the severe side reactions of zinc negative electrode largely hinder the further application of AZIBs. Herein, trace tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) additive with rich lone&#8208;pair&#8208;electrons and zincophilic sites is firstly introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, Tris not only regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, but is also adsorbed vertically on the Zn anode surface with a changed coordination intensity during the plating/stripping process of Zn to generate an in situ dynamic adsorption layer for the first time. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract the solvated Zn2+ and then promote the de&#8208;solvation of the solvated Zn2+ owing to the orientation polarization with regularly&#8208;changed applied electric field, the volume rejection effect, and strong intermolecular force towards H2O of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris. Therefore, an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport kinetics as well as the inhibition of side reactions of Zn anode are successfully realized. Accordingly, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell provides an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 2600&#8197;h. Furthermore, the Zn||MnO2 full cell with Tris could demonstrate a high capacity and structural stability for practical applications.

         <title>Synthetic Genes For Dynamic Regulation Of DNA&#8208;Based Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a general strategy that uses synthetic genes encoding for RNA effector strands that, by binding to a synthetic DNA ligand&#8208;binding receptor can induce the release or the loading of a molecular ligand.







Abstract
We present a strategy to control dynamically the loading and release of molecular ligands from synthetic nucleic acid receptors using in vitro transcription. We demonstrate this by engineering three model synthetic DNA&#8208;based receptors: a triplex&#8208;forming DNA complex, an ATP&#8208;binding aptamer, and a hairpin strand, whose ability to bind their specific ligands can be cotranscriptionally regulated (activated or inhibited) through specific RNA molecules produced by rationally designed synthetic genes. The kinetics of our DNA sensors and their genetically generated inputs can be captured using differential equation models, corroborating the predictability of the approach used. This approach shows that highly programmable nucleic acid receptors can be controlled with molecular instructions provided by dynamic transcriptional systems, illustrating their promise in the context of coupling DNA nanotechnology with biological signaling.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Heterocycles via Cycloisomerization of Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208; nucleophiles is reported. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
We report a general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates ethers, esters, protected amines, acetals, pyrazoles, carbamates, and arenes. It is amenable to N&#8208;, O&#8208;, as well as C&#8208;nucleophiles, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversification and synthesis of several small natural products.

         <title>A Universal and Programmable Platform based on Fluorescent Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Probes for Detection of Proteins in Organelles of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal detection platform based on the peptide&#8208;conjugated probes (PCPs, name as TP&#8208;TPE&#8208;TO) by integrating protein recognition units, signal units, and particularly introducing organelle targeting units. The universal detection platform can achieve six protein analysis in three different organelles through simple transformation of recognition units and targeting units.







Abstract
Realizing protein analysis in organelles of living cells is of great significance for developing diagnostic and therapeutic methods of diseases. Fluorescent&#8208;labeled antibodies with well imaging performance and high affinity are classical biochemical tools for protein analysis, while due to the inability to effectively enter into cells, not to mention organelles and the uncontrollable reaction sites that might cause antibodies inactivation when chemically modification, they are hard to apply to living cells. Inspired by the structure of fluorescent&#8208;labeled antibodies, we designed as a universal detection platform that was based on the peptide&#8208;conjugated probes (PCPs) and consisted of three parts: a)&#8197;a rotor type fluorescent molecular scaffold for conjugation and signal output; b)&#8197;the cell penetration protein recognition unit; c)&#8197;the subcellular organelle targeting unit. In living cells, PCPs could firstly localize at organelles and then proceed protein specific recognition, thus jointly leading to the restriction of twisted intramolecular charge transfer and activation of fluorescence signal. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, six different proteins in three typical intracellular organelles could be detected by our platform through simply replacing the recognition sequence of proteins and matching organelle targeting units. The position and intensity of fluorescence signals demonstrated specificity of PCPs and universality of the platform.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Donating Conjugation Effect Modulated Zn2+ Reduction Reaction for Separator&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interphase engineering still requires a thick separator (i.e. glass fiber, 250&#8211;700&#8197;&#956;m) to resist the puncture of inevitable dendrites, which prejudices the energy density of an aqueous battery. We pivot from the traditional interphase plus extra separator categories, proposing an all&#8208;in&#8208;one ligand buffer layer (ca. 20&#8197;&#956;m) to modulate the Zn2+ transfer and deposition behaviors effectively. The catechol groups of the buffer layer can also accelerate the Zn2+ reduction reaction based on their electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;&#960; conjugation effect, decreasing the negative charge in the coordination environment.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) are attracting extensive attention due to the low cost, high capacity, and environmental benignity of the zinc anode. However, their application is still hindered by the undesired zinc dendrites. Despite Zn&#8208;surface modification being promising in relieving dendrites, a thick separator (i.e. glass fiber, 250&#8211;700&#8197;&#956;m) is still required to resist the dendrite puncture, which limits volumetric energy density of battery. Here, we pivot from the traditional interphase plus extra separator categories, proposing an all&#8208;in&#8208;one ligand buffer layer (ca. 20&#8197;&#956;m) to effectively modulate the Zn2+ transfer and deposition behaviors proved by in situ electrochemical digital holography. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory simulations further reveal that the catechol groups in the buffer layer can accelerate the Zn2+ reduction reaction (ZRR) through the electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;&#960; conjugation effect, decreasing the negative charge in the coordination environment. Without extra separators, the elaborated system endows low polarization below 28.2&#8197;mV, long lifespan of 4950&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric batteries, and an unprecedented volumetric energy density of 99.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 based on the whole pouch cells. The concomitantly &#8220;separator&#8208;free&#8221; and &#8220;dendrite&#8208;free&#8221; conjugation effect with an accelerated ZRR process could foster the progression of metallic anodes and benefit energetic aqueous batteries.

         <title>Modular Weaving DNAzyme in Skeleton of DNA Nanocages for Photoactivatable Catalytic Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach is established for spatiotemporal control of DNAzyme&#8208;based gene regulation activity through modular weaving active DNAzyme into skeleton of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (TDN). The direct encoding of DNAzyme in TDN not only improves biostability and delivery efficiency, but also allows spatiotemporal control of their catalytic activity.







Abstract
DNAzymes exhibit tremendous application potentials in the field of biosensing and gene regulation due to its unique catalytic function. However, spatiotemporally controlled regulation of DNAzyme activity remains a daunting challenge, which may cause nonspecific signal leakage or gene silencing of the catalytic systems. Here, we report a photochemical approach via modular weaving active DNAzyme into the skeleton of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (TDN) for light&#8208;triggered on&#8208;demand liberation of DNAzyme and thus conditional control of gene regulation activity. We demonstrate that the direct encoding of DNAzyme in TDN could improve the biostability of DNAzyme and ensure the delivery efficiency, comparing with the conventional surface anchoring strategy. Furthermore, the molecular weaving of the DNA nanostructures allows remote control of DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene regulation with high spatiotemporal precision of light. In addition, we demonstrate that the approach is applicable for controlled regulation of the gene editing functions of other functional nucleic acids.

         <title>Fabrication of Self&#8208;Expanding Metal&#8211;Organic Cages Using a Ring&#8208;Openable Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The framework of a metal&#8211;organic cage can be expanded drastically with its topology retained (self&#8208;expansion). A rigid RhII6 cage with an oligomer&#8208;functionalized, stilbene&#8208;type dicarboxylic ligand transformed into a flexible cage upon cleavage of C=C double bond and simultaneous ring&#8208;opening. The dramatic increase in the cavity size enabled the effective trapping of multidentate N&#8208;donor guest molecules.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), which are formed via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, are being extensively developed for various applications owing to the utility of their accessible molecular&#8208;sized cavity. While MOC structures are uniquely and precisely predetermined by the metal coordination number and ligand configuration, tailoring MOCs to further modulate the size, shape, and chemical environment of the cavities has become intensively studied for a more efficient and adaptive molecular binding. Herein, we report self&#8208;expanding MOCs that exhibit remarkable structural variations in cage size and flexibility while maintaining their topology. A cyclic ligand with an oligomeric chain tethering the two benzene rings of stilbene was designed and mixed with RhII ions to obtain the parent MOCs. These MOCs were successfully transformed into expanded MOCs via the selective cleavage of the double bond in stilbene. The expanded MOCs could effectively trap multidentate N&#8208;donor molecules in their enlarged cavity, in contrast to the original MOCs with a narrow cavity. As the direct synthesis of expanded MOCs is impractical because of the entropically disfavored structures, self&#8208;expansion using ring&#8208;openable ligands is a promising approach that allows precision engineering and the production of functional MOCs that would otherwise be inaccessible.

         <title>CO Cofeeding Affects Product Distribution in CH3Cl Coupling over ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite: Pressure Twists the Plot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of oxygenate co&#8208;feeding presents intriguing prospects to manipulate reactivity patterns and catalyst stability in the conversion of methyl chloride to hydrocarbons over zeolite catalysts. CO&#8208;cofeeding induces a Koch carbonylation path as revealed through detection of the reactive intermediate ketene via operando PEPICO spectroscopy, boosting olefin selectivity at low pressure. Extrapolation to more easily activated CH3OH extends the catalyst lifetime under ambient pressure conditions.







Abstract
C1 coupling reactions over zeolite catalysts are central to sustainable chemical production strategies. However, questions persist regarding the involvement of CO in ketene formation, and the impact of this elusive oxygenate intermediate on reactivity patterns. Using operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), we investigate the role of CO in methyl chloride conversion to hydrocarbons (MCTH), a prospective process for methane valorization with a reaction network akin to methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) but without oxygenate intermediates. Our findings reveal the transformative role of CO in MCTH at the low pressures, inducing ketene formation in MCTH and boosting olefin production, confirming the Koch carbonylation step in the initial stages of C1 coupling. We uncover pressure&#8208;dependent product distributions driven by CO&#8208;induced ketene formation, and its subsequent desorption from the zeolite surface, which is enhanced at low pressure. Inspired by the above results, extension of the co&#8208;feeding approach to CH3OH as another simple oxygenate showcases the additional potential for improved catalyst stability in MCTH at ambient pressure.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lobatamides A and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lobatamides are the most complex salicylate enamide natural products known and are expected to be a new class of antitumor agents through V&#8208;ATPase inhibition. The instability of the &#946;&#8208;salicyloxy ester has prevented the late&#8208;stage installation of the enamide side chains, which play a crucial role in the biological activity. Now a common bislactone intermediate has been used for the total synthesis of lobatamides A and C.







Abstract
The total synthesis of lobatamides A (1&#8201;a) and C (1&#8201;c) via a common bislactone intermediate is reported. The allylic aryl moiety including a trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin was constructed by hydroboration of a 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allene and subsequent Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille coupling. Although the seco acid proved to be highly unstable even in the presence of weak bases, Zhao macrolactonization under acidic conditions via the &#945;&#8208;acyloxyenamide successfully provided the common bislactone intermediate. Hydrozirconation&#8208;iodination of the terminal alkyne and subsequent copper&#8208;mediated coupling with primary amides proceeded successfully in the presence of the sensitive bislactone framework. The developed synthetic route enables the late&#8208;stage installation of enamide side chains, which are crucial structures for V&#8208;ATPase inhibition.

&lt;p&gt;The total synthesis of lobatamides A (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and C (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;) via a common bislactone intermediate is reported. The allylic aryl moiety including a trisubstituted &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-olefin was constructed by hydroboration of a 1,1-disubstituted allene and subsequent Migita-Kosugi-Stille coupling. Although the seco acid proved to be highly unstable even in the presence of weak bases, Zhao macrolactonization under acidic conditions via the &#945;-acyloxyenamide successfully provided the common bislactone intermediate. Hydrozirconation-iodination of the terminal alkyne and subsequent copper-mediated coupling with primary amides proceeded successfully in the presence of the sensitive bislactone framework. The developed synthetic route enables the late-stage installation of enamide side chains, which are crucial structures for V-ATPase inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclopropenes as Chemical Reporters for Dual Bioorthogonal and Orthogonal Metabolic Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual bioorthogonal labeling enables the investigation and understanding of interactions in the biological environment that are not accessible by a single label. However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross&#8208;reactivity. We developed a pair of two differently modified 2&#8217;&#8209;deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcyclopropenyl&#8208;modified 2&#8217;&#8209;deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest&#8208;reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions. Their orthogonal reactivity could be evidenced in vitro. Primer extension experiments were performed with both 2&#8216;&#8209;deoxyuridines investigating their replication properties as substitutes for thymidine and evaluating subsequent labeling reactions on the DNA level. Finally, dual, orthogonal and metabolic fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA was demonstrated in HeLa cells. An experimental procedure was developed combining intracellular transport and metabolic DNA incorporation of the two 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines with the subsequent dual bioorthogonal labeling using a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl tetrazine and a fluorogenic pyrene&#8208;tetrazole. These results are fundamental for advanced metabolic labeling strategies for nucleic acids in the future, especially for live cell experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Responsive Anionophores with AND Logic Multi&#8208;stimuli activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulus&#8208;responsive systems that offer spatiotemporally controlled activity for targeted applications remain rare. Here we utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of&#160;a 4,6&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;isophthalamide&#160;core to generate a modular platform enabling access to stimuli&#8208;responsive ion transporters that can be activated in response to wide variety of external stimuli, including light, redox, and enzymes, with excellent OFF&#8208;ON activation profiles. Alkylation of the two free hydroxyl groups with stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties locks the amide bonds through intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hence makes them unavailable for anion binding and transport. Triggering using a particular stimulus to cleave both cages reverses the hydrogen bonding arrangement, to generate a highly preorganized anion binding cavity for efficient transmembrane transport. Integration of two cages that are responsive to orthogonal stimuli enables multi&#8208;stimuli activation, where both stimuli are required to trigger transport in an AND logic process. Importantly, the strategy provides a facile method to post&#8208;functionalize the highly active transporter core a with variety of stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties for targeted activation with multiple triggers.</dc:description>

         <title>Correspondence to &#8220;Structure of Violet Phosphorus and Its Phosphorene Exfoliation&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 1865 Johann Wilhelm Hittorf discovered violet phosphorus and it took until 1969 when Thurn and Krebs determined the structure of orthogonally arranged tubes with pentagonal cross&#8208;sections. Different to their claim, the structure determined by Zhang et&#8197;al. in 2020 depicted in orange is identical to the 1969 structure shown in green and should not be referenced as a new polymorph.







Abstract
The structure described in the publication &#8220;Structure of Violet Phosphorus and Its Phosphorene Exfoliation&#8221; (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 1074&#8211;1080) is identical to the structure by Thurn and Krebs determined already in 1969 and therefore by no means a new modification.

         <title>A Fast&#8208;Charge Graphite Anode with a Li&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conductive, Electron/Solvent&#8208;Repelling Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite has been serving as the key anode material of rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet is difficultly charged within a quarter hour while maintaining stable electrochemistry. In addition to a defective edge structure that prevents fast Li&#8208;ion entry, the high&#8208;rate performance of graphite could be hampered by co&#8208;intercalation and parasitic reduction of solvent molecules at anode/electrolyte interface. Conventional surface modification by pitch&#8208;derived carbon barely isolates the solvent and electrons, and usually lead to inadequate rate capability to meet practical fast&#8208;charge requirements. Here we show that, by applying a MoOx&#8208;MoNx layer onto graphite surface, the interface allows fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion yet blocks solvent access and electron leakage. By regulating interfacial mass and charge transfer, the modified graphite anode delivers a reversible capacity of 340.3 mAh g&#8208;1 after 4000 cycles at 6C, showing promises in building 10&#8208;min&#8208;rechargeable batteries with a long operation life.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic RNA Targeting Triggers Indiscriminate DNase Activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system has emerged as a powerful tool for nucleic acid&#8208;based molecular diagnostics. However, it has long been believed to be effective only on DNA targets. Here, we investigate the intrinsic RNA&#8208;enabled trans&#8208;cleavage activity of AsCas12a and LbCas12a and discover that they can be directly activated by fully complementary RNA targets, although LbCas12a exhibits weaker trans&#8208;cleavage activity than AsCas12a on single&#8208;stranded DNA and RNA substrates. Remarkably, we find that the RNA&#8208;activated Cas12a exhibits higher specificity compared to DNA activation. Based on these findings, we develop the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for nucleic acid testing. We incorporate a T7 transcription step into this assay, thereby eliminating the requirement for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target. Additionally, we successfully detect multiple PAM&#8208;less targets in HIV clinical samples that are undetectable by the conventional Cas12a assay, demonstrating random target selection with the UNIVERSE assay. We further validate the clinical utility of the UNIVERSE assay by testing both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples. We envision that the intrinsic RNA targeting capability may bring a paradigm shift in Cas12a&#8208;based nucleic acid detection and further enhance the understanding of CRISPR&#8208;Cas biochemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) as fluoroallyl surrogates under transition&#8208;metal catalysis has drawn considerable attention recently but such reactions are restricted to producing achiral or racemic mono&#8208;fluoroalkenes. Herein, we report the first enantioselective allylation of indoles under rhodium catalysis with gem&#8208;DFCPs. This reaction shows exceptional branched regioselectivity towards rhodium catalysis with gem&#8208;DFCPs, which provides an efficient route to enantioenriched fluoroallylated indoles with wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate in a NaOH&#8208;KOH&#8208;H2O Ternary Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A glut of dinitrogen&#8208;derived ammonia (NH3) over the past century has resulted in a heavily imbalanced nitrogen cycle and consequently, the large&#8208;scale accumulation of reactive nitrogen such as nitrates in our ecosystems has led to detrimental environmental issues. Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste nitrogen back into NH3 holds promise in mitigating these environmental impacts and reducing reliance on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance electrolyzer using an ultrahigh alkalinity electrolyte, NaOH&#8208;KOH&#8208;H2O, for low&#8208;cost NH3 electrosynthesis. At 3,000 mA/cm2, the device with a Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Ni ternary catalyst achieves an unprecedented faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5&#177;1.5% under a low cell voltage of 3.83 V; whereas at 1,000 mA/cm2, an FE of 96.5&#177;4.8% under a cell voltage of only 2.40 V. Techno&#8208;economic analysis revealed that our device cuts the levelized cost of ammonia electrosynthesis by ~40% ($30.68 for Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Ni vs. $48.53 for Ni foam per kmol&#8208;NH3). The NaOH&#8208;KOH&#8208;H2O electrolyte together with the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Ni ternary catalyst can enable the high&#8208;throughput nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia applications for affordable and scalable real&#8208;world wastewater treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Defects in Amorphous Silicon with Million&#8208;Atom Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si) is widely thought of as a fourfold&#8208;connected random network, and yet it is defective atoms, with fewer or more than four bonds, that make it particularly interesting. Despite many attempts to explain such &#8220;dangling&#8208;bond&#8221; and &#8220;floating&#8208;bond&#8221; defects, respectively, a unified understanding is still missing. Here, we use advanced computational chemistry methods to reveal the complex structural and energetic landscape of defects in a&#8208;Si. We study an ultra&#8208;large&#8208;scale, quantum&#8208;accurate structural model containing a million atoms, and thousands of individual defects, allowing reliable defect&#8208;related statistics to be obtained. We combine structural descriptors and machinelearned atomic energies to develop a classification of the different types of defects in a&#8208;Si. The results suggest a revision of the established floating&#8208;bond model by showing that fivefold&#8208;bonded atoms in a&#8208;Si exhibit a wide range of local environments&#8212;analogous to fivefold centers in coordination chemistry. Furthermore, it is shown that fivefold (but not threefold) coordination defects tend to cluster together. Our study provides new insights into one of the most widely studied amorphous solids, and has general implications for understanding defects in disordered materials beyond silicon alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Toughening of Interpenetrated Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent work has demonstrated that temporary crosslinks in polymer networks generated by chemical &#8220;fuels&#8221; afford materials with large, transient changes in their mechanical properties. This can be accomplished in carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polymer hydrogels using carbodiimides, which generate anhydride crosslinks with lifetimes on the order of minutes to hours. Here, the impact of the polymer network architecture on the mechanical properties of transiently crosslinked materials was explored. Single networks (SNs) were compared to interpenetrated networks (IPNs). Notably, semi&#8208;IPN precursors that give IPNs on treatment with the carbodiimide give much higher fracture energies (i.e., resistance to fracture) and superior resistance to compressive strain compared to other network architectures. A precursor semi&#8208;IPN material featuring acrylic acid in only the free polymer chains yields, on treatment with carbodiimide, an IPN with a fracture energy of 2400 J/m2, a fourfold increase compared to an analogous semi&#8208;IPN precursor that yields a SN. This resistance to fracture enables the formation of macroscopic complex cut patterns, even at high strain, underscoring the pivotal role of polymer architecture in mechanical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Switchable Peroxidase/Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of Carbon Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes possess multi&#8208;enzyme activities over the natural enzymes, which produce multi&#8208;pathway synergistic effects&#160;for varies of biomedical applications. Unfortunately, their&#160;multi&#8208;enzyme activities&#160;are in fighting, significantly reducing the synergistic effects. Dynamic regulation of their multi&#8208;enzyme activities is the bottleneck for intelligent therapies. Herein, we construct a novel oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) with peroxidase&#8208;like&#160;(Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer) activity. Interestingly, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity can be reversibly converted to catalase&#8208;like&#160;(ROS scavenger) activity under visible light irradiation. It is found that both the peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity. The mechanism of switchable enzyme activities is attributed to the polarization of quinoid nitrogen in polyaniline (PANI) precursor retained on O/N&#8208;CQDs under visible light, which consumes the ROS to produce O2&#160;and H2O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we are able to non&#8208;intrusively up and down regulate the ROS level in cells successfully by simply switching off and on the light&#160;respectively, potentially facilitating the precise medicine based on the development of the disease. Indeed, the photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs opens a non&#8208;invasive strategy for better manipulations of the multi&#8208;activity of nanozymes, promising their wider and more intelligent biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Salts of protonated sulfur dioxide were synthesized by recrystallization of [FS(OX)2][SbF6] (X&#160;=&#160;H, D) in aprotic solvents at low temperatures. Hemiprotonated sulfur dioxide [(SO2)2H][Sb2F11] was obtained from the solvent SO2 and the monoprotonated sulfur dioxide [OSOD][Sb2F11], using 1,1,1,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethane as solvent. For both compounds, single crystals were obtained and an X&#8208;ray structure analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the salts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and the results were discussed together with quantum chemical calculations on the M06&#8208;2X/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of optoelectronically&#8208;active soft materials is drawing attention to the application of soft electronics. A room&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free liquid obtained by modifying a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with flexible yet bulky alkyl chains is a promising functional soft material. Tuning the elastic modulus (G&#8242;) is essential for employing optoelectronically&#8208;active alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids in deformable devices. However, the range of G&#8242; achieved through the molecular design of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids is limited. We report herein a method for controlling G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by gelation. Adding 1 wt% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator formed the alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gel (FMG) and increased G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Because alkyl&#8211;&#960; FMGs have functional &#960;&#8208;moieties in the gel medium, this new class of gels has a much higher content of &#960;&#8208;moieties of up to 59 wt% compared to conventional &#960;&#8208;gels of only a few wt%. More importantly, the gel state has a 23% higher charge&#8208;retention capacity than the liquid, providing better performance in deformable mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices. The strategy used in this study is a novel approach for developing next&#8208;generation optoelectronically&#8208;active FMG materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution in Neutral Media by Differential Intermediate Binding at Charge&#8208;modulated Sites of a Bimetallic Alloy Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential intermediate binding on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam (NF), where the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is only 50 &#177; 9 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2. It has a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18 s&#8208;1, mass activity of 13.2 A g&#8208;1 at &#8208;200 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and produces 16 ml H2 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;300 mV vs. RHE, more than double that of 20% Pt/C. The Mod+ and Cod&#8208; sites adsorb OH*, and H*, respectively, and the electron injection from Co to H&#8208;O&#8208;H cleaves the O&#8208;H bond to form the Mo&#8208;OH* intermediate. Operando spectral analyses indicate a weak H&#8208;bonded network for facilitating the H2O*/OH* transport, and a potential&#8208;induced reversal of the charge density from Co to the more electronegative Mo, because of the electron withdrawing Co&#8208;H* and Mo&#8208;OH* species. Co85Mo15/NF can also drive the complete electrolysis of neutral water at only 1.73 V (10 mA cm&#8208;2). In alkaline, and acidic media, it demonstrates a Pt&#8208;like HER activity, accomplishing &#8208;1000 mA cm&#8208;2 at overpotentials of 161 &#177; 7, and 175 &#177; 22 mV, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Ethylene Epoxidation by Single Atom Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of ethylene oxide (EO) using ethylene and water under ambient conditions presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative to existing industrial production process. Yet, the electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation route is currently hindered by largely insufficient activity, EO selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report a single atom Ru&#8208;doped hollandite structure KIr4O8 (KIrRuO) nanowire catalyst for efficient EO production via a chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene epoxidation process. The KIrRuO catalyst exhibits an EO partial current density up to 0.7 A cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0%. The impressive electrocatalytic performance towards ethylene epoxidation is ascribed to the modulation of electronic structure of adjacent Ir sites by single Ru atoms, which stabilizes the *CH2CH2OH intermediate and facilitates the formation of active Cl2 species during the generation of 2&#8208;chloroethanol, the precursor of EO. This work provides a single atom modulation strategy for improving the reactivity of adjacent metal sites in heterogeneous electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Dienes for Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of two distal stereocenters through a single catalytic process is of great interest in organic synthesis. While there are some successful reports regarding stereodivergent preparation of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;stereocenters, the more challenged 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters have never been achieved in a stereodivergent fashion. Herein we describe a synergistic palladium/copper catalysis for 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes, providing access to 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent quaternary stereocenters. Because each of the two catalysts separately controlled one of the newly formed stereocenters, stereodivergent synthesis of all four diastereomers of the products could readily be achieved simply by choosing an appropriate combination of chiral catalysts. Experimental and computational studies supported a mechanism involving a Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost cascade reaction, and the origins of the stereoselectivity were elucidated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed reconstructing connected hydrogen&#8208;bond networks on the spinel surface by coupling hydrophilic units to defuse the trade&#8208;off of free water migration and deprotonation. The designed Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN as a non&#8208;precious OER catalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 395&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an acidic medium and even surpasses RuO2 activity at high current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ ~538&#8197;mV).







Abstract
Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstructs a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network between the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8722;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ ~538&#8197;mV).

         <title>Long&#8208;cycling and High&#8208;voltage Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Fluorinated and Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated and crosslinked polyether electrolyte (FGPE) exhibiting excellent oxidation stability was developed, which enabled the polymer electrolyte&#8208;based Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries to achieve the longest cycling of 1000 cycles and high operating voltage of 4.7&#8197;V. Notably, solid&#8208;state industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical cells were first reported with an outstanding stability (500 cycles).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), constructed through the in situ fabrication of polymer electrolytes, are considered a critical strategy for the next&#8208;generation battery systems with high energy density and enhanced safety. However, the constrained oxidation stability of polymers, such as the extensively utilized polyethers, limits their applications in high&#8208;voltage batteries and further energy density improvements. Herein, an in situ fabricated fluorinated and crosslinked polyether&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte, FGPE, is presented, exhibiting a high oxidation potential (5.1&#8197;V). The fluorinated polyether significantly improves compatibility with both lithium metal and high&#8208;voltage cathode, attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8722;CF3 group and the generated LiF&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interphase. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries employing FGPE demonstrate exceptional cycling performances of 1000 cycles with 78&#8201;% retention, representing one of the best results ever reported for polymer electrolytes. Moreover, FGPE enables batteries to operate at 4.7&#8197;V, realizing the highest operating voltage of polyether&#8208;based batteries to date. Notably, our designed in situ FGPE provides the solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling stability even at practical conditions, including high cathode loading (21&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and industry&#8208;level 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells (1.3&#8197;Ah, 500 cycles). This work provides critical insights into the development of oxidation&#8208;stable polymer electrolytes and the advancement of practical high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Modulation by Co (II) Ion of Optical Activities of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified Chiral Copper Nanoclusters for Sensitive Adenosine Triphosphate Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the regulation ability of Co2+ toward the chiral and fluorescent optical activities of chiral Cu NCs is discovered, which produces strong chiral optical activity (the asymmetry factor of chirality is enhanced by a factor of 223), and its distribution is modulated from the UV region to the visible region. More importantly, the chirality effect on the detection sensitivity of chiral biological targets is well illustrated, providing helpful guidance for constructing chiral nanoprobes with better detection performances for chiral biotargets.







Abstract
Chiral nanoscale enantiomers exhibit different biological effects in living systems. However, their chirality effect on the detection sensitivity for chiral biological targets still needs to be explored. Here, we discovered that Co2+ can modulate the luminescence performance of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified copper nanoclusters (L/D&#8722;Cu NCs) and induce strong chiroptical activities as the asymmetric factor was enhanced 223&#8208;fold with their distribution regulating from the ultraviolet to visible region. One Co2+ coordinated with two GSH molecules that modified on the surface of Cu NCs in the way of CoN2O2. On this basis, dual&#8208;modal chiral and luminescent signals of Co2+ coordinated L/D&#8722;Cu NCs (L/D&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs) were used to detect the chiral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) based on the competitive interaction between surficial GSH and ATP molecules with Co2+. The limits of detection of ATP obtained with fluorescence and circular dichroism intensity were 9.15&#8197;&#956;M and 15.75&#8197;nM for L&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs, and 5.35&#8197;&#956;M and 4.69&#8197;nM for D&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs. This demonstrated that selecting suitable chiral configurations of nanoprobes effectively enhances detection sensitivity. This study presents not only a novel method to modulate and enhance the chiroptical activity of nanomaterials but also a unique perspective of chirality effects on the detection performances for bio&#8208;targets.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor in Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Tuning Molecular Electrostatic Potential Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized an outstanding acceptor material, namely ITOC6&#8208;4F, characterized by a considerably low amplitude of electrostatic potential fluctuation (0.8&#8197;kcal/mol). The ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell exhibits an extremely low bimolecular recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Consequently, this has led to the attainment of a new record fill factor of 0.816 in binary organic photovoltaic cells.







Abstract
In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), significant progress has been made in tailoring molecular structures to enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage and the short&#8208;circuit current density. However, there remains a crucial gap in the development of coordinated material design strategies focused on improving the fill factor (FF). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that incorporates electrostatic potential fluctuation to design organic photovoltaic materials. By reducing the fluctuation amplitude of IT&#8208;4F, we synthesized a new acceptor named ITOC6&#8208;4F. When using PBQx&#8208;TF as a donor, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell shows a markedly low recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1 and demonstrates an outstanding FF of 0.816, both of which are new records for binary OPV cells. Also, we find that a small fluctuation amplitude could decrease the energetic disorder of OPV cells, reducing energy loss. Finally, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell creates the highest efficiency of 16.0&#8201;% among medium&#8208;gap OPV cells. Our work holds a vital implication for guiding the design of high&#8208;performance OPV materials.

         <title>Discovery of Selective and Potent ATR Degrader for Exploration its Kinase&#8208;Independent Functions in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present work, a selective and potent ATR degrader was identified which was used as probe for explore the kinase&#8208;independent function of ATR. The results showed that ATR kinase inhibitor induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited the growth of AML&#8197;cells. The ATR degrader was inclined to trigger immediate apoptosis in AML&#8197;cells. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that ATR deletion induced nuclear envelope rupture, leading to genome instability, irreparable DNA damage. It causes to upregulate the level of p53 and subsequently triggers p53&#8208;mediated cell apoptosis.







Abstract
ATR has emerged as a promising target for anti&#8208;cancer drug development. Several potent ATR inhibitors are currently undergoing various stages of clinical trials, but none have yet received FDA approval due to unclear regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we discovered a potent and selective ATR degrader. Its kinase&#8208;independent regulatory functions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were elucidated using this proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule as a probe. The ATR degrader, 8&#8201;i, exhibited significantly different cellular phenotypes compared to the ATR kinase inhibitor 1. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATR deletion led to breakdown in the nuclear envelope, causing genome instability and extensive DNA damage. This would increase the expression of p53 and triggered immediately p53&#8208;mediated apoptosis signaling pathway, which was earlier and more effective than ATR kinase inhibition. Based on these findings, the in vivo anti&#8208;proliferative effects of ATR degrader 8&#8201;i were assessed using xenograft models. The degrader significantly inhibited the growth of AML&#8197;cells in vivo, unlike the ATR inhibitor. These results suggest that the marked anti&#8208;AML activity is regulated by the kinase&#8208;independent functions of the ATR protein. Consequently, developing potent and selective ATR degraders could be a promising strategy for treating AML.

         <title>Overcoming Thermal Quenching in X&#8208;ray Scintillators through Multi&#8208;Excited State Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of the hybrid perovskite TpyBiCl5 scintillator to switch between TDAF and phosphorescence modes at elevated temperatures provides an effective solution to overcome thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray scintillators have gained significant attention in medical diagnostics and industrial applications. Despite their widespread utility, scintillator development faces a significant hurdle when exposed to elevated temperatures, as it usually results in reduced scintillation efficiency and diminished luminescence output. Here we report a molecular design strategy based on a hybrid perovskite (TpyBiCl5) that overcomes thermal quenching through multi&#8208;excited state switching. The structure of perovskite provides a platform to modulate the luminescence centers. The rigid framework constructed by this perovskite structure stabilized its triplet states, resulting in TpyBiCl5 exhibiting an approximately 12&#8197;times higher (45&#8201;% vs. 3.8&#8201;%) photoluminescence quantum yield of room temperature phosphorescence than that of its organic ligand (Tpy). Most importantly, the interactions between the components of this perovskite enable the mixing of different excited states, which has been revealed by experimental and theoretical investigations. The TpyBiCl5 scintillator exhibits a detection limit of 38.92&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 213&#8197;K and a detection limit of 196.31&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 353&#8197;K through scintillation mode switching between thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence. This work opens up the possibility of solving the thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray scintillators by tuning different excited states.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Polymers Constructed from Dynamic Coordination Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel strategy with reversible coordination equilibria for fabricating rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsive mechanically adaptive materials. Based on dynamic coordination interactions, the developed polymers demonstrate excellent energy dissipation, damping, self&#8208;healing and 3D printing properties, providing potential applications in durable and customizable impact protection fields.







Abstract
Designing materials capable of adapting their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli is the key to preventing failure and extending their service life. However, existing mechanically adaptive polymers are hindered by limitations such as inadequate load&#8208;bearing capacity, difficulty in achieving reversible changes, high cost, and a lack of multiple responsiveness. Herein, we address these challenges using dynamic coordination bonds. A new type of mechanically adaptive material with both rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsiveness was developed. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the coordination equilibria, the prepared polymers, PBMBD&#8208;Fe and PBMBD&#8208;Co, exhibit mechanically adaptive properties, including temperature&#8208;sensitive strength modulation and rate&#8208;dependent impact hardening. Benefitting from the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, the polymers exhibited impressive energy dissipation, damping capacity (loss factors of 1.15 and 2.09 at 1.0&#8197;Hz), self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing abilities, offering durable and customizable impact resistance and protective performance. The development of impact&#8208;resistant materials with comprehensive properties has potential applications in the sustainable and intelligent protection fields.

         <title>Organic Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift for the Visualization of Rapid Protein and Nucleic Acid Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling organic modules like building blocks, we explored design strategies for large Stokes shift fluorophores. A series of wavelength&#8208;tunable fluorophores have been synthesized, which exhibit large Stokes shift and satisfactory brightness. Furthermore, these dyes were applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, direct visualization of protein assays with 100&#8208;fold sensitivity improvement over colloidal gold based LFA was achieved.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores, characterized by flexible chemical structure and adjustable optical performance, have shown tremendous potential in biosensing. However, classical organic fluorophore motifs feature large overlap between excitation and emission spectra, leading to the requirement of advanced optical set up to filter desired signal, which limits their application in scenarios with simple settings. Here, a series of wavelength&#8208;tunable small&#8208;molecule fluorescent dyes (PTs) bearing simple organic moieties have been developed, which exhibit Stokes shift up to 262&#8197;nm, molar extinction coefficients ranged 30,000&#8211;100,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with quantum yields up to 54.8&#8201;%. Furthermore, these dyes were formulated into fluorescent nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs), and applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, limit of detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein reached 20&#8197;fM with naked eye, a 100&#8208;fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the pM detection level for colloidal gold&#8208;based LFA. Besides, combined with loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the LFA system achieved the visualization of single copy level nucleic acid detection for monkeypox (Mpox).

         <title>Polymer Dots with Delayed Fluorescence and Tunable Cellular Uptake for Photodynamic Therapy and Time&#8208;Gated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic block copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembling into polymer dots (Pdots) with both delayed emission and singlet oxygen generation were prepared. The hydrophobic core shields an emitter with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) to allow for time&#8208;gated spectroscopy. Simultaneously, the hydrophilic corona exposes a photosensitizer to allow for photodynamic therapy (PDT) through a theranostic approach. In vitro studies with HeLa cells show that the nature of the hydrophilic corona can alter uptake while maintaining PDT efficiency.







Abstract
By combining bioimaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT), it is possible to treat cancer through a theranostic approach with targeted action for minimum invasiveness and side effects. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) probes have gained recent interest in theranostics due to their ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) while providing delayed emission that can be used in time&#8208;gated imaging. However, it is still challenging to design systems that simultaneously show (1) high contrast for imaging, (2) low dark toxicity but high phototoxicity and (3) tunable biological uptake. Here, we circumvent shortcomings of TADF systems by designing block copolymers and their corresponding semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) that encapsulate a TADF dye in the core and expose an additional boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) oxygen sensitizer in the corona. This architecture provides orange&#8208;red luminescent particles (&#934;PL up to 18&#8201;%) that can efficiently promote PDT (1O2 QY=42&#8201;%) of HeLa cells with very low photosensitizer loading (IC50 ~0.05&#8211;0.13&#8197;&#956;g/mL after 30&#8197;min). Additionally, we design Pdots with tunable cellular uptake but similar PDT efficiencies using either polyethylene glycol or guanidinium&#8208;based coronas. Finally, we demonstrate that these Pdots can be used for time&#8208;gated imaging to effectively filter out background fluorescence from biological samples and improve image contrast.

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformer selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism of chiral 1&#8208;indanol is obtained via a resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization Scheme, thanks to the selectivity due to the S1&#8592;S0 transition. The equatorial and axial conformers of 1&#8208;indanol display PECD that dramatically differ in both amplitude and sign.







Abstract
Conformational flexibility and chirality both play a key role in molecular recognition. It is therefore very useful to develop spectroscopic methods that simultaneously probe both properties. It has been theoretically predicted that photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) should be very sensitive to conformational isomerism. However, experimental proof has been less forthcoming and only exists for a very few favorable cases. Here, we present a new PECD scheme based on resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization (RE2PI) using UV/Vis nanosecond laser excitations. The spectral resolution obtained thereby guarantees conformer&#8208;selectivity by inducing resonant conformer&#8208;specific &#960;&#960;* S1&#8592;S0 transitions. We apply this experimental scheme to the study of chiral 1&#8208;indanol, which exists in two conformers linked by a ring inversion and defined by the position of the hydroxyl group, namely axial and equatorial. We show that the PECD of the equatorial and axial forms considerably differ in sign, magnitude and shape. We also discuss the influence of the total ionization energy, vibronic excitation of intermediate and final states, and relative polarization of the excitation and ionization lasers. Conformer&#8208;specificity adds a new dimension to the applications of PECD in analytical chemistry addressing now the general case of floppy systems.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Multilevel Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Memristors are essential components of neuromorphic systems that mimic the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neurons. In this study, a novel approach employing one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF) films was explored to enhance the performance of memristors. The unique structural and electronic properties of two 1D COF films (COF&#8208;4,4'&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA) and COF&#8208;4,4'&#8208;oxydianiline (ODA)) offer advantages for multilevel resistive switching, which is a key feature in neuromorphic computing applications. By further introducing a TiO2&#160;layer on the COF&#8208;ODA film, a built&#8208;in electric field between the COF&#8208;TiO2&#160;interfaces could be generated, demonstrating&#160;the feasibility of utilizing COFs as a platform for constructing memristors with tunable resistive states. The 1D nanochannels of these COF structures contributed to the efficient modulation of electrical conductance, enabling precise control over synaptic weights in neuromorphic circuits. This study also investigated the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors to achieve energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Euphorbia Diterpenoid Pepluacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the Euphorbia diterpenoid pepluacetal is disclosed in both racemic and chiral fashions. The synthesis strategically relies on a photo&#8208;induced Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction to access the cyclobutane moiety, a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/cyclopropanation sequence to rapidly forge the 7&#8211;3 bicyclic system, and a late&#8208;stage Rh&#8208;catalyzed transannular carbenoid insertion to C(sp3)&#8211;H bond followed by a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation and ring&#8208;opening manipulations to install the side chain. The synthetic route demonstrates excellent stereochemical control on the non&#8208;classical concave&#8208;face bond formation and high scalability to provide 20 mg of (+)&#8208;pepluacetal.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Reaction in Organic Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The doped organic hole transport layer (HTL) is crucial for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the traditional doping strategy undergoes a time&#8208;consuming and environment&#8208;dependent oxidation process, which hinders the technology upgrades and commercialization of PSCs. Here, we reported a new strategy by introducing a cascade reaction in traditional doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which can simultaneously achieve rapid oxidation and overcome the erosion of perovskite by 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP) in organic HTL. The ideal dopant iodobenzene diacetate was utilized as the initiator that can react with Spiro to generate Spiro&#8226;+ radicals quickly and efficiently without the participation of ambient air, with the byproduct of iodobenzene (DB). Then, the DB can coordinate with tBP through a halogen bond to form a tBP&#8208;DB complex, minimizing the sustained erosion from tBP to perovskite. Based on the above cascade reaction, the resulting Spiro&#8208;based PSCs have a champion PCE of 25.76% (certificated of 25.38%). This new oxidation process of HTL is less environment&#8208;dependent and produces PSCs with higher reproducibility. Moreover, the PTAA&#8208;based PSCs obtain a PCE of 23.76%, demonstrating the excellent applicability of this doping strategy on organic HTL.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Therapeutic Effects of Ferroptosis on Myocardial Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Using Dual&#8208;Locking Mitochondrial Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research of ferroptosis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) using mitochondrial viscosity as a nexus holds great promise for MIRI therapeutics. However, high precision visualizing mitochondrial viscosity remains a formidable task owing to the debilitating electrostatic interaction caused by damaged mitochondrial membrane potential. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;locking mitochondrial targeting strategy that incorporates the idea of electrostatic forces and probe&#8208;protein molecular docking. Even in the damaged mitochondria, stable and precise visualization of mitochondrial viscosity in triggered and medicated MIRI was achieved owing to the sustained driving forces (pi&#8208;cation, pi&#8208;alkyl interactions etc.) between the developed probe CBS and mitochondrial membrane protein. Moreover, complemented by the western blot technology, we confirmed that ferrostatin&#8208;1 exerts its therapeutic effect on MIRI by improving the system xc&#8722;/GSH/GPX4 antioxidant system, confirming the therapeutic value of ferroptosis in MIRI. This work presents a new strategy for developing robust mitochondrial probes, thereby advancing the treatments for MIRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Validating &#916;&#916;G Selectivity Descriptor for Electrosynthesis of H2O2&#160;from Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding selectivity trends is a crucial hurdle in the developing innovative catalysts for generating hydrogen peroxide through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR). The identification of selectivity patterns has been made more accessible through the introduction of a newly developed selectivity descriptor derived from thermodynamics, denoted as &#916;&#916;G introduced in Chem Catal.2023, 3 (3), 100568. To validate the suitability of this parameter as a descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity, we utilize an extensive library of 155 binary alloys. We validate that &#916;&#916;G reliably depicts the selectivity trends in binary alloys reported for their high activity in the 2e&#8208;ORR. This analysis also enables the identification of nine selective 2e&#8208;ORR catalysts underscoring the efficacy of &#916;&#916;G as 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity descriptor. This work highlights the significance of concurrently considering both selectivity and activity trends. This holistic approach is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding in the identification of high&#8208;performance catalyst materials for optimal efficiency in various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer: A&#160;Simple Strategy for an Efficient Visible Light&#8208;Induced Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoclick reactions combine the advantages offered by light&#8208;driven processes and classical click chemistry and have found applications ranging from surface functionalization, polymer conjugation, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and protein labeling. Despite these advances, the dependency of most of the photoclick reactions on UV light poses a severe obstacle for their general implementation, as this light can be absorbed by other molecules in the system resulting in their degradation or unwanted reactivity. However, the development of a simple and efficient system to achieve bathochromically shifted photoclick transformations remains challenging. Here, we introduce triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer as a fast and selective way to enable visible light&#8208;induced photoclick reactions. Specifically, we show that 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) can efficiently react with electron&#8208;rich alkenes (ERAs) in the presence of a catalytic amount (as little as 5 mol%) of photosensitizers. The photocycloaddition reaction can be achieved under green (530 nm) or orange (590 nm) light irradiation, representing a bathochromic shift of over 100 nm as compared to the classical PQ&#8208;ERAs system. Furthermore, by combining appropriate reactants, we establish an orthogonal, blue and green light&#8208;induced photoclick reaction system in which the product distribution can be precisely controlled by the choice of the color of light.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis and characterization of a series of (mostly) air&#8208;stable diorganyl bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide (BPI) aluminum complexes and their chemistry upon visible&#8208;light excitation. The redox non&#8208;innocent BPI pincer ligand allows for efficient charge transfer homolytic processes of the title compounds. This makes them a universal platform for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals. The photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of the Al&#8211;C bonds was investigated by means of stationary and transient UV/Vis spectroscopy, spin trapping experiments, as well as EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental findings were supported by quantum chemical calculations. Reactivity studies enabled the utilization of the aluminum complexes as reactants in tin&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type reactions and carbonyl alkylations under ambient conditions, which both indicated radical&#8208;polar crossover behavior. A deeper understanding of the physical fundamentals and photochemical process was provided, furnishing in turn a new strategy to control the reactivity of bench&#8208;stable aluminum organometallics.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Nondirected Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8211;H Deuteration of Heteroarenes Enabled Through a Multi&#8208;Substrate Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of deuterium labelling in a variety of applications, ranging from mechanistic studies to drug&#8208;discovery, has spurred immense interest in the development of new methods for its efficient incorporation in organic, and especially in bioactive molecules. The five&#8208;membered heteroarenes at the center of this work are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules and efficient methods for the deuterium labelling of these compounds are therefore highly desirable. However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8211;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent effects in catalytic reactions have received widespread attention as they can promote reaction rates and product selectivities by orders of magnitude. It is well accepted that the stable five&#8208;membered cyclic intermediates formed between the solvent molecules and Ti species are crucial to the alkene epoxidation in a heterogeneous Ti(IV)&#8208;H2O2 system. However, the direct spectroscopic evidence of these intermediates is still missing and the corresponding reaction pathway for the alkene epoxidation remains unclear. By combining in situ 13C MAS NMR, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 1H&#8208;13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the five&#8208;membered ring structures, where the protic solvents (ROH), and aprotic solvent (acetone), coordinate and stabilize the active Ti species, are identified for the first time over Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system. Moreover, the role of these cyclic intermediates in the alkene epoxidation/hydration conversion is clarified. These results provide new insights into the solvent effect in liquid&#8208;phase epoxidation/hydration reactions over Ti(IV)&#8208;H2O2 system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of a dual resin for photobiocatalysis, encompassing both a photocatalyst and an immobilized enzyme, brings several challenges including effective immobilization, maintaining photocatalyst and enzyme activity and ensuring sufficient light penetration. However, the benefits such as integrated processes, reusability, easier product separation, and potential for scalability can outweigh these challenges, making dual resin systems promising for efficient and sustainable photobiocatalytic applications. In this work we employ a photosensitizer&#8208;containing porous emulsion&#8208;templated polymer as a functional support that is used to covalently anchor a chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO). We demonstrate the versatility of this heterogeneous photobiocatalytic material which enables the bromination of four aromatic substrates, including Rutin &#8211; a natural occurring flavonol &#8211; under blue light (456 nm) irradiation and continuous flow conditions.</dc:description>

A selenium&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely BBSeE, is designed and synthesized for constructing ambipolar polymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, featuring narrower band gap, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO. pN&#8208;BBSeE demonstrates ideally balanced ambipolar TFT performances with hole and electron mobility values up to 10.65 and 10.72&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, which is among the best ambipolar polymers reported so far.







Abstract
The lack of ambipolar polymers with balanced hole (&#956;h) and electron mobilities (&#956;e) &gt;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is the main bottleneck for developing organic integrated circuits. Herein, we show the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended selenium&#8208;containing acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethane (BBSeE), to address this dilemma. In comparison to its sulfur&#8208;counterpart, BBSeE demonstrates enlarged co&#8208;planarity, selective noncovalent interactions, polarized Se&#8722;N bond, and higher electron affinity. The successful stannylation of BBSeE offers a great opportunity to access acceptor&#8208;acceptor copolymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, which shows a narrower band gap, lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (&#8722;4.05&#8197;eV), and a higher degree of backbone planarity. Consequently, the pN&#8208;BBSeE&#8208;based organic transistors display an ideally balanced ambipolar transporting property with &#956;h and &#956;e of 10.65 and 10.72&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous &#956;h/&#956;e values &gt;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 are the best performances ever reported for ambipolar polymers. In addition, pN&#8208;BBSeE shows an excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability, retaining over 85&#8201;% of the initial mobility values after two months storage. Our study demonstrates the &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric BBSeE is a promising acceptor building block for constructing high&#8208;performance ambipolar polymers applied in next&#8208;generation organic integrated circuit.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Preparation for Efficient and Photostable Pure&#8208;Iodide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique is devised to fabricate photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared with wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from anti&#8208;solvent process, the ASF method significantly improves the device performance and reproducibility. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride is applied to enhance the crystallinity. Consequently, the ASF&#8208;based PSCs deliver a highest PCE of 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability.







Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (TSC) has attracted tremendous attention due to its potential to breakthrough the theoretical efficiency set for single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) designed as its top component cell suffers from severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation owing to its mixed&#8208;halide strategy for achieving desirable wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#8197;eV). Developing pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites is a promising route to fabricate photostable perovskite/silicon TSCs. Here, we report efficient and photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique. The ASF process is achieved by mixing two precursor solutions, both of which are capable of depositing corresponding perovskite films without involving anti&#8208;solvent. The mixed solution finally forms Cs0.3DMA0.2MA0.5PbI3 perovskite film with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride additive is applied to enhance the crystallinity and reduce the trap density of perovskite films. As a result, the pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSC delivers efficiency as high as 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability, the highest for this type of solar cells.

     alt="Anti-Solvent-Free Preparation for Efficient and Photostable Pure-Iodide Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anti-solvent-free (ASF) technique is devised to fabricate photostable pure-iodide wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared with wide-bandgap PSCs made from anti-solvent process, the ASF method significantly improves the device performance and reproducibility. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride is applied to enhance the crystallinity. Consequently, the ASF-based PSCs deliver a highest PCE of 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (TSC) has attracted tremendous attention due to its potential to breakthrough the theoretical efficiency set for single-junction solar cells. However, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) designed as its top component cell suffers from severe photo-induced halide segregation owing to its mixed-halide strategy for achieving desirable wide-bandgap (1.68&#8197;eV). Developing pure-iodide wide-bandgap perovskites is a promising route to fabricate photostable perovskite/silicon TSCs. Here, we report efficient and photostable pure-iodide wide-bandgap PSCs made from an anti-solvent-free (ASF) technique. The ASF process is achieved by mixing two precursor solutions, both of which are capable of depositing corresponding perovskite films without involving anti-solvent. The mixed solution finally forms Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;DMA&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite film with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride additive is applied to enhance the crystallinity and reduce the trap density of perovskite films. As a result, the pure-iodide wide-bandgap PSC delivers efficiency as high as 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability, the highest for this type of solar cells. The ASF method significantly improves the device reproducibility as compared with devices made from other anti-solvent methods. Our findings provide a novel recipe to prepare efficient and photostable wide-bandgap PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric, Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation via Sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merger of hydrogen atom transfer and Sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement enables the asymmetric arylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in remote position to the double bond under photoredox conditions. Various chiral &#945;&#8208;arylated amides are obtained with up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er where the sulfinamido groups dictates the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
An efficient asymmetric remote arylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under photoredox conditions is described here. The reaction features the addition radicals to a double bond followed by a site&#8208;selective radical translocation (1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer) as well as a stereocontrolled aryl migration via sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement furnishing a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;arylated amides with up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er. Mechanistic studies indicate that the sulfinamide group governs the stereochemistry of the product with the aryl migration being the rate determining step preceded by a kinetically favored 1,n&#8208;HAT process.

         <title>Tapcin, an In Vivo Active Dual Topoisomerase I/II Inhibitor Discovered by Synthetic Bioinformatic Natural Product (Syn&#8208;BNP)&#8208;Coupled Metagenomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling sequence&#8208;tag&#8208;based metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and total chemical synthesis we discovered the synthetic bioinformatic natural product tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid&#8208;thiazole with a rare tri&#8208;thiazole substructure. It has topoisomerase&#8197;I and II activity and exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
DNA topoisomerases are attractive targets for anticancer agents. Dual topoisomerase&#8197;I/II inhibitors are particularly appealing due to their reduced rates of resistance. A number of therapeutically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors are bacterial natural products. Mining the untapped chemical diversity encoded by soil microbiomes presents an opportunity to identify additional natural topoisomerase inhibitors. Here we couple metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and chemical synthesis to produce the dual topoisomerase inhibitor tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;thiazole with a rare tri&#8208;thiazole substructure and picomolar antiproliferative activity. Tapcin reduced colorectal adenocarcinoma HT&#8208;29&#8197;cell proliferation and tumor volume in mouse hollow fiber and xenograft models, respectively. In both studies it showed similar activity to the clinically used topoisomerase&#8197;I inhibitor irinotecan. The study suggests that the interrogation of soil microbiomes using synthetic bioinformatic natural product methods has the potential to be a rewarding strategy for identifying potent, biomedically relevant, antiproliferative agents.

         <title>Visualizing and Regulating Dynamic Evolution of Interfacial Electrolyte Configuration during De&#8208;solvation Process on Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ FTIR and in situ MRI are employed to reveal the interfacial electrolyte configuration dynamic variation on Li&#8208;metal anode. During Li plating (de&#8208;solvation process), an anion&#8208;lean solvent&#8208;rich interface is revealed, which determines the SEI architecture.







Abstract
Acting as a passive protective layer, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the Li&#8208;metal anode. Derived from the reductive decomposition of electrolytes (e.g., anion and solvent), the SEI construction presents as an interfacial process accompanied by the dynamic de&#8208;solvation process during Li&#8208;metal plating. However, typical electrolyte engineering and related SEI modification strategies always ignore the dynamic evolution of electrolyte configuration at the Li/electrolyte interface, which essentially determines the SEI architecture. Herein, by employing advanced electrochemical in situ FT&#8208;IR and MRI technologies, we directly visualize the dynamic variations of solvation environments involving Li+&#8208;solvent/anion. Remarkably, a weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interaction and anion&#8208;lean interfacial electrolyte configuration have been synchronously revealed, which is difficult for the fabrication of anion&#8208;derived SEI layer. Moreover, as a simple electrochemical regulation strategy, pulse protocol was introduced to effectively restore the interfacial anion concentration, resulting in an enhanced LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer and improved Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping reversibility.

         <title>Regulating Charge Transport Dynamics at the Buried Interface and Bulk of Perovskites by Tailored&#8208;phase Two&#8208;dimensional Crystal Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional crystal seed layer has been developed to optimize the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. The corresponding solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.58&#8201;%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4&#8201;% of initial efficiency being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8197;h in air.







Abstract
Targeting the trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation occurring at the interface and bulk of perovskite, especially the overlooked buried bottom interface, a strategy of tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional (TP&#8208;2D) crystal seed layer has been developed to improve the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and bulk of perovskite films. Using this approach, TP&#8208;2D layer constructed by TP&#8208;2D crystal seeds at the buried interface can induce the formation of homogeneous interface electric field, which effectively suppress the accumulation of charge carriers at the buried interface. Additionally, the presence of TP&#8208;2D crystal seed has a positive effect on the crystallization process of the upper perovskite film, leading to optimized crystal quality and thus promoted charge transport inside bulk perovskites. Ultimately, the best performing PSCs based on TP&#8208;2D layer deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.58&#8201;%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4&#8201;% of their initial PCEs being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8197;h in air. Our findings reveal how to regulate the charge transport dynamics of perovskite bulk and interface by introducing homogeneous components.

This P2/P3 intergrown layered composite can manifest a high energy density of 321&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and also exhibit excellent capacity preservation during 600&#8197;cycles of K+ uptake/release.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides are extensively considered as appealing cathode candidates for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their abundant raw materials and low cost, but their further implementations are limited by slow dynamics and impoverished structural stability. Herein, a layered composite having a P2 and P3 symbiotic structure is designed and synthesized to realize PIBs with large energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The unique intergrowth of P2 and P3 phases in the obtained layered oxide is plainly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction refinement, high&#8208;angle annular dark field and annular bright field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy at atomic resolution, and Fourier transformation images. The synergistic effect of the two phases of this layered P2/P3 composite is well demonstrated in K+ intercalation/extraction process. The as&#8208;prepared layered composite can present a large discharge capacity with the remarkable energy density of 321&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and also manifest excellent capacity preservation after 600&#8197;cycles of K+ uptake/removal.

         <title>Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Amination of Isochromans and Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines have been developed by employing molecular editing strategy. This chemistry offers a practical method to access various valuable compounds from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
The molecular structure&#8208;editing through selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage allows for the precise modification of molecular structures and opens up new possibilities in chemical synthesis. By strategically cleaving C&#8722;C bonds and editing the molecular structure, more efficient and versatile pathways for the synthesis of complex compounds could be designed, which brings significant implications for drug development and materials science. o&#8208;Aminophenethyl alcohols and amines are the essential key motifs in bioactive and functional material molecules. The traditional synthesis of these compounds usually requires multiple steps which could generate inseparable isomers and induce low efficiencies. By leveraging a molecular editing strategy, we herein reported a selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines for the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;aminophenethyl alcohols and amines. This innovative chemistry allows for the precise cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds under mild transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, further synthetic application demonstrated that our method could provide an efficient approach to essential components of diverse bioactive molecules.

         <title>Dipolar Chemical Bridge Induced CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with 21.86&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible dipolar chemical bridge is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower the photovoltage deficits of perovskite solar cells. The functional molecules could firmly anchor to the TiO2 surface and chemically bond with the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral frameworks of perovskites to ameliorate the interfacial disorder and facilitate charge transport, leading to the perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.86&#8201;% being realized.







Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite receives tremendous attention for photovoltaic applications due to its ideal band gap and good thermal stability. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly suffer from photovoltage deficits because of serious interfacial energy losses within the PSCs, which to a large extent affects the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Herein, a dipolar chemical bridge (DCB) is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower interfacial energy losses and thus improve the charge extraction of PSCs. The results reveal that the DCB could form a beneficial interfacial dipole between the perovskite and TiO2 layers, which could optimize the interfacial energetics of perovskite/TiO2 layers and thus improve the energy level alignment within the PSCs. Meanwhile, the constructed DCB could also simultaneously passivate the surface defects of perovskite and TiO2 layers, greatly lowering interfacial recombination. Consequently, the photovoltage deficit of CsPbI3 PSCs is largely reduced, leading to a record efficiency of 21.86&#8201;% being realized. Meanwhile, the operation stability of PSCs is also largely improved due to the high&#8208;quality perovskite films with released interfacial tensile strain being obtained after forming the DCB within the PSCs.

         <title>Rationally Designed Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) that considers the directions of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, the charge transfer position and the O2 adsorption sites provides feasible access for the construction of efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway.







Abstract
Constructing stable and efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production is of great importance and is challenging. In this study, the synthesis of three photoactive cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) in an alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) fashion is presented. In combination with a triazine&#8208;derived electron acceptor, PAF&#8208;363 exhibits high efficiency for the photosynthesis of H2O2 with production rates of 11733&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1(with sacrificial agent) and 3930&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (without sacrificial agent) from water and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer positions and the O2 adsorption sites in PAF&#8208;363 are both concentrated on COTh fragments, which facilitate the H2O2 production through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. This work highlights that the rational design of COTh&#8208;PAFs with consideration of D&#8722;A direction, charge transfer positions, and O2 adsorption sites provides a feasible access to efficient H2O2 production photocatalysts.

         <title>Unlocking Double Redox Reaction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, a co&#8208;insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and H+ is demonstrated accompanying with manganese and oxygen double redox reactions in Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 cathode. As a result, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability in the electrolyte of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) show wide application as the cathode of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) in the future owning to their high porosity, diverse structures, abundant species, and controllable morphology. However, the low energy density and poor cycling stability hinder the feasibility in practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed and demonstrated to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, its energy storage mechanism is systematically investigated. Moreover, profiting from the coordination effect, the Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 features with stable structure in ZnSO4 electrolyte. Therefore, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability. This work aids in the future development of MOFs in AZIBs.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Labile Polyoxometalates for Catalysis in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of labile polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solutions has been achieved within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble coordination cage. This encapsulation significantly enhances the stability of these POMs in water, rendering them into green catalysts with high reactivity and selectivity. This cavity&#8208;directed approach represents the first example of utilizing the coordination cage for synthesizing metallic clusters.







Abstract
The artificial microenvironments inside coordination cages have gained significant attention for performing enzyme&#8208;like catalytic reactions by facilitating the formation of labile and complex molecules through a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; approach. Despite many fascinating examples, this approach remains scarcely explored in the context of synthesizing metallic clusters such as polyoxometalates (POMs). The development of innovative approaches to control and influence the speciation of POMs in aqueous solutions would greatly advance their applicability and could ultimately lead to the formation of elusive clusters that cannot be synthesized by using traditional methods. In this study, we employ host&#8211;guest stabilization within a coordination cage to enable a novel cavity&#8208;directed synthesis of labile POMs in aqueous solutions under mild conditions. The elusive Lindqvist [M6O19]2&#8722; (M=Mo or W) POMs were successfully synthesized at room temperature via the condensation of molybdate or tungstate building blocks within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble Pt6L4(NO3)12 coordination cage. Importantly, the encapsulation of these POMs enhances their stability in water, rendering them efficient catalysts for environmentally friendly and selective sulfoxidation reactions using H2O2 as a green oxidant in a pure aqueous medium. The approach developed in this paper offers a means to synthesize and stabilize the otherwise unstable metal&#8208;oxo clusters in water, which can broaden the scope of their applications.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Organogold(III) Complexes Enable High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, based on a through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer motif have been developed to simultaneously exhibit high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. The resulting scintillator screen based on Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 achieves an optimal combination of ultrahigh light yield of 77,600 photons MeV&#8722;1, favorable X&#8208;ray stability, and excellent X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of exceeding 16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Organic scintillators have recently attracted growing attention for X&#8208;ray detection in industrial and medical applications. However, these materials still face critical obstacles of low attenuation efficiency and/or inefficient triplet exciton utilization. Here we developed a new category of organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, through adopting a through&#8208;space interaction motif to realize high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. Thanks to the efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer process, this panel of complexes achieved higher photoluminescence quantum yield and shorter radiative lifetimes compared with the through&#8208;bond reference complexes. Inspiringly, these organogold(III) complexes exhibited polarity&#8208;dependent emission origins: thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 manifested intense radioluminescence together with a record&#8208;high scintillation light yield of 77,600&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1 for organic scintillators. The resulting scintillator screens demonstrated high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with &gt;16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&#8722;1 spatial resolution, outstripping most organic and inorganic scintillators. This finding provides a feasible strategy for the design of superior organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>Bimodal Oxidation Electrochemiluminescence Mechanism of Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks via Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitter (C&#8211;COF) is obtained by covalently linking a covalent organic framework (COF) with a coreactant via a postsynthetic modification strategy, resulting in a 1008&#8208;fold increase in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity compared to the COF with an equivalent external coreactant. Notably, a bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism emerges from the oxidation of the coreactant in the framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) efficiency is determined by charge transfer between coreactants and emitters in coreactant systems, which are usually limited by their slow intermolecular charge transfer. In this study, a covalent organic framework (COF) with aldehyde residue was synthesized, and then coreactants were covalently integrated into the skeleton through the postsynthetic modification strategy, resulting in a crystalline coreactant&#8208;embedded COF nanoemitter (C&#8211;COF). Compared to the pristine COF with an equivalent external coreactant, C&#8211;COF exhibited an extraordinary 1008&#8208;fold enhancement of ECL intensity due to the rapid intrareticular charge transfer. Significantly, with the pH increase, C&#8211;COF shows protonation&#8208;induced ECL enhancement for the first ECL peaked at +1.1&#8197;V and an opposite trend for the second ECL at +1.4&#8197;V, which were attributed to the antedating oxidation of coreactant in framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation, respectively. The resulting bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism was rationalized by spectral characterization and density functional theory calculations. The postsynthetic coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitters present innovative and universal avenues for advancing ECL systems.

         <title>Photocatalytic O&#8208; to S&#8208;Rearrangement of Tertiary Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangement, the development of a photocatalyzed O&#8208; to S&#8208;rearrangement of tertiary thiocarbonyl&#8208;activated cyclopropanol derivatives to access cyclopropanethiols is disclosed. Mechanistic findings enabled a preliminary extension toward other aliphatic alcohol classes. This work is anticipated to inspire new radical approaches to other valuable C(sp3)&#8722;S derivatives from abundant aliphatic feedstocks.







Abstract
Despite the importance of heteroatom&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives in drug design and organic synthesis, cyclopropanethiols remain critically underexplored. Inspired by the wide use of the Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangement to access valuable thiophenols from phenol feedstocks, we report the development of a photocatalytic approach for efficient ambient temperature aliphatic O&#8208; to S&#8208;rearrangement on tertiary cyclopropanol derivatives. After demonstrating that a range of cyclopropanethiols&#8212;that are difficult to access by other methods&#8212;can be obtained with this strategy, we show that these rearranged products can be easily hydrolyzed and further derivatized. We conclude this study with mechanistic findings that enabled an initial extension of this approach toward other classes of aliphatic alcohols.

         <title>F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Dynamic B&#8722;N bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a reversible capture&#8208;release strategy using dynamic B/N Lewis pairs for the construction of stimulus&#8208;responsive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. RTP of the Lewis acid of BrBA can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base of TPAPy and reactivated by dissociation of the B&#8722;N bond to release BrBA. During this process, RTP properties can be regulated by exposure to HCl and NH3.







Abstract
Recently, stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties have attracted significant attention owing to their potential applications in chemical sensing, anticounterfeiting, and displays. However, molecular design currently lacks systematicity and effectiveness. Herein, we report a capture&#8208;release strategy for the construction of reversible RTP via B/N Lewis pairs. Specifically, the RTP of the Lewis acid of 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (BrBA) can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base, N,N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline (TPAPy), and reactivated by dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds to release BrBA. Reversible RTP is attributed to the exceptional self&#8208;assembly capability of BrBA, whereas the tunable RTP colors are derived from distinct F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes. The potential applications of RTP materials in information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting were also experimentally validated.

&lt;p&gt;We report a reversible capture-release strategy using dynamic B/N Lewis pairs for the construction of stimulus-responsive room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. RTP of the Lewis acid of BrBA can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base of TPAPy and reactivated by dissociation of the B&#8722;N bond to release BrBA. During this process, RTP properties can be regulated by exposure to HCl and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, stimulus-responsive organic materials with room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties have attracted significant attention owing to their potential applications in chemical sensing, anticounterfeiting, and displays. However, molecular design currently lacks systematicity and effectiveness. Herein, we report a capture-release strategy for the construction of reversible RTP via B/N Lewis pairs. Specifically, the RTP of the Lewis acid of 7-bromo-5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracene (BrBA) can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-diphenyl-4-(pyridin-4-yl)aniline (TPAPy), and reactivated by dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds to release BrBA. Reversible RTP is attributed to the exceptional self-assembly capability of BrBA, whereas the tunable RTP colors are derived from distinct F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes. The potential applications of RTP materials in information storage and anti-counterfeiting were also experimentally validated. The capture-release approach proposed in this study offers an effective strategy for designing stimulus-responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helical Nanographenes Bearing Pentagon&#8208;Heptagon Pairs by Stepwise Dehydrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units provides a facile and feasible method for the synthesis of helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs. The presence of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs has proven to be quite effective in modulating the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the resulting nanographenes, including enhanced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
The incorporation of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs into helical nanographenes lacks a facile synthetic route, and the impact of these pairs on chiroptical properties remains unclear. In this study, a method for the stepwise construction of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in helical nanographenes by the dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units was developed. Three helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs were synthesized and characterized using this approach. A wide variation in the molecular geometries and photophysical properties of these helical nanographenes was observed, with changes in the helical length of these structures and the introduction of the pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs. The embedded pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs reduced the oxidation potential of the synthesized helical nanographenes. The high isomerization energy barriers enabled the chiral resolution of the helicene enantiomers. Chiroptical investigations revealed remarkably enhanced circularly polarized luminescence and luminescence dissymmetry factors with an increasing number of the pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs.

         <title>Homochiral &#960;&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled Chirality Imprinting in Conjugated Polymers: Confined Polymerization and Chiral Memory from Scratch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) have garnered increasing research interest for their resemblance to biological helices and intriguing chirality&#8208;related functions. Traditional methods for synthesizing involve decorating achiral conjugated polymer architectures with enantiopure side substituents through complex organic synthesis. Here, we report a new approach: the templated synthesis of unsubstituted OACPs via supramolecularly confined polymerizations of achiral monomers within nanopores of 2D or 3D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs). We show that the chiral &#960;&#8208;rich nanospaces facilitate the in situ enantiospecific polymerization and self&#8208;propagation, akin to nonenzymatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, resulting in chiral imprinting. The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200 oC. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85% ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rim&#8208;Based Binding of Perfluorinated Acids to Pillararenes Purifies Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a rapidly increasing global problem as their widespread use and high stability lead worldwide to water contamination, with significant detrimental health effects.[1] Supramolecular chemistry has been invoked to develop materials geared towards the specific capture of PFAS from water,[2] to reduce the concentration below advisory safety limits (e.g., 70 ng/L for the sum of perfluorooctyl sulfonic acid, PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA). Scale&#8208;up and use in natural waters with high PFAS concentrations has hitherto posed a problem. Here we report a new type of host&#8208;guest interaction between deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8208;P5s) and perfluoroalkyl acids. DAF&#8208;P5 complexes show an unprecedented 1:10 stoichiometry, as confirmed by isothermal calorimetry and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies, and high binding constants (up to 106 M&#8208;1) to various polyfluoroalkyl acids. In addition, non&#8208;fluorinated acids do not hamper this process significantly. Immobilization of DAF&#8208;P5s allows a simple single&#8208;time filtration of PFAS&#8208;contaminated water to reduce the PFOS/PFOA concentration 106 times to 15&#8208;50 ng/L level. The effective and fast (&lt;5 min) orthogonal binding to organic molecules without involvement of fluorinated supramolecular hosts, high breakthrough capacity (90 mg/g), and robust performance (&gt; 10 regeneration cycles without decrease in performance) set a new benchmark in PFAS&#8208;absorbing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Alkyne Metathesis&#8208;mediated Cascade: Synthesis of Benzoxazine Polychiral Polyheterocycles and Discovery of a Novel Pain Blocker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for synthesizing Benzoxazine&#8208;Centered Polychiral Polyheterocycles (BPCPHCs) via an innovative asymmetric carbene&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8208;triggered cascade. Overcoming challenges associated with intricate stereochemistry and multiple chiral centers, the catalytic asymmetric Carbene Alkyne Metathesis&#8208;mediated Cascade (CAMC) is employed using dirhodium catalyst/Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis, ensuring precise stereo control as validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Systematic substrate scope evaluation establishes exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, creating a unique library of BPCPHCs. Pharmacological exploration identifies twelve BPCPHCs as potent Nav ion channel blockers, notably compound 8g. In vivo studies demonstrate that intrathecal injection of 8g effectively reverses mechanical hyperalgesia associated with chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), suggesting a promising therapeutic avenue. Electrophysiological investigations unveil the inhibitory effects of 8g on Nav1.7 currents. Molecular docking, dynamics simulations and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay provide insights into the stable complex formation and favorable binding free energy of 8g with C5aR1. This research represents a significant advancement in asymmetric CAMC for BPCPHCs and unveils BPCPHC 8g as a promising, uniquely acting pain blocker, establishing a C5aR1&#8208;Nav1.7 connection in the context of CIPN.</dc:description>

Monometallic Rh catalysts provide poor oxygenate conversion efficiency, and efforts have been focused on constructing adjacent polymetallic sites; however, the one&#8208;pass yields of C2+ oxygenates over the reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts were mostly &lt;20%. In this study, we constructed a monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 (Rh/UiO&#8208;67) with enhanced proximity to dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles. Unexpectedly, this catalyst exhibited high efficacy for oxygenate synthesis from syngas, giving a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4%, and the one&#8208;pass yield of C2+ oxygenates exceeded 25%. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations further revealed the spontaneous formation of an ensemble of Rh single atoms/dimers (Rh1,2) in the proximity of ultrasmall Rh clusters (Rhn) confined within the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, providing adjacent Rh+&#8208;Rh0 dual sites dynamically during the reaction that promote the relay of the undissociated CHO species to the CHx species.

         <dc:description>We have achieved the first total synthesis of pallamolides A&#8208;E, of which pallamolides B&#8208;E possess intriguing tetracyclic skeletons with novel intramolecular transesterifications. Key transformations include highly diastereoselective sequential Michael additions to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core with simultaneous generation of two quaternary carbon centers, a one&#8208;pot SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8208;enoate cyclization/ketone reduction to generate the key oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade sequence to assemble pallamolides tetracyclic skeletons. Kinetic resolution of ketone 14 via Corey&#8208;Bakshi&#8208;Shibata reduction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of pallamolides A&#8208;E.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large&#8208;scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a NiII/0 catalytic cycle and the pre&#8208;coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.</dc:description>

         <title>Acoustic Levitation Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;density Spherical Nucleic Acid Architectures for Specific SERS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllably regulating the electrostatic bilayer of nanogold colloids is a significant premise for synthesizing spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and building ordered plasmonic architectures. We develop a facile acoustic levitation reactor to universally synthesize SNAs with an ultra&#8208;high density of DNA strands. Results reveal a new mechanism of DNA grafting via acoustic wave that can reconfigure the ligands on colloidal surfaces. The acoustic levitation reactor enables substrate&#8208;free three&#8208;dimentional (3D) spatial assembly of SNAs with controllable interparticle nanogaps through regulating DNA lengths.  This kind of architecture may overcome the plasmonic enhancement limits by blocking electron tunneling and breaking electrostatic shielding in dried aggregations. Finite element simulations support the architecture with 3D spatial plasmonic hotspot matrix, and its ultrahigh surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) capability is evidenced by in&#8208;situ untargeted tracking of biomolecular events during photothermal stimulation (PTS)&#8208;induced cell death process. For biomarker diagnosis, the conjugation of ATP aptamer onto SNAs enables in&#8208;situ targeted tracking of ATP during PTS&#8208;induced cell death process. Particularly, the CD71 receptor and integrin &#945;3&#946;1 protein on PL45 cell could be well distinguished by label&#8208;free SERS fingerprints when using specific XQ&#8208;2d and DML&#8208;7 aptamers, respectively. Our current acoustic levitation reactor promises great potentials in biochemical synthesis and sensing in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Diluted Active Sites of Ultrasmall High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poisoning of undesired intermediates or impurities greatly hinders the catalytic performances of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics i&#8208;(PtPdIrRu)2FeCu (HEI) are constructed to inhibit the strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates (CO*) during the formic acid oxidation reaction. As probed by multiple&#8208;scaled structural characterizations, HEI nanoparticles are featured with partially negative Pt oxidation states, diluted Pt/Pd/Ir/Ru atomic sites and ultrasmall average size less than 2 nm. Benefiting from the optimized structures, HEI nanoparticles deliver more than 10 times promotion in intrinsic activity than that of pure Pt, and well&#8208;enhanced mass activity/durability than that of ternary i&#8208;Pt2FeCu intermetallics counterpart. In situ infrared spectroscopy manifests that both bridge and top CO* are favored on pure Pt but limited on HEI. Further theoretical elaboration indicates that HEI displayed a much weaker binding of CO* on Pt sites and sluggish diffusion of CO* among different sites, in contrast to pure Pt that CO* bound more strongly and was easy to diffuse on larger Pt atomic ensembles. This work verifies that HEIs are promising catalysts via integrating the merits of intermetallics and high&#8208;entropy alloys.</dc:description>

         <title>Postsynthetically Modified Alkoxide&#8208;Exchanged Ni2(OR)2BTDD: Synergistic Interactions of CO2 with Open Metal Sites and Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Postsynthetic modifications (PSMs) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in enhancing material performance through open metal site (OMS) functionalization or ligand exchange. However, a significant challenge persists in preserving open metal sites during ligand exchange, as these sites are inherently bound by incoming ligands. In this study, for the first time, we introduced alkoxides by exchanging bridging chloride in Ni2Cl2BTDD (BTDD = bis (1H&#8208;1,2,3,&#8208;triazolo [4,5&#8208;b],&#8208;[4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;i]) dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) through PSM. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data indicated that the alkoxide oxygen atom bridges Ni(II) centers while the OMSs of the MOF are preserved. Due to the synergy of the existing OMS and introduced functional group, the alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed CO2 uptakes superior to the pristine MOF. Furthermore, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for Ni_T suggested that CO2 interacts with the OMS and the surrounding methyl groups of tert&#8208;butoxide groups, which is responsible for the enhanced CO2 capacity. This work provides a facile and unique synthetic strategy for realizing a desirable OMS&#8208;incorporating MOF platform through bridging ligand exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of MOF&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Oxide Solid Solution Anchored with Au Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas and C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1). According to the control experiments and theoretical calculations, the strong interaction between bimetallic oxide solid solution support and Au nanoparticles was found to be beneficial for binding intermediates and reducing CO2 reduction, highlighting the synergy effect of the catalytic system with multiple active sites.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal-organic framework-derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1).

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Linkage Chemistry and Its Critical Role in The Evolution of &#960; Electronic Structures and Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a molecular platform for designing a novel class of functional materials with well&#8208;defined structures. A crucial structural parameter is the linkage, which dictates how knot and linker units are connected to form two&#8208;dimensional polymers and layer frameworks, shaping ordered &#960;&#8208;array and porous architectures. However, the roles of linkage in the development of ordered &#960; electronic structures and functions remain fundamental yet unresolved issues. Here we report the designed synthesis of COFs featuring four representative linkages: hydrazone, imine, azine, and C=C bonds, to elucidate their impacts on the evolution of &#960; electronic structures and functions. Our observations revealed that the hydrazone linkage provides a non&#8208;conjugated connection, while imine and azine allow partial &#960; conjugation, and the C=C bond permits full &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Importantly, the linkage profoundly influences the control of &#960; electronic structures and functions, unraveling its pivotal role in determining key electronic properties such as bandgap, frontier energy levels, light absorption, luminescence, carrier density and mobility, and magnetic permeability. These findings highlight the significance of linkage chemistry in COFs and offer a general and transformative guidance for designing framework materials to achieve electronic functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Tailoring Molecular Structures of Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs) are ideal materials for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most current design strategies for tailoring the molecular structures of HTMs are limited to single strategy. Herein, four HTMs based on dithienothiophenepyrrole (DTTP) core are devised through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering. DTTP&#8208;ThSO with ester alkyl chain that can form six&#8208;membered ring by the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent conformation lock with thiophene in the backbone shows good planarity, high&#8208;quality film, matching energy level and high hole mobility, as well as strong defect passivation ability. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% with a nice long&#8208;term stability is achieved by dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs, representing one of the highest values for un&#8208;doped organic HTMs based PSCs. Especially, the fill factor (FF) of 82.3% is the highest value for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs to date. Moreover, DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based devices have achieved an excellent PCE of 20.9% in large&#8208;area (1.01 cm2) devices. This work clearly elucidates the structure&#8208;performance relationships of HTMs and offers a practical dual&#8208;strategy approach to designing dopant&#8208;free HTMs for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis for Electrochemical Chlorination and Nitration of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique biphasic electrochemical reaction, wherein tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts play a dual role as both electrolyte and phase transfer catalysts, was developed to furnish chlorination and nitration of aromatic compounds using cheap inorganic salts with up to 98&#8201;% yield, shorter reaction time and higher Faradaic efficiency.







Abstract
A biphasic anodic oxidation method for aromatic halogenation process was developed, where aqueous metal salts were directly used as halogen source. Ammonium salts serve as both electrolytes and phase transfer catalysis to facilitate anion transport and oxidative transformation. This design allows for chlorination or nitration of multiple types of arenes using NaCl or KNO2.

         <title>Breaking Global Diatropic Current to Tame Diradicaloid Character: Thiele's Hydrocarbon Under Macrocyclic Constraints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two p&#8208;phenylene units with dissimilar resonance character (benzene and quinone) are embedded in a macrocyclic system. Their mutual orientation, in terms of the dihedral angle between the carbocyclic units, can stabilize the diradicaloid character of the system. Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analysis confirmed a presence of open&#8208;shell singlet state with a low &#916;EST of &#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
A diradical/biradical character of organic derivatives is one of the key aspects of contemporary research focusing on the fundamental studies followed by potential applicability relying on the unique optical, electronic, or magnetic properties assigned to unpaired electrons. A precise involvement of two p&#8208;phenylenes into a cyclophane&#8208;like conjugated, diatropic system creates a flexible molecule with the two different characters of both subunits (benzene and quinone) imprinting into the structure a Kekul&#233; delocalized system. A dynamic of both carbocyclic subunits, and their mutual interaction generates a singlet open&#8208;shell state (J=&#8722;1.25&#8197;kcal/mol) as documented spectroscopically (NMR and EPR). The extended theoretical analysis has proved a correlation between dihedral angle and the diradicaloid character that shifts from a closed&#8208;shell singlet to an open&#8208;shell state, eventually showing the y0=0.86 for 78&#8197;degrees and &#916;EST=&#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Dienes as Versatile Substrates for Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienes are valued for their abundance, ease of preparation, and unique properties, as they play a crucial role in synthesizing complex, bioactive molecules. This review focuses on the past decade's advances and challenges in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving diene substrates, emphasizing their versatility and the emergence of novel reactivity patterns.







Abstract
Dienes have been of great interest to synthetic chemists as valuable substrates due to their abundance and ease of synthesis. Their unique stereoelectronic properties enable broad reactivity with a wide range of transition metals to construct molecular complexity facilitating synthesis of biologically active compounds. In addition, structural diene variation can result in substrate&#8208;controlled reactions, providing valuable mechanistic insights into reactivity and selectivity patterns. The last decade has seen a wealth of new methodologies involving diene substrates through the power of transition metal catalysis. This review summarizes recent advances and remaining opportunities for transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving dienes.

         <title>Binding FSI&#8722; to Construct a Self&#8208;Healing SEI Film for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries by In situ Crosslinking Vinyl Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing SEI film containing bound FSI&#8722; anions as repairing agent is constructed via the cross&#8208;linking of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) to improve the performances of lithium anode. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li.







Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane on the Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self&#8208;healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li&#8208;electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film&#8208;forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self&#8208;healing film fixing FSI&#8722; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li. This study presents a new design approach for self&#8208;healing Li metal anodes and durable lithium metal battery.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Principinol B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of principinol B was achieved by convergent and modular synthetic strategies. Two enantioenriched fragments were assembled by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction/carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis sequence. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] core structure was introduced by the Williamson ether synthesis.







Abstract
We have accomplished the first and asymmetric total synthesis of principinol B, a grayanoid possessing an oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture. A functionalized 5/7/6/5 tetracyclic intermediate was assembled in a convergent manner by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and subsequent carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture containing a 6,10&#8208;ether bridge was constructed by the Williamson ether synthesis.

         <title>MoS2 Hollow Multishelled Nanospheres Doped Fe Single Atoms Capable of Fast Phase Transformation for Fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time, which promotes the electron transfer and Na+ diffusion kinetic, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. Besides, the strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S, combining buffering effect of HoMS to improve the cyclic stability.







Abstract
Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple&#8208;shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to previously&#8208;reported results. Even at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 259.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (83.68&#8201;%) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other &#8220;fast&#8208;charging&#8221; high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Integrating Olefin Carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag Reaction by Radical Deconstruction of Hydrazonyl N&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel conversion mode for hydrazone by the division use of N2&#8208;moiety is developed by the photocatalytic redox neutral reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl&#8208;N&#8208;mesitylenesulfonyl (Mts)&#8208;hydrazones with ICF2CO2Et. The reaction merges olefin carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) reaction by radical addition/crucial distal N and H transfer sequences to yield &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters under tandem C&#8722;C and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.







Abstract
As a type of elementary organic compounds containing N&#8722;N single bond, hydrazone involved chemical conversions are extremely extensive, but they are mainly limited to N2&#8208;retention and N2&#8208;removal modes. We report herein an unprecedented protocol for the realization of division utilization of the N2&#8208;moiety of hydrazone by a radical facilitated N&#8722;N bond deconstruction strategy. This new conversion mode enables the successful combination of alkene carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction by the reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl mesitylenesulfonyl hydrazones with ethyl difluoroiodoacetate under photocatalytic redox neutral conditions. Mechanism studies reveal that the reaction undergoes a radical relay involving addition, crucial remote imino&#8208;N migration and H&#8208;atom transfer. Consequently, a series of structurally significant &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters are efficiently produced via continuous C&#8722;C bond and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.

     alt="Integrating Olefin Carboamination and Hofmann-L&#246;ffler-Freytag Reaction by Radical Deconstruction of Hydrazonyl N&#8722;N Bond"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel conversion mode for hydrazone by the division use of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-moiety is developed by the photocatalytic redox neutral reaction of N-homoallyl-N-mesitylenesulfonyl (Mts)-hydrazones with ICF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et. The reaction merges olefin carboamination and Hofmann-L&#246;ffler-Freytag (HLF) reaction by radical addition/crucial distal N and H transfer sequences to yield &#1013;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulphonamide-&#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#947;-amino acid esters under tandem C&#8722;C and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a type of elementary organic compounds containing N&#8722;N single bond, hydrazone involved chemical conversions are extremely extensive, but they are mainly limited to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-retention and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-removal modes. We report herein an unprecedented protocol for the realization of division utilization of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-moiety of hydrazone by a radical facilitated N&#8722;N bond deconstruction strategy. This new conversion mode enables the successful combination of alkene carboamination and Hofmann-L&#246;ffler-Freytag reaction by the reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-homoallyl mesitylenesulfonyl hydrazones with ethyl difluoroiodoacetate under photocatalytic redox neutral conditions. Mechanism studies reveal that the reaction undergoes a radical relay involving addition, crucial remote imino-N migration and H-atom transfer. Consequently, a series of structurally significant &#1013;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulphonamide-&#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#947;-amino acid esters are efficiently produced via continuous C&#8722;C bond and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predicting Lewis Acidity: Machine Learning the Fluoride Ion Affinity of p&#8208;Block&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoride ion affinity (FIA) is among the most prominent descriptors for Lewis acidity. This paper presents FIA&#8208;GNN, a machine learning model that predicts FIA values in gas and solution (CH2Cl2) phase within a fraction of a second on a standard personal laptop. This is several orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional quantum chemical approach. FIA&#8208;GNN is applied in four different case studies including catalysis research.







Abstract
&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI&#8208;DSD&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c level of theory, including 13 different p&#8208;block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA&#8208;GNN, two message&#8208;passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (r2=0.93) from the SMILES string of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 spanned by FIA49k. The model's value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA&#8208;GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (grebgroup.de/fia&#8208;gnn).

         <title>Catalytic and Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls via a Cyclic Iodonium Ylide Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls have been developed, providing expedient access toward a wide range of high&#8208;value 2&#8208;aryl (hetero)cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls. The key to success is through a cyclic iodonium ylide strategy. Our approach is base&#8208;free and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Importantly, our approach allows late&#8208;stage modification and significantly simplifying previous synthesis.







Abstract
To date, it remains challenging to achieve a general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, particularly ubiquitous heteroaromatic ones. In most cases, the preparation of their medically significant arylated derivatives requires multistep synthetic sequences. Herein, we introduce a new, convenient strategy involving the conversion of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to cyclic iodonium ylides (CIYs), followed by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation with arylboronic reagents via carbene coupling. This approach is mild, operationally simple, base&#8208;free, biocompatible, and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples), especially with respect to various heteroaromatic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and ortho&#8208;substituted or base&#8208;sensitive arylboronic acids. Importantly, owing to the excellent compatibility with various arylboronic acids or boronate esters (ArBpin, ArBneop, or ArBF3K), this method allows the late&#8208;stage installation of heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs in highly complex settings. The utility of this transformation is further demonstrated through significantly simplifying the synthesis of several bioactive molecules and natural products.

         <title>Precisely Patterned Channels in a Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor with a Diazirine Photo&#8208;Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted interest in the field of neuromorphic devices and implantable electronics due to their excellent characteristics. Here, we use small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinkers double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirine (DtFDA) to precisely pattern the channel layer and modulate ion transport in OECTs to fabricate high&#8208;performance vertical electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) rely on both efficient ionic doping/de&#8208;doping process and carrier transport in the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic channel under the modulation of gate bias. Moreover, channels that hold photopatterning capability are highly desired to minimize parasitic capacitance and simplify the fabrication process/cost. However, yielding photo&#8208;patternable channels with both precise/robust patterning capability and controllable ionic&#8208;electronic coupling is still challenging. Herein, double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirines (DtFDA) with different chain lengths are introduced in the OECT channel to act as both photo&#8208;crosslinker and medium to regulate ionic&#8208;electronic transport. Specifically, high&#8208;resolution patterns with a minimum line width/gap of 2&#8197;&#956;m are realized in p(g2T&#8208;T) or Homo&#8208;gDPP based channels by introducing DtFDA. Maximum transconductances of 68.6&#8197;mS and 81.6&#8197;mS, current on/off ratio of 106 and 107 (under a drain voltage of only &#177;0.1&#8197;V), are achieved in p&#8208; and n&#8208;type vertical OECTs (vOECTs), respectively, along with current densities exceeding 1&#8197;kA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles (2000&#8197;seconds). This work provides a new and facile strategy for the fabrication of vOECT channels with high resolution and high performance via the introduction of a simple and efficient crosslinker.

         <title>Stable&#160;Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange conductivity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x&#160;was verified and retained in the ex&#8208;situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ&#8208;5 was used in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based AEM&#8208;WE, achieving a high current density of 8 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V and excellent stability over 2446 h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl&#8208;quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi&#8208;topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Bypassing Ammonia: From N2 to Nitrogen Heterocycles without N1 Intermediates or Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboradiazido compounds, derived in one step from the boron&#8208;mediated reduction of dinitrogen (N2), were treated separately with sulfur and acetic anhydride, providing heterocyclic compounds that are BN isosteres of thiophene and 1,3&#8208;oxazole, respectively. These simple reactions represent the final steps in two&#8208;step routes to complex heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating and stabilizing a reversible four electron redox reactions of I&#8208;/I+ for aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;Iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8208; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;I LDH nanoflowers served as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8208;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxide Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions&#160;for Abundant Production of Mugineic Acids and Nicotianamine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A succinct synthetic approach to mugineic acids and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established.&#160;Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8208;N bonds and is characterized by the absence of redox reactions.&#160;Mugineic acid was synthesized from three readily available fragments on a gram scale in 6 steps. The protected 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was also synthesized in 4 steps, and the dansyl group, serving as a fluorophore, was introduced through a click reaction after propargylation of the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy group. The dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were&#160;internalized by oocytes overexpressing ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human) transporters, indicating successful transport of the synthesized NA&#8208;probe through these&#160;transporters.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S.&#160;aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of Polysulfide Surfaces with Low&#8208;Power Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano&#8208;, bio&#8208; and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low&#8208;cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low&#8208;power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786 nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Metabolic Glycosylation Reporters Enable Detection of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in Living Cells without S&#8208;Glyco Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non&#8208;specific protein labeling termed S&#8208;glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene&#8208;modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O&#8208;GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S&#8208;glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioethyl&#8208;protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein&#8208;specific detection of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein&#8208;specific imaging of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Delivery of Charged Species using Ion&#8208;selective Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled release systems have gained considerable attention owing to their potential to deliver molecules, including ions and drugs, in a customized manner. We present a light&#8208;induced ion&#8208;transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300 nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)&#8208;selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, each NP can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0&#160;and doped POT+&#160;coexist in the core, allowing K+&#160;encapsulation in the shell. As POT0&#160;is photo&#8208;oxidized to POT+, K+&#160;is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality. This process is reversible and can be assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0&#160;and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.</dc:description>

We present a light-induced ion-transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300 nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)-selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, each NP can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0&#160;and doped POT+&#160;coexist in the core, allowing K+&#160;encapsulation in the shell. As POT0&#160;is photo-oxidized to POT+, K+&#160;is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality. This process is reversible and can be assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0&#160;and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Phenol Derivatives over Bismuth&#8208;Based Porous Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective oxidative coupling of phenol derivatives, involving carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) and carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8208;O) bond formation, has emerged as a critical approach in the synthesis of natural products. However, achieving precise control over the selectivity in coupling reactions of unsubstituted phenols utilizing solar light as the driving force remains a big challenge. In this study, we report a series of porous Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) photocatalysts with tailored bandgaps and compositions engineered for efficient solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol coupling. Notably, p&#8208;Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited about 73 % selectivity for C&#8208;C coupling, displaying a high formation rate of 47.3 &#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8209;1 under solar radiation. Furthermore, this approach enables control of the site&#8208;selectivity for phenol derivatives on Cs3Bi2X9, enhancing C&#8208;C coupling. The distinctive porous structure and appropriate band&#8208;edge positions of Cs3Bi2Br9 facilitated efficient charge separation, and surface interaction/activation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, resulting in the kinetically preferred formation of C&#8208;C over C&#8208;O bond. Mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway, supported by comprehensive control experiments, unveiled the crucial role of interfacial charge transfers and Lewis acid Bi sites in stabilizing phenolic intermediates, thereby directing the regioselectivity of diradical couplings and resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical biphenols.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Ni&#8208;W Dimer Sites Induced Stable Compressive Strain for Boosting the Performance of&#160;Pt as Electrocatalyst&#160;for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying Pt catalysts with transition metal elements is an effective pathway to enhance the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but often accompanied with severe metal dissolution issue, resulting in poor stability of alloy catalysts. Here, instead of forming traditional alloy structure, we modify Pt surface with a novel Ni&#8208;W dimer structure by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The obtained NiW@PtC catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance both in liquid half&#8208;cell and practical fuel cell compared with initial Pt/C. It is discovered that strong synergistic Ni&#8208;W dimer structure arising from short atomic distance induced a stable compressive strain on the Pt surface, thus boosting Pt catalytic performance. This surface modification by synergistic dimer sites offers an effective strategy in tailoring Pt with excellent activity and stability, which provides a significant perspective in boosting the performance of commercial Pt catalyst modified with polymetallic atom sites.</dc:description>

         <title>The Use of Xenonucleic Acids Significantly Reduces the In Vivo Drift of Electrochemical Aptamer&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based sensors support the high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. Achieving this requires methods for correcting the sensor drift seen during in vivo placements. While this correction ensures EAB sensor measurements remain accurate, as drift progresses it reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and precision. Here, we show that enzymatic cleavage of the sensor&#8217;s target&#8208;recognizing DNA aptamer is a major source of this signal loss. To demonstrate this, we deployed a tobramycin&#8208;detecting EAB sensor analog fabricated with the DNase&#8208;resistant &#8220;xenonucleic acid&#8221; 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA in a live rat. In contrast to the sensor employing the equivalent DNA aptamer, the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA aptamer sensor lost very little signal and had improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise. We further characterized the EAB sensor drift using unstructured DNA or 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA oligonucleotides. While the two devices drift similarly in vitro in whole blood, the in vivo drift of the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA&#8208;employing device is less compared to the DNA&#8208;employing device. Studies of the electron transfer kinetics suggested that the greater drift of the latter sensor arises due to enzymatic DNA degradation. These findings, coupled with advances in the selection of aptamers employing XNA, suggest a means of improving EAB sensor stability when they are used to perform molecular monitoring in the living body.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem device and indoor photovoltaic. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide bandgap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10:HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% with a VOC of 1.232 V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02%, VOC=1.197 V). Notably, PTQ10:HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54% with a VOC of 1.201 V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and VOC, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.</dc:description>
