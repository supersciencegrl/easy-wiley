      <title>Tuning of delicate&#160;host&#8208;guest interaction in hydrated MIL&#8208;53 and functional variants for furfural&#160;capture from aqueous&#160;solution</title>
      <dc:description>Capture of&#160;high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point furfural from diluted aqueous solution is a critical but&#160;challenging step in sustainable bio&#8208;refinery processes, but conventional&#160;separation methods such as distillation and liquid&#8208;liquid extraction requires&#160;prohibitive energy consumption. We report control over the microenvironment of&#160;hydrated MIL&#8208;53 and isoreticular&#160;variants with diversified functional&#160;terephthalic acid linkers for the purpose of preferential binding of furfural&#160;through&#160;delicate host&#8208;guest interactions. Methyl&#8208;bounded MIL&#8208;53 with improved&#160;binding energy in the hydrated form results in&#160;highly efficient capture ratio&#160;(~98%) in the extremely low concentration of furfural solution (0.5&#8208;3 wt.%) and&#160;100%&#160;furfural specificity over xylose. The distinct hydrogen bonding sites and&#160;multiple Van de Wall interactions for furfural&#160;adsorption was testified by&#160;computational modeling. Furthermore,&#160;the recovery ratio&#160;of furfural reaches ~93% in&#160;desorption,&#160;holding promise for practical&#160;capture of furfural as one of the most important chemical building blocks&#160;derived&#160;from biomass.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly thermostable and efficient formamidinium&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells</title>
      <dc:description>Currently, most two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal halide perovskites are of the Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper type and contain the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecules, which leads to inferior photovoltaic performance and mild stability. Here we report a new type of MA&#8208;free formamidinium (FA) based 2D Dion&#8208;Jacobson phase perovskites, featuring a general formula of (PDA)(FA)  n&#8208;1  Pb  n  I  3n+1  with propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium (PDA) as the organic spacer cation. The 2D perovskite films with well&#8208;oriented crystal grains are attained under the assistance of the FACl additive, where the role of Cl is investigated through the grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. The photovoltaic device based on the optimized (PDA)(FA)  3  Pb  4  I  13  film demonstrates a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 13.8%, the highest record for the FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells. In addition, compared to (PDA)(MA)  3  Pb  4  I  13  , the MA&#8208;containing analogue and a renowned stable 2D perovskite, both the (PDA)(FA)  3  Pb  4  I  13  films and their derived devices exhibit exceedingly higher thermal stability.</dc:description>

When appropriate diastereomeric biaryl diphosphite ligands are applied, the same starting materials can be converted to either linear or branched nitriles with good yields and high regioselectivities.

      <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;Driven Extraction of Bioreceptors into Polymeric Membranes for Label&#8208;Free Potentiometric Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>We report here on a novel concept of a magnetically&#8208;controlled extraction of hydrophilic bioreceptors into polymeric membranes for bioassays. The potentiometric assay relies on the intrinsic charges of an antimicrobial peptide and its unique recognition abilities, which can eliminate the probe labelling and indicator addition. The target binding event could effectively prevent the extraction of the peptide into the polymeric membrane doped with an ion exchanger, thus resulting in a potential change. The potentiometric response properties of the peptide assembled on magnetic beads can be dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field.  Staphylococcus aureus  , as a model of food&#8208;borne pathogens, was measured at levels down to 10 CFU mL  &#8208;1  . Based on this sensing strategy, a potentiometric array was developed for the pattern recognition of bacteria. The proposed generic platform can be used for potentiometric biosensing using other hydrophilic bioreceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantifying Planarity in Design of Organic Electronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular design is the cornerstone for the success of organic electronics and a broad scope of chemical structures have been explored toward that goal. Planarity is an essential attribute for many organic electronic materials as it maximizes the intramolecular &#960;&#8208;orbital overlap and enables efficient intermolecular interactions through &#960;&#8208;stacking. In this paper, we propose a statistical way of quantifying the planarity of a wide range of conjugated systems. The quantification takes into account all torsional conformations and their relative contribution to the overall structural disorder, through a planarity index &lt;cos2&#966;&gt;. The propensity for planarization and the effect of rotational disorder have been examined for a series of commonly used building blocks, and the results are organized in a planarity index table to guide the molecular design process. The application of the analysis to extended conjugated systems and the correlations between the gas&#8208;phase &lt;cos2&#966;&gt; and crystallographically observed planarity in the solid state were explored. Our calculations also reveal a previously unrecognized effect of decreasing bandgap upon deplanarization for conjugated systems coupling strong electron donor and acceptor units.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclized polyacrylonitrile anode for alkali metal ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) ion batteries are vital in portable and large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage. Recently, organic anodes have attracted increasing attention for alkali metal ion batteries due to their chemical diversity and potential high capacity. In this work, we discovered that cyclized polyacrylonitrile (cPAN) can serve as a superior anode for alkali metal ion batteries. Remarkably, upon activation cycling, as an anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery, cPAN exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 1238 mAh g&#8208;1 under a current density of 50 mA g&#8208;1. Based on electrochemical experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the hexagonal carbon ring, piperidine ring, and pyridine nitrogen in ladder cPAN are the main active sites for lithium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, we show that cPAN displays a unique potential&#8208;dependent solid electrolyte interphase formation from 0.1 to 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+. Furthermore, cPAN displays decent performance as an anode in SIBs and PIBs. The discovery of cPAN anode could pave the way for the future development of organic anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>A Versatile Protocol for Functionalization of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a prevalent and powerful strategy to introduce desired functionalities into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for functional products, expediting their applications vastly.

      <title>Alkali Metal Mediation: Diversity of Applications in Main Group Organometallic Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Organolithium compounds have been at the forefront of synthetic chemistry for over a century, by mediating the synthesis of myriads of compounds, utilised worldwide across academic and industrial settings. For that reason, lithium has always been the most important alkali metal in organometallic chemistry. Today, that importance is being seriously challenged by sodium and potassium, as organic alkali metal mediation in general has started branching off in several new directions. Recent examples covering main group homogeneous catalysis, stoichiometric organic synthesis, low valent main group metal chemistry, polymerization and green chemistry are showcased in this review. Since alkali metal compounds are often not the end products of these applications, their roles are rarely given top billing. Thus, this review has been written to alert the community to this rising unifying phenomenon of &#8220;alkali metal mediation&#8221;.</dc:description>

      <title>Host&#8208;Guest Exchange of Viologen Guests in Porphyrin Cage Compounds as Studied by Selective Exchange Spectroscopy (1D EXSY) NMR</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamics in complexes of porphyrin cage compounds and viologen&#8208;derived guest molecules are investigated by selective exchange NMR spectroscopy (1D EXSY). Exchange rates were found to be independent of excess guest concentration, revealing a dissociative exchange mechanism, which is accompanied by negative activation entropies. The latter indicates significant reorganization of the host&#8208;guest complex during dissociation. Dissymmetric viologen guests bearing bulky head groups exhibited more unidirectional binding and slower exchange rates than guests with less bulky head groups. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies revealed that the exchange process is primarily driven by the thermodynamics of binding. Overall, guest binding can be influenced by introducing steric and electronic groups on the host, which for small substituents that make the cavity sidewalls more electron&#8208;rich, results in stronger binding. Exchange studies with guests bearing a polymer chain revealed that both slippage and full dissociation takes place and the rate constants for both processes were determined. The slippage rate constant corresponded to the exchange rate constants of smaller guests, which further revealed that for smaller guests exchange takes place nearly exclusively under thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

      <title>Towards a Single Chemical Model for Understanding Lanthanide Hexaborides</title>
      <dc:description>
Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB6) have a plethora of seemingly mutually incompatible properties. We propose a chemical bonding model that rationalizes the entire LnB6 series. The boron atoms can access different bonding states with the Ln, and in some LnB6 switch between them through phonon motion. The new paradigm allows predictions of new properties of mixed alloys.







Abstract
Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB6) have disparate and often anomalous properties, from structurally homogeneous mixed valency, to superconductivity, spectral anomalies, and unexplained phase transitions. It is unclear how such a diversity of properties may arise in the solids of identical crystal structures and seemingly very similar electronic structures. Building on our previous model for SmB6 (mixed valent, with a peak in specific heat, and pressure induced magnetic phase transitions), we present a unifying dynamic bonding model for LnB6 that explains simultaneously EuB6 (possessing an anomalous peak in specific heat at low T, magnetic phase transitions, and no mixed valency), YbB6 (mixed valent topological insulator), and rather ordinary LaB6. We show that Ln can engage in covalent bonding with boron, and, in some members of the LnB6 family, also easily access alternative bonding states through the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The accessibility, relative energetics, and bonding nature of the states involved dictate the properties.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive hydroarylation of vinyl amides to produce enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;arylbenzamides is reported. The use of a chiral bisimidazoline (BIm) ligand, in combination with diethoxymethylsilane and aryl halides, enables regioselective introduction of aryl groups to the internal position of the olefin, forging a new stereogenic center &#945; to the N atom. The use of neutral reagents and mild reaction conditions provides simple access to pharmacologically relevant motifs present in anticancer, SARS&#8208;CoV PLpro inhibitors and KCNQ channel openers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rapid and Nondestructive Histopathological Analysis for Intraoperative Cancer Diagnosis Using an Enzyme&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe</title>
      <dc:description>Accurate intraoperative histopathological analysis is critical to the tumor surgery. However, conventional methods are labor&#8208; and time&#8208;intensive, which greatly delay the intraoperative decision&#8208;making. Herein, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag  2  S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid and nondestructive histopathological analysis for  ex vivo  and  in vivo  neuroblastoma diagnosis. A&amp;MMP@Ag  2  S&#8208;AF7P displays the negligible fluorescence in normal tissues but is activated quickly by inhibiting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between Ag  2  S QDs and A1094 mediated by MMP14 overexpressed in neuroblastoma, meanwhile, the exposure of the membrane penetrating peptide R9 (TAT&#8208;peptide) results in efficient internalization of nanoprobes in the cancer cells, providing superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) tissue ratio. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobes adequate as rapid diagnostic reagent for incorporation into cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.</dc:description>

      <title>Metallo&#8208;Helicoid with Double Rims: Polymerization Followed by Folding via Intramolecular Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we established a feasible strategy to construct a new type of metallo&#8208;polymer with helicoid&#8208;like structure through the combination of covalent polymerization and intramolecular coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. In the design, a tetratopic monomer (  M  ) was prepared with two terminal alkynes in the outer rim for polymerization, and two terminal terpyridines (TPYs) in the inner rim for subsequent folding by selective intramolecular coordination. Then, the linear covalent polymer (  P  ) was synthesized by polymerization of  M  through Hay&#8208;Glaser homocoupling reaction. Finally, intramolecular coordination interactions between TPYs and Zn(II) folded the backbone of  P  into a right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed metallo&#8208;helicoid (  H  ) with double rims. Due to multiple positive charges on the inner rim of helicoid, double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules (dsDNA) could interact with  H  via electrostatic interactions. Remarkably, dsDNA allowed exclusive formation of  H  with right handedness by means of chiral induction. Furthermore, the interaction with DNA molecules led to the enhancement of luminescent efficiency of  H  through restricted intramolecular motions. The processes of encapsulation of DNA molecules were able to be probed by time&#8208;dependent fluorescent spectroscopy. Our study not only broadened the scope of metallo&#8208; polymer, but also paved a new avenue for the development of host&#8208;guest systems and emissive materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Directing the rate&#8208;enhancement for hydronium ion catalyzed dehydration via organization of alkanols in nanoscopic confinements</title>
      <dc:description>Alkanol dehydration rates catalyzed by hydronium ions are enhanced by the dimensions of steric confinements of zeolite pores as well as by intraporous intermolecular interactions with other alkanols. The higher rates with zeolite MFI having pores smaller than those of zeolite BEA for dehydration of secondary alkanols, 3&#8208;heptanol and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol, is caused by the lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confinements of MFI that offsets a less positive activation entropy. The higher activity in BEA than in MFI for dehydration of a tertiary alkanol, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol, is primarily attributed to the reduction of the activation enthalpy by stabilizing intraporous interactions of the C  &#946;  &#8208;H transition state with surrounding alcohol molecules. Overall, we show that the positive impact of zeolite confinements results from the stabilization of transition state provided by the confinement and intermolecular interaction of alkanols with the transition state, which is impacted by both the size of confines and structure of alkanols in the E1 pathway of dehydration.</dc:description>

The higher rates with zeolite MFI having pores smaller than those of zeolite BEA for dehydration of secondary alkanols, 3&#8208;heptanol and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol, is caused by the lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confinements of MFI that offsets a less positive activation entropy. The higher activity in BEA than in MFI for dehydration of a tertiary alkanol, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol, is primarily attributed to the reduction of the activation enthalpy by stabilizing intraporous interactions of the C  &#946;  &#8208;H transition state with surrounding alcohol molecules. Overall, we show that the positive impact of zeolite confinements results from the stabilization of transition state provided by the confinement and intermolecular interaction of alkanols with the transition state, which is impacted by both the size of confines and structure of alkanols in the E1 pathway of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>In Situ Nanoscale Infrared Spectroscopy of Water Adsorption on Nano&#8208;Islands of Surface&#8208;Anchored Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Despite technological advancements, probing gas&#8208;solid interfaces at the nanoscale is still a formidable challenge. New nano&#8208;spectroscopic methods are needed to understand guest&#8208;host interactions of functional materials during gas sorption, separation, and conversion. Here we introduce  in situ  Photo&#8208;induced Force Microscopy (PiFM) to evidence site&#8208;specific interaction between metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and water. To this end, we developed amphiphilic surface&#8208;anchored MOF (SURMOF) model systems using self&#8208;assembly for the side&#8208;by&#8208;side hetero&#8208;growth of nanodomains of hydrophilic HKUST&#8208;1 and hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8. PiFM was used to probe local uptake kinetics and to show D  2  O sorption isotherms on (defective) HKUST&#8208;1 paddlewheels. By monitoring defect vibrations, we visualized in real&#8208;time the saturation of existing defects and the creation of D  2  O&#8208;induced defects. This work shows the potential of  in situ  PiFM to unravel gas sorption mechanisms and map active sites on functional (MOF) materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Micrometer&#8208;sized DNA Tracks for High&#8208;Speed DNA Synthesis and Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>&#981;29 DNA polymerase (Pol&#981;29) is capable of synthesizing long&#8208;chain single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA molecules by copying the sequence of a small ss circular DNA template (ssCDT) in a process known as rolling circle amplification (RCA). The use of a ssCDT in RCA, however, comes with a key drawback: the rate of DNA synthesis is significantly reduced. We hypothesize that this issue can be overcome using a very long linear ssDNA template with a repeating sequence. To test this idea, we have engineered a special DNA assembly which we denote &#8220;micrometer&#8208;sized DNA track&#8221; or simply &#181;DT. This &#181;DT, with an average length of ~13.5 &#181;m, is made of a long chain DNA with a primer&#8208;binding domain at its 3&#8242; end and ~1000 repeating sequence units at its 5&#8242; end each carrying a DNA anchor. We find that Pol&#981;29 copies &#181;DT at a speed ~5&#8208;time faster than it does a related ssCDT. We take advantage of this finding by designing a simple all&#8208;in&#8208;one printed paper device for rapid and sensitive detection of microRNA let&#8208;7. This paper sensor is capable of detecting 1 pM let&#8208;7a in just 10 minutes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the Surface Oxidation of Cu Nanowires Improves Their Catalytic Selectivity and Stability toward C2+ Products in CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Copper nanostructures are promising catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 because of their unique ability to produce a large proportion of multi&#8208;carbon products. Despite major progress, the selectivity and stability of such catalysts still need to be substantially improved. Here we demonstrate that controlling the surface oxidation of Cu nanowires (CuNWs) can greatly improve their C2+ selectivity and stability. Specifically, we achieve a faradaic efficiency as high as 57.7 and 52.0% for ethylene when the CuNWs are oxidized by the O2 from air and aqueous H2O2, respectively, and both of them show hydrogen selectivity below 12%. The high yields of C2+ products can be mainly attributed to the increase in surface roughness and the generation of defects and cavities during the electrochemical reduction of oxide layer. Our results also indicate that the formation of a relatively thick, smooth oxide sheath can improve the catalytic stability by mitigating the fragmentation issue.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Oxidative One&#8208;Carbon Difunctionalization Towards Multi&#8208;Substituted Imino Sulfide Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>Ethers (C&#8208;O/S) are ubiquitously found in a wide array of functional molecules and natural products. Nonetheless, the synthesis of imino sulfide ethers, containing N(sp  2  )=C(sp  2  )&#8211;O/S fragment, still remains a great challenge due to its sensitivity to acid. Herein, we developed an unprecedented electrochemical oxidative one&#8208;carbon difunctionalization of isocyanides, providing a series of novel multi&#8208;substituted imino sulfide ethers. Under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions, isocyanides could react smoothly with simple and readily available mercaptans and alcohols. Importantly, the procedure exhibited high stereoselectivities, excellent functional group tolerance, good efficiency in large&#8208;scale synthesis as well as further derivatization of products.</dc:description>

      <title>Activity and Stability Boosting of Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich BiVO4 Photoanode by NiFe&#8208;MOFs Thin Layer for Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>The introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ov) has been regarded as an effective method to enhance the catalytic performance of photoanodes in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their stability under highly oxidizing environment is questionable but was rarely studied. Herein, NiFe&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (NiFe&#8208;MOFs) was conformally coated on oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiVO  4  (Ov&#8208;BiVO  4  ) as the protective layer and cocatalyst, forming a  core&#8208;shell  structure with caffeic acid as bridging agent. The as&#8208;synthesized Ov&#8208;BiVO  4  @NiFe&#8208;MOFs exhibits enhanced stability and a remarkable photocurrent density of 5.3&#177;0.15 mA cm  &#8722;2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The reduced coordination number of Ni(Fe)&#8208;O and elevated valence state of Ni(Fe) in NiFe&#8208;MOFs layer greatly bolster OER, and the shifting of oxygen evolution sites from Ov&#8208;BiVO  4  to NiFe&#8208;MOFs promotes Ov stabilization. The results demonstrate that the Ovs can be effectively preserved by the coating of a thin NiFe&#8208;MOFs layer, leading to a photoanode of enhanced photocurrent and stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Signaling in Systems Chemistry: Programing Gold Nanoparticles Formation and Assembly Using a Dynamic Bistable Network</title>
      <dc:description>Living cells exploit bistable and oscillatory behaviors as memory mechanisms, facilitating the integration of transient stimuli into sustained molecular responses that control downstream functions. Synthetic bistable networks have also been studied as memory entities, but have rarely been utilized to control orthogonal functions in coupled dynamic systems. We herein present a new cascade pathway, for which we have exploited a well&#8208;characterized switchable peptide&#8208;based replicating network, operating far from equilibrium, that yields two alternative steady state outputs, which in turn serve as the input signals for consecutive processes that regulate various features of Au nanoparticle shape and assembly.

      <title>Solvation Effects on the Structure and Stability of Alkali Metal Carbenoids</title>
      <dc:description>s&#8208;Block metal carbenoids are carbene synthons and applied in a myriad of organic transformations. They exhibit a strong structure&#8208;activity relation&#173;ship, but this is only poorly understood due to the challenging high reactivity and sensitivity of these reagents. Here, we report on systematic VT and DOSY NMR studies, XRD analyses as well as DFT calculations on a sulfoximinoyl&#8208;substituted model system to explain the pronounced solvent dependency of the carbenoid stability. While the sodium and potassium chloride car&#173;benoids showed high stabilities independent of the solvent, the lithium carbenoid was stable at room temperature in THF but decomposed at &#8722;10 &#176;C in toluene. These divergent stabilities could be explained by the different structures formed in solution. In contrast to simple organolithium reagents, the monomeric THF&#8208;solvate was found to be more stable than the dimer in toluene, since the latter more readily forms direct Li/Cl interactions which facilitate decomposition via &#945;&#8208;elimination.</dc:description>

Although the MM&#8217;Au  21  superatomic molecules correspond to O  2  in terms of the number of valence electrons (12 e), the distances between the icosahedrons were larger than that in the bi&#8208;icosahedral Au  23  core of Au  38  (PET)  24  corresponding to F  2  and the spin state was singlet.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Targeted syntheses of MM&#8217;Au  36  (PET)  24  (M, M&#8217; = Pd, Pt; PET = SC  2  H  4  Ph) were achieved by hydride&#8208;mediated fusion reactions between [MAu  8  (PPh  3  )  8  ]  2+  and [M&#8217;Au  24  (PET)  18  ]  &#8211;  . Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the products have biicosahedral MM&#8217;Au  21  cores composed of M@Au  12  and M&#8217;@Au  12  superatoms. Although the MM&#8217;Au  21  superatomic molecules correspond to O  2  in terms of the number of valence electrons (12 e), the distances between the icosahedrons were larger than that in the bi&#8208;icosahedral Au  23  core of Au  38  (PET)  24  corresponding to F  2  and the spin state was singlet. These counterintuitive results were explained by a &#8220;bent bonding model&#8221; based on tilted (non&#8208;orthogonal) bonding interaction between the 1P superatomic orbitals of M@Au  12  and M&#8217;@Au  12  superatoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Controlling Intramolecular F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer and Singlet Fission in a Subporphyrazine&#8208;Pentacene Conjugate by Solvent Polarity</title>
      <dc:description>Due its complementary absorptions in the range of 450 and 600 nm, an energy&#8208;donating hexaaryl&#8208;subporphyrazine has been linked to a pentacene dimer, which acts primarily as energy acceptor and secondarily as a singlet fission enabler. In the corresponding conjugate, efficient intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (i&#8208;FRET) is the modus operandi to transfer energy from the subporphyrazine to the pentacene dimer. Upon energy transfer, the pentacene dimer undergoes intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF), that is, converting the singlet excited state, via an intermediate state, into a pair of correlated triplet excited states. Solvatochromic fluorescence of the subporphyrazine is a key feature of this system and features a red&#8208;shift as large as 20 nm in polar media. Solvent is thus used to modulate spectral overlap between the fluorescence of subporphyrazine and absorption of the pentacene dimer, which controls the F&#246;rster rate constant, on one hand, and the triplet quantum yield, on the other hand. The optimum spectral overlap is realized in xylene, leading to F&#246;rster rate constant of 3.52 &#215; 10  11  s  &#8211;1  and a triplet quantum yield of 171% &#177; 10%. In short, the solvent polarity dependence, which is a unique feature of subporphyrazines, is decisive in terms of adjusting spectral overlap, ensuring a sizable F&#246;rster rate constant, and maximizing triplet quantum yields. Uniquely, this optimization can be achieved without a need for synthetic modification of the subporphyrazine donor.</dc:description>

      <title>Introducing tox&#8208;Profiles of Chemical Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
In this Essay we propose tox&#8208;Profiles of chemical reactions to eliminate misleading preconceptions about the biological activity of organic molecules and to stimulate further progress in the field. tox&#8208;Profiles can be used to classify synthetic reactions, mange the biological activity of molecules, and guide the rational development of new methodologies.







Abstract
In this Essay, we present a critical analysis of two common practices in modern chemistry&#8212;that is, of using speculations about the &#8220;greenness&#8221; and &#8220;nontoxicity&#8221; of developed synthesis procedures and of a priori labelling various compounds derived from natural sources as being environmentally safe. We note that every organic molecule that contains functional groups should be biologically active. Thus, analysis of the particular greenness and the potential environmental impact of a given chemical process should account for the biological activity of all its components in a measureable (rather than empirical) way. We highlight the necessity of clarifying discussions on biological activity and toxicity and propose possible ways of introducing tox&#8208;Profiles as a reliable overview of the overall toxicity of chemical reactions.

      <title>Engineering Atomically Dispersed FeN4 Active Sites for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>Atomically dispersed FeN  4  active sites have exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. However, the understanding behind the intrinsic and morphological factors contributing to the catalytic properties of FeN  4  sites is still lacking. Using a Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C model catalyst derived from the ZIF&#8208;8, we deconvoluted three key morphological and structural elements of FeN  4  sites, including particle sizes of catalysts, Fe content, and Fe&#8208;N bond structures. Their monotonous effects on the CO2RR were comprehensively elucidated. Engineering the particle size and Fe doping is critical to control extrinsic morphological factors of FeN  4  sites for optimal porosity, electrochemically active surface areas, and the graphitization of the carbon support. In contrast, the intrinsic activity of FeN  4  sites was only tunable by varying thermal activation temperatures during the formation of FeN  4  sites, which impacted the length of the Fe&#8208;N bonds and the local strains. The structural evolution of Fe&#8208;N bonds was characterized at the atomic level. First&#8208;principles calculations further elucidated the origin of intrinsic activity improvement associated with the optimal local strain on the Fe&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

      <title>London dispersion in alkane solvents</title>
      <dc:description>The importance of London dispersion interactions in solution is an ongoing debate. Although the significance of dispersion for structure and stability is widely accepted, the degree of its attenuation in solution is still not properly understood. Quantitative evaluations are derived mostly from computations. Experimental data provide guidelines to include London dispersion in solution phase design. Herein, dispersive interactions were examined with an azobenzene probe. Alkyl substituents in  meta  positions of the azobenzene core were systematically varied and the effect on the half&#8208;lives for the thermally induced  Z  to  E  isomerization in several alkane solvents was determined. The results show that intramolecular dispersion is only marginally influenced. In solvents with low surface tension, reduced destabilizing solvent&#8208;solvent interactions increase the half&#8208;life up to 20%. Specific individual interactions between alkyl chains on the azobenzene and those of the solvent lead to additional fluctuations of the half&#8208;lives. These presumably result from structural changes of the conformer ensemble.</dc:description>

      <title>Dye&#8208;Doped Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced ECL&#8208;Based Immunoassay Analytical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Using silica nanoparticles, a 8.5&#8208;fold higher ECL intensity was achieved with respect to a system mimicking a commercial immuno&#8208;sensing system, benefiting from the deep knowledge acquired by combining ECL with nanostructures.







Abstract
The combination of highly sensitive techniques such as electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with nanotechnology sparked new analytical applications, in particular for immunoassay&#8208;based detection systems. In this context, nanomaterials, particularly dye&#8208;doped silica nanoparticles (DDSNPs) are of high interest, since they can offer several advantages in terms of sensitivity and performance. In this work we synthesized two sets of monodispersed and biotinylated [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;doped silica nanoparticles, named bio&#8208;Triton@RuNP and bio&#8208;Igepal@RuNP, obtained following the reverse microemulsion method using two different types of nonionic surfactants. Controlling the synthetic procedures, we were able to obtain nanoparticles (NPs) offering highly intense signal, using tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as coreactant, with bio&#8208;Triton@RuNps being more efficient than bio&#8208;Igepal@RuNP.

      <title>Interlayer Engineering of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 Modulates Selective Hydronium Intercalation in Neutral Aqueous Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>Among various charge carrier ions for aqueous batteries, non&#8208;metal hydronium (H3O+) with small ionic size and fast diffusion kinetics empowers H3O+&#8208;intercalation electrodes with high rate performance and fast&#8208;charging capability. However, pure H3O+  charge carriers for inorganic electrode materials have only been observed in corrosive acidic electrolytes, rather than in mild neutral electrolytes. Here, we report how selective H3O+  intercalation in a neutral ZnCl2  electrolyte can be achieved for water&#8208;proton co&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3  (denoted WP&#8208;MoO3  ). H2O molecules located between MoO3  interlayers are disclosed to block Zn2+  intercalation pathways while allowing smooth H3O+  intercalation/diffusion through a Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. Compared to &#945;&#8208;MoO3  with Zn2+&#8208;intercalation mechanism, WP&#8208;MoO3  delivers the substantially enhanced specific capacity (356.8  vs.  184.0 mA h g&#8722;1), rate capability (77.5%  vs.  42.2% from 0.4 to 4.8 A g&#8722;1), and cycling stability (83%  vs.  13% over 1000 cycles). This work demonstrates the possibility of modulating electrochemical intercalating ions by interlayer engineering, which indicates a promising direction to construct high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life electrodes for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Real&#8208;time Monitoring Reveals Dissolution/Redeposition Mechanism in Cu Nanocatalysts during the Initial Stages of the CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Size, morphology and surface sites of electrocatalysts have a major impact on their performance. Understanding how, when, and why these parameters change under operating conditions is of uttermost importance for designing stable, active, and selective catalysts. Here, we study the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based nanocatalysts during the startup phase of the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction by combining results from electrochemical in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We reveal that dissolution followed by redeposition, rather than coalescence, is the mechanism responsible for the size increase and morphology change of the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, we point out the key role played by the formation of copper oxides in the process. Understanding of the underlying processes opens a pathway to rational design of Cu electro (re)deposited catalysts and to stability improvement for catalysts fabricated by other methods.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Arranging ionic liquids (ILs) with long&#8208;range order can not only enhance their performances in a desired application, but can also help elucidate the vital relationship between structure and properties. However, achieving long&#8208;range ordered ILs is still a formidable challenge and no successful example has been reported to date. In this work, we report a feasible strategy to achieve a crystalline IL via coordination self&#8208;assembly based reticular chemistry. The first crystalline IL bearing a long&#8208;range ordered framework,  IL  1  MOF  , was prepared by designing an IL bridging ligand and then connecting them with metal clusters.  IL  1  MOF  possesses a very unique structure, where the IL ligands are arranged on a long&#8208;range ordered framework but have a labile ionic center. This structure enables  IL  1  MOF  to break through the typical limitation where the solid ILs have lower proton conductivity than their counterpart bulk ILs.  IL  1  MOF  shows 2&#8208;4 orders of magnitude higher proton conductivity than its counterpart IL monomer across a wide temperature range. Its conductivity is also an order magnitude higher than the highest reported values for solid protic IL derivatives and MOF&#8208;based anhydrous proton conductors at room temperature. Moreover, by confining the IL within ultramicropores (&lt; 1 nm),  IL  1  MOF  suppresses the liquid&#8208;solid phase transition temperatures to lower than &#8208;150  o  C, allowing it to function with high conductivity in a subzero temperature range. This work is expected to open a toolbox for designing new&#8208;generation IL materials for important applications.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Strategy to Control Viscosity Sensitivity of Molecular Rotor&#8208;Based Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular rotor&#8208;based fluorophores (RBFs) have been widely used in many fields. However, it remained enigmatic how to rationally control their viscosity sensitivity, thus limiting their application. Herein, we resolve this problem by chemically installing extended &#960;&#8208;rich alternating carbon&#8208;carbon linkage between the rotational electron donor and acceptor of RBFs. Our data reveal that the length of &#960;&#8208;rich linkage strongly influences the viscosity sensitivity, likely resulted from varying height of the energy barriers between the fluorescent planar and the dark twisted configurations. This mechanism allows for the design of three scaffolds of RBF derivatives that span a wide range of viscosity sensitivities. Application of these RBFs is demonstrated by a dual&#8208;color imaging strategy that can differentiate misfolded protein oligomers and insoluble aggregates both in test tubes and live cells. Beyond RBFs, we envision that this chemical mechanism might be generally applicable to a wide range of photoisomerizable and aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorophores.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A metal/ligand cooperative approach to reduction of small molecules by metal silylene complexes (R2Si=M) is demonstrated, whereby silicon activates the incoming substrate and mediates net two&#8208;electron transformations via one&#8208;electron redox processes at two metal centers.

Experimental and computational studies suggest a plausible mechanism proceeding via [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition to the silylene complex that is quite sensitive to steric environment. The Co(II)/Co(II) products are further reactive to oxidation and reduction.

A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is important for the construction of molecular and electronic devices. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006318), Y. Tian et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond is highly stable under thiol&#8208;abundant conditions and shows better electrochemical performance compared to Au&#8722;S and Au&#8722;Se bonds. Based on the remarkable performance of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, a Fe2+ electrochemical sensor was developed and applied in the biosensing and analyzing of Fe2+ in live brain.

     alt="A Robust Au&#8722;C&#8801;C Surface: Toward Real&#8208;time Mapping and Accurate Quantification of Fe2+ in the Live Brain of AD Model"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is important for the construction of molecular and electronic devices. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200631810.1002/anie.202006318&lt;/a&gt;), Y. Tian et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond is highly stable under thiol&#8208;abundant conditions and shows better electrochemical performance compared to Au&#8722;S and Au&#8722;Se bonds. Based on the remarkable performance of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, a Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; electrochemical sensor was developed and applied in the biosensing and analyzing of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in live brain.

      <title>Overcoming Fundamental Limitations in Adsorbent Design: Alkene Adsorption by Non&#8208;porous Copper(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
The iceberg theme represents how H.&#8197;V.&#8197;R. Dias, M.&#8197;G. Cowan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010405) utilize solution&#8208;chemistry in a solid&#8208;state reaction for the separation of alkenes and alkanes, leading to potentially major effects on reducing global energy use and global warming. In&#8208;situ PXRD was used to watch the reversible trimer to dimer rearrangement in the solid&#8208;state, where multiple bonds are broken and reformed.&#160;The rapid uptake and release, the minimal heat of adsorption of alkene, and the reusability of these materials make the process a sustainable alternative for distillation methods.
