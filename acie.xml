      <title>Hierarchy Control of MFI Zeolite Membrane towards Superior Butane Isomer Separation Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Microstructural optimization (e.g., thickness and preferred orientation) represents a major concern for performance enhancement of zeolite membranes. In this study, we demonstrated that the introduction of hierarchy easily enabled concurrent thickness reduction and orientation control of zeolite membranes. Specifically, hierarchical MFI zeolite membranes comprising higher degree of (  h  0  h  ) preferentially oriented ultrathin (ca. 380 nm) selective top layers and porous intermediate layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  substrates were fabricated. The use of hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and the employment of single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing were found indispensable for the preparation of MFI zeolite membranes with superior butane isomer separation performance, thereby surpassing the current  n  &#8208;/  i  &#8208;butane selectivity versus  n  &#8208;butane permeance trade&#8208;off limits of MFI zeolite membranes prepared via solution&#8208;based synthetic protocols.</dc:description>

      <title>Fungal Dioxygenase AsqJ Is Promiscuous and Bimodal: Substrate&#8208;Directed Formation of Quinolones versus&#160;Quinazolinones</title>
      <dc:description>Previous studies showed that the Fe  II  /&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase AsqJ induces a skeletal rearrangement in viridicatin biosynthesis in  Aspergillus nidulans  , generating a quinolone scaffold from benzo[1.4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates. We report that AsqJ catalyzes an additional, entirely different reaction, simply by a change in substituent in the benzodiazepinedione substrate. This new mechanism is established by substrate screening, application of functional probes, and computational analysis. AsqJ excises H  2  CO from the heterocyclic ring structure of suitable benzo[1.4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates to generate quinazolinones. This novel AsqJ catalysis pathway is governed by a single substituent within the complex substrate. This unique substrate&#8208;directed reactivity of AsqJ enables the targeted biocatalytic generation of either quinolones or quinazolinones, two alkaloid frameworks of exceptional biomedical relevance.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Addition of &#945;&#8208;Nitroesters to Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
An enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to alkynes affords access to &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors containing contiguous stereocenters. These motifs can be further transformed into &#945;&#8208;amino esters without stereoablation.







Abstract
By using Rh&#8211;H catalysis, we couple &#945;&#8208;nitroesters and alkynes to prepare &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors. This atom&#8208;economical strategy generates two contiguous stereocenters, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. In this transformation, the alkyne undergoes isomerization to generate a RhIII&#8211;&#960;&#8208;allyl electrophile, which is trapped by an &#945;&#8208;nitroester nucleophile. A subsequent reduction with In powder transforms the allylic &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to the corresponding &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters.

      <title>Strategies and Perspectives to Catch the Missing Pieces in Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8211;OH) and their heterostructures (X | M&#8211;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme Instructed Self&#8208;assembly Enabled Monomer&#8208;excimer Transition to Construct Higher Ordered Luminescent Supramolecular Assembly for Activity&#8208;based Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>How to construct high&#8208;performing excimer&#8208;based luminescent analytic tools at low molecular concentrations remains a challenge. Here, we reported that enzyme instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) enabled the monomer&#8208;excimer transition of a coumarin dye (  Cou  ) at low molecular concentrations, and the resulting higher ordered luminescent supramolecular assemblies (i.e., nanofibers) efficiently recorded the spatiotemporal details of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity  in vitro  and  in vivo  .  Cou  was conjugated to short self&#8208;assembly peptides with a hydrophilic ALP&#8208;responsive group.  By ALP triggering, EISA actuated nanoparticles&#8208;nanofibers transition at low peptides concentrations  followed by monomer&#8208;excimer transition of  Cou  .  Analysis of structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that the self&#8208;assembly motif was a prerequisite for peptides to induce monomer&#8208;excimer transition of  Cou  .  Luminescent supramolecular nanofibers of  pYD  (  LSN&#8208;  pYD  ) illuminated the intercellular bridge of cancer cells and distinguished cancer cells (tissues) from normal cells (tissues) efficiently and rapidly, promising the potential use for early diagnosis of cancer.

      <title>Platinum Dissolution in Realistic Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights were gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8208;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes are evaluated directly. We observe that (i) specific Pt dissolution is increasing significantly with decreasing Pt loading, (ii) in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments is considerably lower and, (iii) by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution is reduced even further. All these phenomena are attributed to the varying mass transport conditions of dissolved Pt species, influencing re&#8208;deposition and equilibrium potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemiluminescence loss in photobleaching</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of photobleaching on electrochemi&#173;luminescence (ECL) was investigated for the first time. The plasma membrane of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was labeled with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative. Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) or Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) methods.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to  s  &#8208;block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of  s  Bu  2  Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R = 2&#8208;ethylhexyl), where unusually both  s  Bu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2&#8208;FG&#8208;C  6  H  4  )  2  (OR)}  2  ] (FG= OMe; NMe  2  ) or a homoaryl [(THF)  4  Li  2  Mg(4&#8208;FG&#8208;C  6  H  4  )  4  ] (FG= OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk&#8208;type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMg  s  Bu  2  (OR)], alkyl rich [Li  2  Mg  s  Bu  4  ] and Mg(OR)  2  , with [Li  2  Mg  s  Bu  4  ] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures have drawn enormous attention recently due to their multifunctionality. However, the regulations of the size and morphology of yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures are still limited by the unclear formation mechanism. Herein, we first demonstrated a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing yolk&#8208;shelled MOFs&#8208;based nanostructures coated with mesoporous SiO2  shells (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2  ) with tunable size and morphology. The selective and competitive adsorption of methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) on ZIF&#8208;8 core were found to have decisive effects on inducing the morphology evolution of yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures. The obtained yolk&#8208;shelled ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2  nanostructures show great promise in generating acoustic cavitation effect for sonodynamic cancer therapy  in vitro  .

      <title>A Universal Approach for Controllable Synthesis of n&#8208;Specific Layer 2D Perovskite Nanoplates</title>
      <dc:description>2D perovskites with chemical formula A&#8242;  2  A  n&#8722;1  B  n  X  3n+1  have recently attracted considerable attention due to their tunable optical and electronic properties by varying the chemical composition. While high color&#8208;purity emitting perovskite nanomaterials have been accomplished through changing the halide composition, the preparation of single&#8208;phase, specific n&#8208;layer 2D perovskite nanomaterials is still pending because of the fast nucleation process of nanoparticles. In this study, we demonstrated a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesize monodisperse 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite through kinetic control. We found that casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium would promote selective formation of the kinetic product, multi&#8208;layer 2D perovskite, in preference to the single layer thermodynamic one. The resulted n&#8208;specific layer 2D perovskites show a trend where decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.</dc:description>

While high color&#8208;purity emitting perovskite nanomaterials have been accomplished through changing the halide composition, the preparation of single&#8208;phase, specific n&#8208;layer 2D perovskite nanomaterials is still pending because of the fast nucleation process of nanoparticles. In this study, we demonstrated a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesize monodisperse 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite through kinetic control. We found that casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium would promote selective formation of the kinetic product, multi&#8208;layer 2D perovskite, in preference to the single layer thermodynamic one. The resulted n&#8208;specific layer 2D perovskites show a trend where decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A General Approach for Monolayer Adsorption of High Weight Loadings of Uniform Nanocrystals on Oxide Supports</title>
      <dc:description>Monodispersed metal and semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research due to their tunable size, morphology, and well&#8208;defined chemical composition. Utilizing these nanocrystals in a controllable way is highly desirable especially when using them as building blocks for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Their deposition onto oxide materials provide them with wide applicability in many areas, including catalysis. However, so far deposition methods are limited and do not provide control to achieve high particle loadings. This study demonstrates a general approach for the deposition of hydrophobic ligand&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on hydrophilic oxide supports without ligand&#8208;exchange. Surface functionalization of the supports with primary amine groups either using an organosilane ((3&#8208;aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane) or bonding with aminoalcohols (3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol) were found to significantly improve the interaction between nanocrystals and supports achieving high loadings (&gt;10 wt. %). The bonding method with aminoalcohols guarantees the opportunity to remove the binding molecules thus allowing clean metal/oxide materials to be obtained, which is of great importance in the preparation of supported nanocrystals for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>With the aid of an electron donor&#8722;acceptor (EDA) complex, we have successfully achieved the strain&#8208;release aminopyridiylation of [1.1.1]propellane employing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents, which allows the direct installation of amino and pyridyl groups onto bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) frameworks in the absence of an external photocatalyst.

      <title>A MOF&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;Strong Acetylene Nano&#8208;trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Porous materials with open metal sites have been extensively investigated to separate various gas mixtures in the last decades. However, compared with the multiple binding sites, the current open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C  2  H  2  /CO  2  , which have very similar physical properties. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C  2  H  2  nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C  2  H  2  molecules and separate C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark  Q  st  of 79.1 kJ mol  &#8208;1  for C  2  H  2  , a record high pure C  2  H  2  uptake of 2.54 mmol g  &#8208;1  at 1&#215;10  &#8208;2  bar, and the highest C  2  H  2  /CO  2  selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C  2  H  2  and the separation of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  . The locations of C  2  H  2  molecules within the MOF&#8208;based nanotrap have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C  2  H  2  .

      <title>Efficient n&#8208;Doping of Polymeric Semiconductors through Controlling the Dynamics of Solution&#8208;State Polymer Aggregates</title>
      <dc:description>Doping of polymeric semiconductors is often limited by the miscibility issue between polymers and dopants.  Although significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the miscibility via chemical modification, the electrical conductivities of n&#8208;doped polymeric semiconductors are usually below 10 S cm  &#8722;1  . Here, we report a different approach to overcome the miscibility issue by modulating the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers. We found that the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers not only change with solvent and temperature but also change with solution aging time. Modulating the solution&#8208;state polymer aggregates can directly influence their solid&#8208;state microstructures and miscibility with dopants. As a result, both high doping efficiency and high charge carrier mobility were simultaneously obtained.  The n&#8208;doped electrical conductivity of P(PzDPP&#8208;CT2)  can be tuned up to 32.1 S cm  &#8722;1  after exploring the dynamics of the polymer aggregates. This method can also be used to improve the doping efficiency of other polymer systems (e.g. N2200) with different aggregation tendencies and behaviors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the polymer aggregates and the influence on the solid&#8208;state microstructures and doping efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of photoelectrochemical DNA biosensing using plasmonic DNA barcodes and differential signal readout</title>
      <dc:description>PEC biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices. We developed a new PEC biosensing strategy that uses differential signal generation, combining signals from two separate but correlated binding events on the biosensor, for improving the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection, sensitivity, and specificity of PEC DNA biosensors in biological samples. In this assay, the binding of unlabeled target DNA is followed by the capture of a signal amplification barcode featuring a plasmonic nanoparticle. The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15 and three times, respectively, compared to the previously&#8208;used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 3 fM.</dc:description>

The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15 and three times, respectively, compared to the previously&#8208;used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 3 fM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ru&#8208;catalyzed Dehydrogenation Through an Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes is among the most efficient ways to access valuable alkene products. Although several catalysts have been designed to promote this transformation, they have unfortunately found limited applications in fine chemical synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel strategy for the catalytic, intermolecular dehydrogenation of alkanes using a ruthenium catalyst. The combination of a redox&#8208;active ligand and a sterically hindered aryl radical intermediate has unleashed this novel strategy. Importantly, mechanistic investigations have been performed to provide a conceptual framework for the further development of this new catalytic dehydrogenation system.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Redox Mechanism of Low&#8208;Temperature NH3&#8208;SCR over Cu&#8208;CHA:&#160;A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Reduction Half Cycle</title>
      <dc:description>Cu&#8208;CHA is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of e.g., nature of active Cu&#8208;ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Here we address the redox mechanism underlying low&#8208;temperature (LT) SCR on Cu&#8208;CHA via an unprecedented integration of chemical&#8208;trapping techniques, transient&#8208;response methods, operando UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the reduction half&#8208;cycle (RHC) of LT&#8208;SCR display a quadratic dependence on Cu  II  , thus questioning single&#8208;site mechanisms based on isolated Cu  II  &#8208;ions. We propose, instead, a Cu  II  &#8208;pair mediated LT&#8208;RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite&#8208;precursor intermediates accounts for Cu  II  reduction. These results highlight for the first time the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT&#8208;SCR, but also in the RHC cascade.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysis in MoS2 monolayer activated by long&#8208;range ferromagnetism: beyond the single&#8208;atom catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysts with fully activated basal&#8208;atoms will provide an ultimate solution to the low loading&#8208;density bottleneck of single&#8208;atom catalysts. Herein, we propose a strategy to activate the majority of basal sites of monolayer MoS  2  , by doping Co ions to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. This strategy, as revealed by  in&#8208;situ  synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50% of the originally inert basal&#8208;plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction.  Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS  2  measured by on&#8208;chip micro&#8208;cell, a &#160;current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  could be achieved at the overpotential of 137 mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571 A g  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. The exchange current density of 75 &#956;A cm  &#8208;2  for the monolayer also surpasses most of other MoS  2  &#8208;based catalysts reported so far. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that the activation of basal plane S atoms is due to the delocalization of spin states of  d  &#8208;electron and the increase of S&#8208;  p  electronic density around the Fermi level, and hence promotes the H adsorption ability of basal&#8208;plane S atoms.</dc:description>

This strategy, as revealed by  in&#8208;situ  synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50% of the originally inert basal&#8208;plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction.  Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS  2  measured by on&#8208;chip micro&#8208;cell, a &#160;current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  could be achieved at the overpotential of 137 mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571 A g  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. The exchange current density of 75 &#956;A cm  &#8208;2  for the monolayer also surpasses most of other MoS  2  &#8208;based catalysts reported so far. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that the activation of basal plane S atoms is due to the delocalization of spin states of  d  &#8208;electron and the increase of S&#8208;  p  electronic density around the Fermi level, and hence promotes the H adsorption ability of basal&#8208;plane S atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Amine&#8208;to&#8208;azide conversion on native RNA via metal&#8208;free diazo transfer opens new avenues&#160;for RNA manipulations</title>
      <dc:description>A major challenge in the field of RNA chemistry is the identification of selective and quantitative conversion reactions on RNA that can be used for tagging and any other RNA tool development. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA containing an aliphatic primary amino group using the diazotizing reagent fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO  2  N  3  ). The reaction provides the corresponding azide&#8208;modified RNA in nearly quantitatively yields without affecting the nucleobase amino groups. The obtained azido&#8208;RNA can then be further processed utilizing well&#8208;established bioorthogonal reactions such as azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (Click) or Staudinger ligations. We exemplify the robustness of this approach for the synthesis of peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics and for the pull&#8208;down of acp  3  U and k  2  C containing tRNAs of the&#160;  E.coli  tRNA pool isolated from cellular extracts.

      <title>Phenotypic Discovery of Neuroprotective Agents by Regulation of Tau Proteostasis via Stress&#8208;Responsive Activation of PERK Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as tau protein. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013915), Seung&#8197;Bum Park et&#8197;al. perform a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening and identify a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal assembly of tau protein under the ER stress. The label&#8208;free target identification and mode of action studies revealed that SB1617 treatment leads to the restoration of proteostasis in a stress&#8208;responsive manner.

      <title>Induction of Chirality in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Built from Achiral Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>
Introduction of chirality in a metal&#8211;organic framework built from achiral precursors through achiral template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is demonstrated by Qihui Chen, Maochun Hong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013885).

Xenon separation&#160;from krypton by porous adsorbents is a sustainable technology for the production of small&#8208;volume but high&#8208;value noble gas. MOFs are designer xenon adsorbents to enhance their adsorption separation performance by tuning pore metrics, functionalities, and counter ions.

      <title>Strain Engineering of a MXene/CNT Hierarchical Porous Hollow Microsphere Electrocatalyst for a High&#8208;Efficiency Lithium Polysulfide Conversion Process</title>
      <dc:description>
Strain engineering of Mxene/carbon nanotube microspheres as electrocatalyst for Li&#8208;S batteries is used to realize high&#8208;efficiency LiPS catalytic conversion.







Abstract
Tensile&#8208;strained Mxene/carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres were developed as an electrocatalyst for the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox reaction. The internal stress on the surface results in lattice distortion with expanding Ti&#8722;Ti bonds, endowing the Mxene nanosheet with abundant active sites and regulating the d&#8208;band center of Ti atoms upshifted closer to the Fermi level, leading to strengthened LiPS adsorbability and accelerated catalytic conversion. The macroporous framework offers uniformed sulfur distribution, potent sulfur immobilization, and large surface area. The composite interwoven by CNT tentacle enhances conductivity and prevents the restacking of Mxene sheets. This combination of tensile strain effect and hierarchical architecture design results in smooth and favorable trapping&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion of LiPS on the interface. The Li&#8208;S battery exhibits an initial capacity of 1451&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C, rate capability up to 8&#8197;C, and prolonged cycle life.

      <title>Observation of Carbonic Acid Formation from Interaction between Carbon Dioxide and Ice by Using in situ Modulation Excitation IR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonic acid, H  2  CO  3  , is of fundamental importance in nature both in living and non&#8208;living systems. A lot of research has been devoted to this molecule and it has been characterized in solution, in the solid state and in gas phase, however its existence under certain conditions and its properties remain controversial. Providing direct spectroscopic evidence for carbonic acid formation is a challenge. Furthermore, the methods for carbonic acid generation are indirect e.g. high&#8208;energy irradiation or protonation of carbonate and bicarbonate ions by strong acids. Here we provide clear evidence by  in situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy and phase sensitive detection that CO  2  adsorption on ice surfaces is accompanied by carbonic acid formation. Hence we demonstrate that carbonic acid can be formed from CO  2  on ice in the absence of high&#8208;energy irradiation and without protonation by strong acids. The formation of carbonic acid is favored at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it rapidly dissociates to form bicarbonate (HCO  3  &#8211;  ) and carbonate (CO  3  2&#8208;  ). The direct formation of carbonic acid from adsorption of CO  2  on ice could play a role in the upper troposphere in cirrus clouds, where all the necessary ingredients to form carbonic acid, i.e. low temperature, CO  2  gas and ice, are present.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There&#160;&#160;is intense interest in imaging the intracellular metal ions because of their vital roles in many cellular processes. The challenge has been to develop chemical approaches that can detect metal ions in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Here we report for the first time the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology that can distinguish metal&#8208;ion signal in tumor cells from normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the sensing activity of traditional DNAzyme sensor is inhibited by engineering with a blocking sequence containing an abasic site that can be cleaved by cancer&#8208;specific enzymes and thus enables the selective recovery of metal&#8208;ion sensing capability in cancer cells. We demonstrated that the DNAzyme sensor not only allows for cancer cell&#8208;selective sensing and imaging of metal ions through an enzymically&#8208;activated pathway, but it also can exert precise control over its metal&#8208;ion sensing activity in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. We envision that this biosensing technology provide a much&#8208;needed chemical toolset for exploring the biological roles of diverse metal ions in specific diseases.</dc:description>

      <title>A Robust Triplet Porphyrin&#8208;Stabilized Carbon Diradical</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of robust high&#8208;spin carbon radicals is an important topic in organic chemistry. Toward this end, we have systematically explored several porphyrin&#8208;stabilized radicals. Singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical was synthesized by a reaction sequence consisting of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of  &#946;  &#8208;borylated porphyrin with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde, addition of mesityl Grignard reagent, intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and final oxidation with DDQ or  t  &#8208;BuOK/O  2  .

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of robust high&#8208;spin carbon radicals is an important topic in organic chemistry. Toward this end, we have systematically explored several porphyrin&#8208;stabilized radicals. Singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical was synthesized by a reaction sequence consisting of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of  &#946;  &#8208;borylated porphyrin with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde, addition of mesityl Grignard reagent, intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and final oxidation with DDQ or  t  &#8208;BuOK/O  2  . This strategy has been also used to the synthesis of doubly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrins and  syn  &#8208; and  anti  &#8208;fused&#8208;anthracene&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers. While singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical has been shown to be a stable mono radical, doubly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrins and  anti  &#8208;fused&#8208;anthracene&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been shown to be closed shell molecules.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Protected Metal Halide Perovskite Nanosheets with a Stellar Set of Stabilities</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to synthesize metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with outstanding long&#8208;term stability against a set of external stimuli represents an important step towards their use for a wide spectrum of optoelectronic applications. Notably, approaches to achieve stable PNCs of interest, in particular those with  large structural anisotropy  , via protective coating of inorganic shell at  a single&#8208;nanocrystal (NC) level  are comparatively few and limited in scope. Herein, we report a robust amphiphilic&#8208;diblock&#8208;copolymer&#8208;enabled strategy for crafting highly&#8208;stable  anisotropic  CsPbBr  3  nanosheets (NSs) via  in&#8208;situ  formation of uniform inorganic shell (1  st  shielding) that is intimately ligated with hydrophobic polymers (2  nd  shielding). The dual&#8208;protected NSs display an array of remarkable stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.) and find application in white light&#8208;emitting diodes. In principle, by anchoring other multidentate amphiphilic polymer ligands on the surface of PNCs, followed by templated&#8208;growth of shell materials of interest, a rich variety of dual&#8208;shelled, multifunctional PNCs with markedly improved stabilities can be created for use in optics, optoelectronics and sensory devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Inversely Tuning the CO2 Electroreduction and Hydrogen Evolution Activity on Metal Oxide via Heteroatom Doping</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning the electronic states near the Fermi level can effectively facilitate the reaction kinetics. However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO  2  RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO  2  RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO  2  RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient CO  2  RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Tracing Tumor&#8208;derived Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 by Dual&#8208;aptamer Activated Proximity&#8208;induced Droplet Digital PCR</title>
      <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;derived exosomal proteins have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, but the quantitation accuracy is severely hindered by large numbers of normal cell&#8208; derived exosomes. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;target&#8208;specific aptamer recognition activated in&#8208;situ connection system on exosome membrane combined with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (TRACER) for precise quantitative analysis of tumor&#8208;derived exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1). Taking advantage of the high binding affinity of aptamers, excellent selectivity of dual&#8208;aptamer recognition and the high sensitivity of ddPCR, this method exhibits significant sensitivity and selectivity for tracing tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1  in a wash&#8208;free manner. Due to the excellent sensitivity, the level of tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1  detected by TRACER can effectively distinguish cancer patients from healthy donors, and for the first time was identified as a more reliable tumor diagnostic marker than total Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1. Overall, TRACER strategy holds great potential for analysis of different subtypes of exosomes, unprecedented capability for converting exosomes into reliable clinical indicators and exploring the biological functions of exosomes.</dc:description>

      <title>Stabilization of Undercooled State via Passivating Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Advances in hybrid, high&#8208;density and flexible/wearable electronics demand low temperature metal processing. Undercooled metals have emerged as a solution to low temperature soldering and printing of conductive traces. The process of undercooling, however, relies on frustration of liquid&#8208;solid transition mainly through increase in activation energy by: i) elimination heterogeneous nucleants, or ii) frustrating homogeneous nucleation. We inferred that passivating oxide layers present an active platform that can isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7&#8208;5 nm) oxide shell hence slows homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. Herein, the role of surface oxide structure in enhancing and maintaining undercooling is demonstrated. We demonstrate that; i) the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat&#8208;free solders, ii) that inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and iii) that magnitude of the effect of the passivating oxide can be larger that of size in undercooling.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in hybrid, high&#8208;density and flexible/wearable electronics demand low temperature metal processing.

      <title>Anion texturing towards dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode for aqueous rechargeable battery</title>
      <dc:description>The reversibility of metal anode is a fundamental challenge to the lifetime of rechargeable batteries. Though being widely employed in aqueous energy storage systems, metallic zinc suffers from dendrite formation that severely hinders its applications. Here we report texturing Zn as an effective way to address the issue of zinc dendrite. An in&#8208;plane oriented Zn texture with preferentially exposed (002) basal plane is demonstrated via a sulfonate anion&#8208;induced electrodeposition, noting no solid report on (002) textured Zn till now. Anion&#8208;induced reconstruction of zinc coordination is revealed to be responsible for the texture formation. Benchmarking against its (101) textured&#8208;counterpart by the conventional sulphate&#8208;based electrolyte, the Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible stripping/plating at a high current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , showing its dendrite&#8208;free characteristics. The Zn (002) texture&#8208;based aqueous zinc battery exhibits excellent cycling stability. The developed anion texturing approach provides a pathway towards exploring zinc chemistry and prospering aqueous rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Oxalohydrazide Ligands for Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O Coupling Reactions with High Turnover Numbers</title>
      <dc:description>The development of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;based ligands for copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions lags behind that of phosphines for analogous palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. In particular, ligands that generate copper catalysts reacting with lifetimes resembling those of palladium catalysts have been lacking. Here, we report a class of ligands based on oxalohydrazide cores and  N  &#8208;amino pyrrole and  N  &#8208;amino indole units that generates long&#8208;lived copper catalysts for couplings that form the C&#8211;O bonds in biaryl ethers. Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling of phenols with aryl bromides occurred with 8000 turnovers, a value which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of prior couplings to form biaryl ethers and nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of any prior copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides. This ligand also led to copper systems that catalyze the coupling of aryl chlorides with phenols and the coupling of aryl bromides and iodides with primary benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. A wide variety of functional groups including nitriles, halides, ethers, ketones, amines, esters, amides, vinylarenes, alcohols and boronic acid esters were tolerated, and reactions occurred with aryl bromides in pharmaceutically related structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystal Flexibility Design through Local and Global Motility Cooperation</title>
      <dc:description>Incorporating local mobility into a flexible framework promises to create cooperative properties unattainable in a conventional soft porous crystal. In this study, we propose a design strategy that integrates substituent moieties and a flexible porous crystal framework via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. This integration not only facilitates framework structural transitions but also gives the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) different guest&#8208;free structures that depend on the activation conditions. The incorporated flexibility gives the material the ability to discriminate C6 alkane isomers based on different gate&#8208;opening behaviors. Thus, the PCP has potential applications in C6 isomer separation, a critical step in the petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating.

      <title>Electrochemical Arylation of Aldehydes, Ketones and Alcohols: from Cathodic Reduction to Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Arylation of carbonyls, as one of the most common synthetic approaches toward the preparation of alcohols, has received sustained attention since alcohols are important feedstock and building blocks in organic synthesis. Despite recent progress in this field, there remains a considerable challenge to develop an ideal arylation method which features: mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and readily available starting materials. Herein we show that electrochemical arylation can meet this challenge.

      <title>Unveiling the In Situ Dissolution and Polymerization of Mo in Ni4Mo Alloy for Promoting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>NiMo alloys are efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolyzer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Metals are usually considered to be stable during the cathodic process. However, the actual behaviors of Mo in the NiMo alloys are unexplored. Here, we present the instability of Mo in the Ni  4  Mo alloy as a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. Our results reveal that Mo in Ni  4  Mo is oxidized and dissolved in the form of MoO  4  2&#8208;  first. The dissolved MoO  4  2&#8208;  will re&#8208;adsorb on the electrode surface and polymerize. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption of the dimer Mo  2  O  7  2&#8208;  can promote the HER activity of metal Ni. The addition of MoO  4  2&#8208;  to the electrolyte can not only repair the durability of Ni  4  Mo alloy, but also facilitate the HER activity of pure metal of Ni, Fe, and Co. Our findings provide a unique insight into the structural transformation mechanism and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of cathodic materials under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A rational design on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Numerous works have been devoted to understanding the cation leaching and surface reconstruction of some very active electrocatalysts, while few have been on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion.

The depletion of Cr and consumption of lattice oxygen facilitate surface defects and oxygen vacancies, exposing Co species to reconstruct into active Co oxyhydroxides differ from CoOOH.

      <title>In situ Construction of Robust Biphasic Surface Layers on Li Metal for Li&#8208;S Batteries with Long Cycle Life</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery show application prospect as a high energy density battery system. However, lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates can easily shuttle to Li anode and severely react with Li metal, which deplete the active materials and cause the rapid failure of batteries, remaining a great barrier for their practical application. Herein, a facile solution&#8208;pretreatment method for Li anodes with metal&#8208;fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide solution is developed to in situ construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs), which are consist of lithiophilic alloy (Li  x  M) and LiF phases on Li metal to efficiently inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li&#8208;S batteries.  The BSLs with good Li  +  transport ability and mechanical property can not only efficiently inhibit the dendrite growth, but also shield the Li anodes from the corrosion reaction with LiPSs. The Li&#8208;S batteries with such BSLs&#8208;Li anodes show the excellent cycling number over 1000 cycles at 1 C, and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2%. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, we propose a new  synergetic  mechanism  based on the robust BSLs and metal&#8208;S bond repulsion&#8208;space shield for inhibiting the shuttle effect, which is an efficient strategy for achieving high stability Li&#8208;S batteries and other metal battery systems.</dc:description>

The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production  with tunable ratio  of CO/H  2  and efficient oxidation of  amine  s to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn  2  S  4  , as well as the  optimized adsorption strength for key  reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. We also demonstrate  a synergistic interplay  between CO  2  reduction and amine dehydrogenation oxidation, rather than simply collecting these two single half&#8208;reactions in this dual&#8208;functional photoredox system.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly of &#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl Nitriles via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
      <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl nitriles are important structural motifs for pharmaceutical design. The known methods for direct synthesis of these compounds via coupling with (hetero)aryl halides suffer from narrow reaction scope. Herein we report that the combination of copper salts and oxalic diamides enables the coupling of a variety of (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br) and ethyl cyanoacetate complete under mild conditions, affording &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylacetonitriles via one&#8208;pot decarboxylation. Additionally, the CuBr/oxalic diamide catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted ethyl cyanoacetates proceed smoothly at 60 oC, leading to the formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl (hetero)arylacetonitriles after decarboxylation. The method features a general substrate scope, compatible with various functionalities and heteroaryls.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss Achieved by a Pyridine&#8208;based Dopant&#8208;free Polymer Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>Currently, the further performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (  V  OC  ) loss caused by the detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein, we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes inside perovskite and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole transporting material (HTM), i. e.  PPY2  , which exhibits suitable energy levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb  2+  and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of high quality polycrystalline perovskite film. In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using  PPY2  as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41% with a small  V  OC  loss (0.40 eV), among the best device performance for inverted PVSCs reported so far. Furthermore,  PPY2  &#8208;based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long&#8208;term photostability, and over 97% of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun constant illumination for 500 h.</dc:description>
