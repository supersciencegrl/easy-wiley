         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Doping in Flexible Organic Crystals for Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic single crystals (OSCs) with excellent flexible behavior and unique optical properties are of great importance due to their broad applicability in optical/optoelectronic devices and sensors. Nevertheless, fabricating flexible OSCs with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a host&#8208;guest doping strategy to achieve both the RTP and flexible properties of OSCs. The single&#8208;stranded crystal is highly bendable upon external force and able to immediately return to its original straight shape after the removal of stress, impressively emitting bright deep&#8208;red phosphorescence. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the bright RTP arises from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the triphenylene molecules to the dopants. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a universal approach for the preparation of flexible OSCs with RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Charges&#8208;Enhanced Molybdenum Disulfide Nanozyme Activity for Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deficient catalytic activity of nanozyme and insufficient endogenous H2O2 in tumor microenvironment (TME) are major obstacles for nanozyme&#8208;mediated catalytic tumor therapy. Herein, since electron transfer is the basic essence of catalysis&#8208;mediated redox reaction, we explored the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on positive and negative charges, which are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to enhance the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of MoS2 nanozyme. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and ultrasound&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (BTO/MoS2@CA) is presented by making few&#8208;layer MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of piezoelectric tetragonal barium titanate (T&#8208;BTO) and modified with pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive CA&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, ultrasound&#8208;mediated charges enhanced enzymatic activity and GSH depletion enables out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis with minimal side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermally Triggered Copper Payload Release for Cuproptosis&#8208;Promoted Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and exhibits enormous potential in cancer treatment. However, reducing the undesirable Cu ion release in normal tissue and maximizing the Cu&#8208;induced therapeutic effect in cancer sites are two main challenges. Herein, we constructed a photothermally triggered nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) to realize the on&#8208;demand delivery for synergistic therapy. The released DSF chelated with Cu2+ in situ to generate the high cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)&#8208;copper (CuET) causing cell apoptosis and formed Cu+ species promoting toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. Synergistic with photothermal therapy, the Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF could effectively kill the tumor cell and inhibit tumor growth (inhibition rate up to 80.1%). These results provide a promising perspective for potential cancer treatment based on cuproptosis, and also inspire the design of advanced nano&#8208;therapeutic platforms.</dc:description>

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Laboratory of Electrochemistry, Electroanalytic, and Sensor Development (LEEDS), Department of Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas, Brazil. They recently published an article about the origin of the zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion prepared without passivating agents, with a minimal number of functional groups, and using concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Ammonia transfers electrons to graphite and raises the Fermi level of the carbon material above the original value. This electron excess generates the negative zeta potential, therefore it accounts for colloidal stability. &#8220;The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by the Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite&#8221;, J.&#8197;P.&#8197;V.

         <title>Mechanistic Elucidations of Highly Dispersed Metalloporphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed iron&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (PCN&#8208;222(Fe)) on carbon&#8208;based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1 wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN&#8208;222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8211;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate&#8208;limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from &#8208;0.6 V to &#8208;1.0 V vs. RHE. Our results demonstrate how intrinsic catalytic investigations and in situ spectroscopy are needed to elucidate CO2 electroreduction mechanisms on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) MOFs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well-dispersed iron-porphyrin-based MOF (PCN-222(Fe)) on carbon-based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1 wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN-222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8211;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN-222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate-limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from -0.6 V to -1.0 V vs. RHE.

         <title>Machine Learning Informs RNA&#8208;Binding Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule targeting of RNA has emerged as a new frontier in medicinal chemistry, but compared to the protein targeting literature our understanding of chemical matter that binds to RNA is limited. In this study, we reported Repository Of BInders to Nucleic acids (ROBIN), a new library of nucleic acid binders identified by small molecule microarray (SMM) screening. The complete results of 36 individual nucleic acid SMM screens against a library of 24,572 small molecules were reported (including a total of 1,627,072 interactions assayed). A set of 2,003 RNA&#8208;binding small molecules was identified, representing the largest fully public, experimentally derived library of its kind to date. Machine learning was used to develop highly predictive and interpretable models to characterize RNA&#8208;binding molecules. This work demonstrates that machine learning algorithms applied to experimentally derived sets of RNA binders are a powerful method to inform RNA&#8208;targeted chemical space.</dc:description>

The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 is identified and the pathway is characterized by heterologous expression. We characterized a haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like terpene cyclase AncC that biosynthesizes the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;albicanol (2) from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Biochemical characterization of AncC, including kinetic studies and mutagenesis, demonstrated the functions of two domains &#8211; a terpene cyclase (TC) and a pyrophosphatase (PPase). The TC domain first cyclizes FPP to albicanoyl pyrophosphate and the PPase domain then removes the pyrophosphate forming 2. Intriguingly, AncA (94% sequence identity to AncC), in the same gene cluster, converts FPP to (R)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#947;&#8208;monocyclofarnesol instead of 2. Notably, Y283/F375 in the TC domain of AncA serve as a gatekeeper in controlling the formation of cyclofarnesoid rather than drimane&#8208;type scaffold.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The hydroxylation of fatty acids&#160;is an appealing reaction in synthetic chemistry, although the lack of selective catalysts hampers its industrial implementation. Here, we have engineered a highly regioselective fungal peroxygenase for the&#160;w&#8208;1 hydroxylation of fatty acids with quenched stepwise over&#8208;oxidation. One single mutation&#160;near the Phe catalytic tripod narrowed the heme cavity, promoting a dramatic shift toward sub&#8208;terminal hydroxylation with a drop in the over&#8208;oxidation activity.

         <title>Circular upcycling of bottlebrush thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inability to re&#8208;process thermosets hinders their utility and sustainability. An ideal material should be able to combine both closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling capabilities, thus providing a circular materials platform. This concept is realized in bottlebrush thermosets through dynamic covalent crosslinking. The polydimethylsiloxane networks described herein use thermoreversible Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions to demonstrate their ability to both reversibly disassemble into a polymer melt and/or reconfigure on&#8208;demand to an elastomer of either lower or higher stiffness. To accomplish these functions, the crosslink density was tuned by loading the functionalized networks with a controlled fraction of dormant crosslinkers and crosslinker scavengers, such as furan&#8208;capped bis&#8208;maleimide and anthracene, respectively. The resulting modulus variations precisely followed the stoichiometry of activated furan and maleimide moieties, demonstrating the lack of deleterious side reactions during reprocessing. The presented circularity concept is independent from the backbone or side chain chemistry, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of brush&#8208;like polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics and Proton Conduction of Heterogeneously Confined Imidazole in Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square&#8208;shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole. The dimensions and geometry of the nanochannels play an important role in both the shielding of the blocking effect from attractive surfaces and the frustration filling of the internal proton carrier molecules, ultimately contributing to the fast dynamics and enhanced proton conductivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square-shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core-shell-cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole.

         <title>Mechanical Training Enabled Reinforcement of Polyrotaxane&#8208;Containing Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many strategies have been developed for constructing anisotropic hydrogels, however, it remains a challenge to fabricate hydrogels with anisotropic nanocrystalline domains from intrinsically soft networks. Here, we report a naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel that can be reinforced via mechanical training. During the training process, the hydrogel can adopt reorientation of polymer chains to form anisotropic structures driven by external uniaxial force. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding sites and movable feature of naphthotube, the sliding of naphthotube on PEG chains simultaneously inducing the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form densely anisotropic nanocrystalline domains through hydrogen bonded networks. Thus, the trained hydrogel exhibits an enhanced tension stress of ~110 kPa, which realize a remarkable enhancement of ~10 times compare to initial state. This study provides a new tactic for improving the mechanical performance of soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic K+ Channels Constructed by Rebuilding the Core Modules of Natural K+ Channels in an Artificial System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different types of natural K+ channels share similar core modules and cation permeability characteristics. In this study, we have developed novel artificial K+ channels by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems. All the channels displayed high selectivity for K+ over Na+ and exhibited a selectivity sequence of K+ &#8776; Rb+ during the transport process, which is highly consistent with the cation permeability characteristics of natural K+ channels. More importantly, these artificial channels could be efficiently inserted into cell membranes and mediate the transmembrane transport of K+, disrupting the cellular K+ homeostasis and eventually triggering the apoptosis of cells. These findings demonstrate that, by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems, the structures, transport behaviors, and physiological functions of natural K+ channels can be mimicked in synthetic channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Detection of Fe(VI) Water Oxidation Intermediates in an Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In situ detection of highly&#8208;oxidized metal intermediates is the key to identifying the active center of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, but it remains challenging for NiFe&#8208;based catalysts in an aqueous solution under working conditions. Here, by utilizing the dynamic stability of the Fe(VI)O42&#8208; intermediates in a self&#8208;healing water oxidation cycle of NiFe&#8208;based catalyst, the highly&#8208;oxidized Fe(VI) intermediates leached into the electrolyte are directly detected by simple spectroelectrochemistry. Our results provide direct evidence that Fe is the active center in NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. Furthermore, it is revealed that the incorporation of Co into NiFe&#8208;based catalyst facilitates the formation of Fe(VI) active species, thus enhancing the OER activity of NiCoFe&#8208;based catalyst. The insights into the mechanisms for the sustainable generation of Fe(VI) active species in these NiFe&#8208;based catalysts lay the foundation for the design of more efficient and stable OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Thiolate&#8208;Bound Dimanganese Cluster as a Structural and Functional Model for Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In class Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8210;) rather than dioxygen (O2), to access a high valent MnIII&#8210;O2&#8210;MnIV species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate&#8208;bound dimanganese complex [MnII2(BPMT)(OAc)2](ClO)4 (BPMT = (2,6&#8208;bis{[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}&#8208;4&#8208;methylthiophenolate) (1) and its reaction with O2&#8226;&#8210; to form a [(BPMT)MnO2Mn]2+ complex 2. Resonance Raman investigation reveals the presence of an O&#8210;O bond in 2, while EPR analysis displays a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 signal at g=2 typically associated with a MnIIIMnIV core, as detected in class Ib RNR. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8210;O2&#8210;Mn complexes, generated by O2&#8226;&#8210; activation at Mn2 centers, 2 proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, thereby, making it one of the best structural and functional models for class Ib RNRs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is essential to create organic compounds that exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Helicene&#8208;type emitters possess appealing chiroptical features, however, such NIR molecules are scarce due to a paucity of synthetic strategies. Herein, we developed a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8211;O&#8211;B bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY analogs that were synthesized conveniently. The reaction of diimino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo with a heteroaromatic amine produced a restricted ligand cavity, which triggered off the generation of a B&#8211;O&#8211;B bridge. The B&#8211;O&#8211;B bridge led to distorted conformations that satisfy the helical requirements, resulting in excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties. Tunable CPL with the highest luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL = 11.5 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) in the NIR region was achieved. This synthetic approach is expected to offer a new opportunity to chiral chemistry and increase flexibility for chiroptical tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>Propargyl Alcohols as Bifunctional Reagents for Divergent Annulations of Biphenylamines via Dual C&#8208;H Functionalization/Dual Oxidative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum leap in the field of C&#8208;H functionalization has expediently provided comprehensive solutions to access valuable molecules that previously required convoluted synthetic attempts. Dual C&#8208;H functionalization, unsymmetrically, with a single bifunctional reagent is an incisive tactic. Propargyl alcohols (PAs), despite containing reactive C&#8801;C bond, were not however explored as building blocks via oxidative cleavage. Annulations via C&#8208;H activation orchestrate versatile and synthetically attractive strategies. In this unprecedented work, we disclose PA as a new bifunctional reagent for unsymmetrical dual C&#8208;H functionalization of biphenylamine for regioselectively annulated outcomes. On tuning conditions, the annulation bifurcated towards an unusual dual oxidative cyclization. The methodology accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Ferroelectric 2D Perovskite for Improving the Efficiency of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Over 23%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great progress of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs), it still faces several challenges during the homogeneous fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, and overcoming the insufficient exciton dissociation. To the ends, we rationally design the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite based on pyridine heterocyclic ring as the organic interlayer. Through regulating its dipole moment by attaching the ammounium cation on different positions of the pyridine ring, we succeed to realize the ferroelectricity of the 2D perovskite. We uncover that incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field (BEF), which enhances the exciton dissociation efficiency and suppresses the nonradiative recombination in the device. Moreover, the 2D seeds could assist the 3D crystallization process by forming more homogeneous and highly&#8208;oriented perovskite crystals, and releasing the tensile stress in the film. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 23% has been achieved by the 2D/3D based f&#8208;PSCs with outstanding ambient stability. Moreover, the ferroelectric 2D perovskite shows piezoelectricity as well, which intrigues an upshifted band&#8208;bending at the ITO/perovskite interface and decreased hole transport barriers. The device thus presents higher PCE under tensile&#8208;stresses, which opens new possibilities for developing highly&#8208;efficient f&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral dearomatization transforms biaryls into complex spirocycles commonly found in bioactive natural products. This polarity mismatched radical spirocyclization tolerates diverse functional groups and is applied in the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones. The first synthesis of denobilone A, a cytotoxic plant metabolite, showcases its utility to access underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Chiral Bimetallic Ag22Cu7 Superatom with Multiple Chirality Origins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the origin of chirality in the nanostructured materials is essential for chiroptical and catalytic applications. Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6](PPh4), Ag22Cu7, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag17Cu2 core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)2, four &#8208;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag5Cu4(C&#8801;CR)10(PPh3)5Cl4. Structural analysis reveals that Ag22Cu7 exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal&#8208;ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of R/S&#8208;Ag22Cu7 are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that Ag22Cu7 is an eight&#8208;electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Molecular Junction Covalent Organic Frameworks for Full Reaction Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2 that can combine water&#8208;oxidation and oxygen&#8208;reduction without sacrificial agents is highly demanded to maximize the light&#8208;utilization and overcome the complex reaction&#8208;process of traditional anthraquinone&#8208;oxidation. Here, a kind of oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling of tetrathiafulvalene (photo&#8208;oxidation site) and benzothiazole (photo&#8208;reduction site), which presents visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and suitable photo&#8208;redox sites that enables full reaction generation of H2O2. Specifically, a record&#8208;high yield (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, ~276,000 &#181;M/h/g) for H2O2 photosynthesis without sacrificial agents has been achieved among porous crystalline photocatalysts, which is ~10 times higher than single linkers or physical&#8208;mixture. Noteworthy, it enables the facile generation of high concentration H2O2 (~18.7 wt%) in long time batch&#8208;experiment, holding much potential in practical applications. As proved by theoretical calculations, the oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction can facilitate the charge&#8208;transfer and largely reduce the energy&#8208;barriers of both WOR and ORR to boost the performance.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Mapping of Membrane Proteins on Synaptic Vesicles using Spectrally Encoded Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatial resolution of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy is limited by the photon number of a single switching event because of the difficulty of correlating switching events dispersed in time. Here we overcome this limitation by developing a new class of photoswitching semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) with structured and highly dispersed single&#8208;particle spectra. We imaged the Pdots at the first and the second vibronic emission peaks and used the ratio of peak intensities as a spectral coding. By correlating switching events using the spectral coding and performing 4&#8211;9 frame binning, we achieved a 2&#8208;3 fold experimental resolution improvement versus conventional superresolution imaging. We applied this method to count and map SV2 and proton ATPase proteins on synaptic vesicles (SVs). The results reveal that these proteins are trafficked and organized with high precision, showing unprecedented level of detail about the composition and structure of SVs.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;linkage strategy to make single crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) gives porous solids with gigantic Al24 units. Selective linkage replacement rigidifies the MOFs resulting in outstanding water&#8208;harvesting behaviour. The selective linkage dissociation of the MOF provides a new route to prepare highly symmetrical clusters.







Abstract
In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8208;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8208;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8208;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM=Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed nitrogen cycle utilizing electrochemical processes can be established between N2, NH3, and HNO3. Four essential reactions constitute an overall picture of the nitrogen transformation system, which facilitates the realization of a global carbon&#8208;free green energy network, and remedies the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle, along with the concomitant environmental crisis.







Abstract
Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable nitrogen economy. Synergistically combining multiple nitrogen reactions can realize efficient renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises. Here, we provide a unique aspect to discuss the intriguing nitrogen electrochemistry by linking three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8722;) and integrating four essential electrochemical reactions, i.e., the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). This minireview also summarizes the acquired knowledge of rational catalyst design and underlying reaction mechanisms for these interlinked nitrogen reactions. We further underscore the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.

         <title>Increasing Molecular Planarity through Donor/Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Improved NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy under 1064&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a simple strategy based on molecular planarity to design a high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type conjugated small molecule with both intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and robust energy output. The resulting probe was used for 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;triggered NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and dual&#8208;mode imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Developing conjugated small molecules (CSM) with intense NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) absorption for phototheranostic is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to a lack of reliable design guidelines. This study reports a high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CSM for phototheranostic by tailoring molecular planarity. A series of CSM show bathochromic absorption extended to the NIR&#8208;II region upon the increasing thiophene number, but an excessive number of thiophene results in decreased NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1400&#8197;nm) brightness and photothermal effects. Further introduction of terminal nonconjugated alkyl chain can enhance NIR&#8208;II absorption coefficient, NIR&#8208;IIa brightness, and photothermal effects. Mechanism studies ascribe this overall enhancement to molecular planarity stemming from the collective contribution of donor/side&#8208;chain engineering. This finding directs the design of NIR&#8208;II CSM by rational manipulating molecular planarity to perform 1064&#8197;nm mediated phototheranostic at high efficiency.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H Functionalization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides with Thianthrenium Salts: Conjugation and Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides bears enormous potential for drug discovery and molecular imaging, among others. Herein, we report on a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with easily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts. Under exceedingly mild reaction conditions the late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides was accomplished. The tunability and ease of preparation of arylthianthrenium salts allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages. The robustness of the palladium catalysis regime was reflected by the full tolerance of a plethora of sensitive and coordinating functional groups. Hence, our manifold enabled efficient access to highly decorated, labelled, conjugated, and ligated linear and cyclic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Transmembrane Transport of Exogenous Lithium Ions through Rationally Designed Supramolecular Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial Li+ channels composed of pore&#8208;forming small aromatic molecules show almost exclusive transport of exogenous lithium ions over major physiological cations, with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium ions have been applied in the clinic in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this work, we report artificial supramolecular lithium channels composed of pore&#8208;containing small aromatic molecules. By adjusting the lumen size and coordination numbers, we found that one of the supramolecular channels developed shows unprecedented transmembrane transport of exogenous lithium ions with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0, which is in the same level of that of natural Na+ channels. Furthermore, four coordination sites inside channels are found to be the basic requirement for ion transport function. Importantly, this artificial lithium channel displays very low transport of physiological Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions, especially in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and peptide therapies are expanding for disease treatment, and the development of non&#8208;invasive or mini&#8208;invasive delivery systems is essential to improve patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes. This review provides an overview of recent advances in materials, formulations, and technologies developed to overcome biological barriers to the oral and transdermal delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily implemented membrane&#8208;receptor&#8208;analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, combining the concepts of single&#8208;molecule localization and random sampling, is reported. Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single&#8208;molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling&#8208;based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer&#8208;based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer&#8208;receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer&#8208;based dynamics analysis of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.

         <title>Expediting Oxygen Evolution by Optimizing Cation and Anion Complexity in Electrocatalysts Based on Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purposely changing the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge for enhancing the energy efficiency of electrochemical splitting of water. Here we show that the OER RDS can be regulated by simply varying the cation and anion complexity in a family of the metal phosphorous trichalcogenide electrocatalysts (MPT3, where M = Fe, Ni; T = S, Se), achieving an exceptionally high OER activity in (Ni,Fe)P(S,Se)3, as demonstrated by its ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34 mV dec&#8208;1) and a very low overpotential compared to many relevant OER catalysts. This is strongly supported by density functional theory calculations, which showed that this catalyst has a nearly optimal OER activity descriptor value of &#916;G(O*) &#8211; &#916;G(OH*) = 1.5 eV. We also found that the activity descriptor is proportional to a newly proposed cation/anion complexity index that consists of pairwise contributions from cation&#8208;anion bonds in a catalyst compound, revealing the pivotal role of the cation&#8208;anion interactions in determining the catalyst performance and providing a simple way for predicting catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Type 1 Aldolase, NahE, Catalyzes a Stereoselective Nitro&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective Michael addition of pyruvate to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes catalyzed by NahE, a type 1 aldolase, is reported. &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids can be isolated after oxidative decarboxylation in high yields on a preparative scale, providing access to precursors of &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogues of demonstrated pharmacological activity.







Abstract
Michael addition reactions are highly useful in organic synthesis and are commonly accomplished using organocatalysts. However, the corresponding biocatalytic Michael additions are rare, typically lack synthetically useful substrate scope, and suffer from low stereoselectivity. Herein we report a biocatalytic nitro&#8208;Michael addition, catalyzed by NahE, that proceeds with low catalyst loading at room temperature in moderate to excellent enantioselectivity and high yields. A series of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes reacted with pyruvate in the presence of NahE to give, after oxidative decarboxylation, &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids in up to 99&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography, providing a simple preparative&#8208;scale route to chiral GABA analogues. This reaction represents the first example of an aldolase displaying promiscuous Michaelase activity and opens the use of nitroalkenes in place of aldehydes as substrates for aldolases.

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;bond&#8208;forming dimerization to afford the didepside lecanoric acid is shown to require both the starter acyltransferase and the thioesterase domains of the nonreducing polyketide synthase Preu6 of the fungus Preussia isomera. These domains also engage in an unexpected, direct protein&#8211;protein interaction that must be considered when attempting combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.







Abstract
Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides, such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram the ketide homologation chassis to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8211;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered for the combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.

         <title>Cadmium&#8208;Doped and Pincer Ligand&#8208;Modified Gold Nanocluster for Catalytic KA2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 with an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two PNP pincer ligands and two Au2Cd(SR)6 staple motifs has been developed as an efficient catalyst for the KA2 reaction. The cooperation between the three parts of the gold nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high activity.







Abstract
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 (PNP=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR=4&#8208;MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two Au2CdS6 staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co&#8208;modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA2 reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co&#8208;existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.

         <title>Designing Solid Electrolyte Interfaces towards Homogeneous Na Deposition: Theoretical Guidelines for Electrolyte Additives and Superior High&#8208;Rate Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) electrolyte additive is developed to accelerate Na ion diffusion through the solid electrolyte interphase layer and induce spherical Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode due to the derived NaBr with high ionic conductivity. As enabled by the 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising metal anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth lead to disastrous short circuit and poor cycle life. Through phase field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, we first predict that the sodium bromide (NaBr) with the lowest Na ion diffusion energy barrier among sodium halogen compounds (NaX, X=F, Cl, Br, I) is the ideal SEI composition to induce the spherical Na deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Then, 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr&#8208;rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94&#8201;% is achieved after 2000&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 10&#8197;C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.

         <title>Correlating Oxidation State and Surface Ligand Motifs with the Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface oxidation state of titanium oxynitride photocatalysts influences C2 product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction. The surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state can be regulated and controlled through the concentration of nitrogen dopant and oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The design for non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based catalysts with the function of producing C2+ products requires systematic knowledge of the intrinsic connection between the surface state as well as the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this work, photochemical in situ spectral surface characterization techniques combined with the first principle calculations (DFT) were applied to investigate the relationships between the composition of surface states, coordinated motifs, and catalytic selectivity of a titanium oxynitride catalyst. When the catalyst mediates CO2 photoreduction, C2 product selectivity is positively correlated with the surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state is regulated and controlled by coordinated motifs of N&#8722;Ti&#8208;O/V[O], which can reduce the potential dimerization energy barriers of *CO&#8722;CO* and promote spontaneous formation of the subsequent *CO&#8722;CH2* intermediate. This phenomenon provides a new perspective for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for photoreduction of CO2 into useful products.

         <title>Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport Across Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductance of molecular junctions bridged in Pt&#8208; or Pd&#8208;adlayer modified Au electrodes was investigated. The conductance on bimetallic electrodes was found 2&#8211;30 fold higher than that on Au electrodes. This was attributed to the increase in the local density of states by partially&#8208;filled d shells of the adlayer.







Abstract
Fermi's golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial electron&#8208;transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of states (SDOS). Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single&#8208;molecule junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions. At the Fermi level, however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d&#8208;shell. To increase the electron&#8208;transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d&#8208;shells and exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy. An increase by 2&#8211;30 fold is found for single&#8208;molecule conductance of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hexanes bridged via common headgroups. The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self&#8208;energy which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS participated by d&#8208;electrons at the electrode&#8208;molecule interfaces.

         <title>Pore Geometry and Surface Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Anhydrous Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three robust and porous covalent organic frameworks with rare concave dodecagonal nanopores were designed and synthesized via a pore engineering approach. The fine&#8208;tailored and functionalized pored can anchor H3PO4 molecules to form abundant proton hopping sites, thus affording high proton conductivity at anhydrous conditions.







Abstract
Developing new materials for anhydrous proton conduction under high&#8208;temperature conditions is significant and challenging. Herein, we create a series of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a pore engineering approach. We simultaneously engineer the pore geometry (generating concave dodecagonal nanopores) and pore surface (installing multiple functional groups such as &#8722;C=N&#8722;, &#8722;OH, &#8722;N=N&#8722; and &#8722;CF3) to improve the utilization efficiency and host&#8211;guest interaction of proton carriers, hence benefiting the enhancement of anhydrous proton conduction. Upon loading with H3PO4, COFs can realize a proton conductivity of 2.33&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under anhydrous conditions, among the highest values of all COF materials. These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membranes.

         <title>Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Imaging and Laparotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging holds high potential for sensitive imaging of cancer due to its low background; however, few NIR chemiluminophores are available, which share the drawback of low chemiluminescence quantum yield (&#934;CL). Herein, we report the development of two NIR chemiluminophores for cancer imaging and laparotomy. Molecular engineering of electron&#8208;withdraw group at the para position phenol&#8208;dioxetane leads to a highly bright NIR chemiluminophores, TCM&#8208;phenoxy&#8208;dioxetane (DPT), showing the &#934;CL (4.6 &#215;10&#8208;2 Einsteins/mol) 3 to 5&#8208;fold higher than all existing NIR chemiluminophores. By caging the phenol group of DPT with a cathepsin B (CatB) responsive moiety, an activatable chemiluminescence probe (DPTCB) is developed for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice. Due to its high brightness, DPTCB permit accurate chemiluminescence&#8208;guided laparotomy.</dc:description>

         <title>Verifying the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Using Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is flourishing in photocatalysis because of the concurrent realization of separated charge carriers and sufficient redox ability. The steady&#8208;state charge transfer has been confirmed by other methods. However, an essential part, the transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, is still missing. To compensate, a series of cadmium sulphide/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole heterojunctions are constructed and the photophysical processes are investigated through femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Encouragingly, an interfacial charge transfer signal is detected in the spectra of heterojunction, which provides solid evidence for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer to complement the results from well&#8208;established methods. Further, the lifetime for interfacial charge transfer is calculated to be ~78.6 ps. Moreover, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;diols conversion and H2 production rates than bare cadmium sulphide.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence of Sulfur Non&#8208;Innocence in [CoII(dithiacyclam)]2+&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison of the abilities of two CoII complexes bearing N4 and S2N2 ligations to mediate 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the reactive intermediates point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
In many metalloenzymes, sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8208;ligation in cobalt mediated oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (1; cyclam=1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) and the S&#8208;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (2; S2N2&#8208;cyclam=1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the CoII centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.

         <title>Emergence of Visible&#8208;Light Water Oxidation Upon Hexaniobate&#8208;Ligand Entrapment of Quantum&#8208;Confined Copper&#8208;Oxide Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of small 1 to 3 nm organic&#8208;ligand free metal&#8208;oxide nanocrystals (NCs) is essential to utilization of their attractive size&#8208;dependent properties in electronic devices and catalysis. We now report that hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anions, [Nb  6  O  19  ]  8&#8208;  , can arrest the growth of metal&#8208;oxide NCs and stabilize them as water&#8208;soluble complexes. This is exemplified by formation of hexaniobate&#8208;complexed 2.4&#8208;nm monoclinic&#8208;phase CuO NCs (  1  ), whose ca. 350 Cu&#8208;atom cores feature quantum&#8208;confinement effects that impart an unprecedented ability to catalyze visible&#8208;light water oxidation with no added photosensitizers or applied potentials, and at rates exceeding those of hematite NCs. The findings point to polyoxoniobate&#8208;ligand entrapment as a potentially general method for harnessing the size&#8208;dependent properties of small semiconductor NCs by utilizing them as the cores of versatile, entirely&#8208;inorganic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Metal as Bioinspired and Unusual Modulator in Bioorthogonal Catalysis for Tumor Inhibition Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd&#8208;based transition metal catalysts has sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. LM matrix can serve as a &#8220;ligand&#8221; to afford an electron&#8208;rich environment to stabilize the active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the p&#8208;allylpalladium species to accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo&#8208;enhanced catalysis and photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugation extension using ring fusion, intramolecular conformational locking, and a very low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital endow the resulting 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic molecules with a record&#8208;high &#956;C* of 10.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a high electron mobility of 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
The primary challenge for n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is to improve their electron mobilities and thus the key figure of merit &#956;C*. Nevertheless, few reports in OECTs have specially proposed to address this issue. Herein, we report a 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system consisting of the core of naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin dimer and the terminal moieties of rhodanine, which features intramolecular noncovalent interactions, high &#960;&#8208;delocalization and strong electron&#8208;deficient characteristics. We find that this extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using the ring fusion strategy displays improved electron mobilities up to 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared to our previously reported small molecule gNR, and thereby leads to a remarkable &#956;C* of 10.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type OECTs, which is the highest value reported to date for small&#8208;molecule OECTs. This work highlights the importance of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension in polycyclic&#8208;fused molecules for enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OECTs.

Universal hydrogel systems built from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids could entrap charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes to enable circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive photothermal performances and gel&#8208;solution phase transition.







Abstract
Hydrogels behave as potential candidates to investigate circularly polarized light (CP)&#8208;matter interaction, which however suffer from small sensitivity towards circular polarization. Here we report a general protocol to build hydrogels from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids with coassembled charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes, covering a wide scope of donors and acceptors, which were incorporated into stable hydrogel matrices. CT complexes formed block coassemblies with gelators, induced the emergence of macroscopic chiral helices, where efficient chirality transfer occurs to realize tunable Cotton effects from visible light to NIR&#8208;I region depending on the structures of CT pairs. The hybrid hydrogels showed tunable photothermal performances with excellent heating&#8208;cooling cycling durability. Circularly polarized NIR light selectively triggered gel&#8208;solution phase transition at different timescales. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;CP illumination generates up to 2.5 folds difference in gel collapse time that allows for direct discrimination by naked eyes.

         <title>Heterogeneous Electrospinning Nanofiber Membranes with pH&#8208;regulated Ion Gating for Tunable Osmotic Power Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous electrospinning nanofiber membranes (HENMs) were constructed by electrospinning technology. HENMs demonstrate the fundamental property of ion gating, thus offering an adjustable gating effect for tunable energy conversion. This work has widespread potential for the application of smart nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and water treatment.







Abstract
Biological ion channels existing in organisms are critical for many biological processes. Inspired by biological ion channels, the heterogeneous electrospinning nanofiber membranes (HENM) with functional ion channels are constructed by electrospinning technology. The HENM successfully realizes ion&#8208;gating effects, which can be used for tunable energy conversions. Introduction of pyridine and carboxylic acid groups into the HENM plays an important role in generating unique and stable ion transport behaviors, in which gates become alternative states of open and close, responding to symmetric/asymmetric pH stimulations. Then we used the HENM to convert osmotic energy into electric energy which reach a maximum value up to 12.34&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 and the output power density of HENM&#8208;based system could be regulated by ion&#8208;gating effects. The properties of the HENM provide widespread potentials in application of smart nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and water treatment.

         <title>Remarkable White Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Based on Chiral Co&#8208;assembled Helix Nanofiber Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated main&#8208;chain pyrene&#8208;based polymers combine with rigid binaphthyl chiral inducers to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies. The obtained circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on emissive layers of chiral co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 exhibit excellent white&#8208;light quality (CRI=98) and circularly polarized electroluminescence (|gEL|=0.062) at the CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33).







Abstract
White circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs) are of great significance in potential lighting sources and full&#8208;color 3D displays. However, High&#8208;performance white CP&#8208;EL sources are almost unexplored. We have constructed full&#8208;color CP&#8208;EL devices based on chiral co&#8208;assemblies by using three achiral conjugated pyrene&#8208;based dyes (BP, w&#8208;WP and c&#8208;WP) doped with chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based enantiomers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M) as the EMLs through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 films exhibit regular helix nanofibers under annealing treatment and emit strong white CPL. Significantly, remarkable CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 were achieved with |gEL| values as high as 6.2&#215;10&#8722;2 and an excellent CRI of 98 at the CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). These are the highest gEL and CRI values of reported CP&#8208;WOLEDs to date. This is the first achievement of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on chiral co&#8208;assembled helix nanofiber emitters, and provides a valuable strategy with which to develop white CP&#8208;EL for future practical applications.

         <title>In Situ Observation of C&#8722;C Coupling and Step Poisoning During the Growth of Hydrocarbon Chains on Ni(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomistic mechanisms driving hydrocarbon chain growth on a nickel model catalyst were elucidated with a combination of surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. While the step edges of the catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for C&#8722;C coupling, this research demonstrates that polymerization occurs on the flat terrace sites.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;value fuels and plastics starting from small hydrocarbon molecules plays a central role in the current transition towards renewable energy. However, the detailed mechanisms driving the growth of hydrocarbon chains remain to a large extent unknown. Here we investigated the formation of hydrocarbon chains resulting from acetylene polymerization on a Ni(111) model catalyst surface. Exploiting X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy up to near&#8208;ambient pressures, the intermediate species and reaction products have been identified. Complementary in situ scanning tunneling microscopy observations shed light onto the C&#8722;C coupling mechanism. While the step edges of the metal catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for the C&#8722;C coupling, we showed that the polymerization occurs instead on the flat terraces of the metallic surface.

         <title>Effect of Proton Transfer on Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Manganese Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between proton transfer and water oxidation performance has been established by constructing isomorphous manganese(II) phosphates. The proton hopping pathway in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O showed a much lower energy barrier than the direct diffusion pathway in KMnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The OER reaction mechanisms are proposed and proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been straightforwardly observed and understood.







Abstract
The effect of proton transfer on water oxidation has hardly been measurably established in heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, two isomorphous manganese phosphates (NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and KMnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) were designed to form an ideal platform to study the effect of proton transfer on water oxidation. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O has been proven to be solely responsible for its better activity. The differences of the proton transfer kinetics in the two materials indicate a fast proton hopping transfer process with a low activation energy in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network can effectively promote the proton transfer between adjacent Mn sites and further stabilize the MnIII&#8722;OH intermediates. The faster proton transfer results in a higher proportion of zeroth&#8208;order in [H+] for OER. Thus, proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been measurably observed to bring detailed insights into the mechanism of water oxidation.

The differences of the proton transfer kinetics in the two materials indicate a fast proton hopping transfer process with a low activation energy in NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;MnPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. In addition, the hydrogen-bonding network can effectively promote the proton transfer between adjacent Mn sites and further stabilize the Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH intermediates. The faster proton transfer results in a higher proportion of zeroth-order in [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] for OER. Thus, proton transfer-affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been measurably observed to bring detailed insights into the mechanism of water oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A De Novo&#8208;Designed Type 3 Copper Protein Tunes Catechol Substrate Recognition and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By properly engineering the first and second coordination sphere, an artificial type&#8197;3 di&#8208;copper polyphenol oxidase was obtained. Shaping the active site accessibility, the four&#8208;helix bundle di&#8208;copper DR1 was endowed with enzyme&#8208;like substrate selectivity. DFT computations and experimental investigations showed the key role of the residues lining the active site pocket in tuning substrate recognition by weak interactions.







Abstract
De novo metalloprotein design is a remarkable approach to shape protein scaffolds toward specific functions. Here, we report the design and characterization of Due Rame&#8197;1 (DR1), a de novo designed protein housing a di&#8208;copper site and mimicking the Type&#8197;3 (T3) copper&#8208;containing polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). To achieve this goal, we hierarchically designed the first and the second di&#8208;metal coordination spheres to engineer the di&#8208;copper site into a simple four&#8208;helix bundle scaffold. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and functional characterization revealed that DR1 recapitulates the T3 copper site, supporting different copper redox states, and being active in the O2&#8208;dependent oxidation of catechols to o&#8208;quinones. Careful design of the residues lining the substrate access site endows DR1 with substrate recognition, as revealed by Hammet analysis and computational studies on substituted catechols. This study represents a premier example in the construction of a functional T3 copper site into a designed four&#8208;helix bundle protein.

         <title>Tunable Strategy for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfoglycolipids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis To Elucidate the Structure and Immunomodulatory Property Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) was developed. The strategy features a suite of asymmetrically protected trehaloses for acylation and sulfation. A practical synthetic route was explored for the preparation of polydeoxypropionate fatty acids, which together with the trehaloses enabled the synthesis of different classes of SGLs for immunological studies.







Abstract
We developed a versatile asymmetric strategy to synthesize different classes of sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The strategy features the use of asymmetrically protected trehaloses, which were acquired from the glycosylation of TMS &#945;&#8208;glucosyl acceptors with benzylidene&#8208;protected thioglucosyl donors. The positions of the protecting groups at the donors and acceptors can be fine&#8208;tuned to obtain different protecting&#8208;group patterns, which is crucial for regioselective acylation and sulfation. In addition, a chemoenzymatic strategy was established to prepare the polymethylated fatty acid building blocks. The strategy employs inexpensive lipase as a desymmetrization agent in the preparation of the starting substrate and readily available chiral oxazolidinone as a chirality&#8208;controlling agent in the construction of the polymethylated fatty acids. A subsequent investigation on the immunomodulatory properties of each class of SGLs showed how the structures of SGLs impact the host innate immunity response.

         <title>Synthesis of a Systematic 64&#8208;Membered Heparan Sulfate Tetrasaccharide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 64 heparan sulfate tetrasaccharides containing all possible arrangements of 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 6&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;sulfation with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone was successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This library enabled the determination of heparan sulfate structures for strong binding with fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 but weak binding to platelet factor&#8208;4.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) has multifaceted biological activities. To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systematically varied sulfation structures are available owing to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all possible structures of 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 6&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;sulfation with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 binding but a weak affinity for platelet factor&#8208;4. Such a strategy to separate out these two interactions could lead to new HS&#8208;based potential therapeutics without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia.

         <title>Synthetic Zwitterionic Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 1 Oligosaccharides Carrying Labile O&#8208;Acetyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly convergent and stereoselective total synthesis of zwitterionic Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharides, carrying labile O&#8208;acetyl esters, is described. Structural studies show the nonasaccharide to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure in which the acetyl groups decorating the periphery stabilize the structure.







Abstract
We herein report the first total synthesis of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharide, a unique zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide carrying labile O&#8208;acetyl esters. The target oligosaccharides, featuring rare &#945;&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy galactose (AAT) and &#945;&#8208;galacturonic acids, were assembled up to the 9&#8208;mer level, in a highly stereoselective manner using trisaccharide building blocks. The lability of the O&#8208;acetyl esters imposed a careful deprotection scheme to prevent migration and hydrolysis. The migration was investigated in detail at various pD values using NMR spectroscopy, to show that migration and hydrolysis of the C&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl esters readily takes place under neutral conditions. Structural investigation showed the oligomers to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure with the acetyl esters exposed on the periphery of the helix in close proximity of the neighboring AAT residues, thereby imposing conformational restrictions on the AAT&#945;1&#8208;4GalA(3OAc) glycosidic linkages, supporting the helical shape of the polysaccharide, that has been proposed to be critical for its unique biological activity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Coupling of Difluoroalkenes and Aryl Boronic Acids for Ketone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative coupling reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl boronic acids affords ketones with an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. The vinyl difluoromethylene motif serves as an in situ carbonyl precursor that is unprecedented in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. The key difluoroalkyl palladium(II) RCF2&#8722;PdII intermediate and related organometallic species were fully characterized.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction is a useful approach for ketone synthesis. However, it is often problematic to use exogenous carbonyl reagents, such as gaseous carbon monoxide. In this manuscript, we report a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl boronic acids that yields bioactive indane&#8208;type ketones with an all&#8208;carbon &#945;&#8208;quaternary center. Characterization and stoichiometric reactions of the key intermediates RCF2PdII support a water&#8208;induced defluorination and cross&#8208;coupling cascade mechanism. The vinyl difluoromethylene motif serves as an in situ carbonyl precursor which is unprecedented in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. It is expected to raise broad research interest from the perspectives of ketone synthesis, fluoroalkene functionalization, and rational design of new synthetic protocols based on the unique reactivity of difluoroalkyl palladium(II) species.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Double Hydrosilylation of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes involving unique hydrosilylation of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylsilane intermediates has been developed, to regioselectively access vicinal and geminal bis(silane)s bearing silicon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. These valuable bis(silyl) compounds can be used as polymerizable monomers for the synthesis of polymers possessing high refractive indices up to 1.83.







Abstract
Double hydrosilylation of alkynes represents a straightforward method to synthesize bis(silane)s, yet it is challenging if &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylsilanes act as the intermediates. Here, a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes is reported for the first time involving this challenge, accessing both vicinal and geminal bis(silane)s with exclusive regioselectivity. Various novel bis(silane)s containing Si&#8722;H bonds can be easily obtained. The gram&#8208;scale reactions could be performed smoothly. Preliminarily mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reactions were initiated by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of alkynes, followed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydrosilylation of the &#945;&#8208;vinylsilanes to deliver vicinal bis(silane)s, or hydride&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation to give geminal ones. Notably, these bis(silane)s can be used for the synthesis of high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index polymers (nd up to 1.83), demonstrating great potential utility in optical materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Enamides to Construct &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes with Vicinal Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
A rhodium complex bearing a chiral phosphite ligand catalyzes the hydrosilylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enamides to afford valuable &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes in a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. Stereodivergent synthesis is achieved by regulating substrate geometry and ligand enantiomer to generate all the possible stereoisomers in high enantio&#8208;purity.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the area of catalytic alkene hydrosilylation, the enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkenes bearing a heteroatom substituent is scarce. Here we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enamides to directly afford valuable &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes in a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. Stereodivergent synthesis could be achieved by regulating substrate geometry and ligand configuration to generate all the possible stereoisomers in high enantio&#8208;purity.

         <title>Hewettite ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O with Remarkably Stable Layers and Ultralarge Interlayer Spacing for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via an ion exchange induced phase transformation, A2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K) was transformed to hewettite BV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O (B=Zn, Mg, Ca, Cu), accompanied by reconstruction of the layers and expansion of interlayer spacing. Benefiting from the remarkably stable layers and ultralarge interlayer spacing, the ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O cathode exhibits an ultralong life and ultrahigh rate capability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, substantially better than AVO.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their intrinsic safety, low&#8208;cost and high energy&#8208;intensity. Vanadium&#8208;based materials are widely used as the cathode of ZIBs, especially A2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K). However, AVO suffers from serious dissolution, phase transformation and narrow gallery spacing (&#8764;3&#8197;&#197;), leading to poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we unveiled the root cause of the performance degradation in the AVO cathode and therefore developed a new high&#8208;performance cathode of ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O (ZVO) for ZIB. Through a method of ion exchange induced phase transformation, AVO was converted to hewettite ZVO with larger gallery spacing (&#8764;6&#8197;&#197;) and more stable V6O16 layers. ZVO cathode thus constructed delivers a high capacity of 365 and 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 and 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1, while 86&#8201;% and 70&#8201;% of its capacity are retained at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles and at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10000&#8197;cycles, substantially better than conventional AVO.

IPC&#8208;1P, a layered zeolite precursor with a relatively high density of surface silanols can be swollen using docosyltrimethylammonium hydroxide and functionalized with ultra&#8208;small Rh nanoparticles. The resulting mesoporous zeolitic material Rh@IPC_C22 has a high layer disordering without microporosity. In situ STEM imaging during heating and DFT simulations show strong metal&#8208;silanol interactions stabilizing Rh nanoparticles against thermal sintering.







Abstract
Supported metal nanoparticles are used as heterogeneous catalysts but often deactivated due to sintering at high temperatures. Confining metal species into a porous matrix reduces sintering, yet supports rarely provide additional stabilization. Here, we used the silanol&#8208;rich layered zeolite IPC&#8208;1P to stabilize ultra&#8208;small Rh nanoparticles. By adjusting the IPC&#8208;1P interlayer space through swelling, we prepared various architectures, including microporous and disordered mesoporous. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed that Rh nanoparticles are resistant to sintering at high temperature (750&#8201;&#176;C, 6&#8197;hrs). Rh clusters strongly bind to surface silanol quadruplets at IPC&#8208;1P layers by hydrogen transfer to clusters, while high silanol density hinders their migration based on density functional theory calculations. Ultimately, combining swelling with long&#8208;chain surfactant and utilizing metal&#8208;silanol interactions resulted in a novel, catalytically active material&#8212;Rh@IPC_C22.

         <title>Ordered Macro/Microporous Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Toxic Pollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charged ordered macro&#8208;micro hierarchical porous organic framework with grafted viologen units is synthesized by a solid&#8208;state acid&#8208;vapor assisted synthetic strategy. The material demonstrates faster diffusion of analytes and ultrafast adsorption potency toward a wider range of organic&#8208;inorganic toxic pollutants from water.







Abstract
In case of pollutant segregation, fast mass diffusion is a fundamental criterion in order to achieve improved performance. The rapid mass transport through porous materials can be achieved by availing large open pores followed by easy and complete accessibility of functional sites. Inducing macroporosity into such materials could serve as ideal solution providing access to large macropores that offer unhindered transport of analyte and full exposure to interactive sites. Moreover, the challenge to configure the ionic&#8208;functionality with macroporosity could emerge as an unparalleled avenue toward pollutants separation. Herein, we strategized a synthetic protocol for construction of a positively charged hierarchically&#8208;porous ordered interconnected macro&#8208;structure of organic framework where the size and number of macropores can easily be tuned. The ordered macropores with strong electrostatic interaction synergistically exhibited ultrafast removal efficiency towards various toxic pollutants.

         <title>Selective Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Azaarenes and Alkynes via Photoredox Cobalt Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed to access functionalized azaarene compounds bearing stereodefined tri&#8208;substituted alkenes via photoredox cobalt dual catalysis. Simple organic base together with alcohol has been applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this coupling reaction.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;induced Co&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed. Notably, H&#252;nig's base together with simple ethanol has been successfully applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this catalytic photoredox reaction. This approach has considerable advantages for the straightforward synthesis of stereodefined multiple substituted alkenes bearing an azaarene motif, such as excellent regioselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for &gt;30&#8197;examples) and stereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;E/Z), broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility under mild reaction conditions, which has been utilized in the concise synthesis of natural product monomorine I. A reasonable catalytic reaction pathway involving protolysis of the cobaltacyclopentene intermediate has been proposed based on the mechanistic studies.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Proteins with Base&#8208;Labile Posttranslational Modifications Enabled by a Boc&#8208;SPPS Based General Strategy Towards Peptide C&#8208;Terminal Salicylaldehyde Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Boc&#8208;SPPS based method towards the synthesis of peptide C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde esters compatible with all canonical amino acids was developed. The method could facilitate the synthesis of proteins bearing base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications, e.g., O&#8208;acetylation and S&#8208;palmitoylation.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of proteins bearing base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) is a challenging task. For instance, O&#8208;acetylation and S&#8208;palmitoylation PTMs cannot survive Fmoc removal conditions during Fmoc&#8208;solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). In this work, we developed a new Boc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;based strategy for the synthesis of peptide C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde (SAL) esters, which are the key reaction partner in Ser/Thr ligation and Cys/Pen ligation. The strategy utilized the semicarbazone&#8208;modified aminomethyl (AM) resin, which could support the Boc&#8208;SPPS and release the peptide SAL ester upon treatment with TFA/H2O and pyruvic acid. The non&#8208;oxidative aldehyde regeneration was fully compatible with all the canonical amino acids. Armed with this strategy, we finished the syntheses of the O&#8208;acetylated protein histone H3(S10ac, T22ac) and the hydrophobic S&#8208;palmitoylated peptide derived from caveolin&#8208;1.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Reservoir Hydrogel Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Term Cycling Zn/PANI Batteries in Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn/PANI battery performance in wide temperature range is boosted by a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte with 3&#8197;M Zn(ClO4)2. The &#8722;SO3&#8722;H+ groups on the polymeric acid not only act as the proton reservoir to inhibit PANI deprotonation and promote dual&#8208;ion storage, but also guide the Zn2+ deposition for dendrite suppression, thus resulting in excellent rate performance and ultra&#8208;high cycling stability in different temperatures.







Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising for next generation flexible devices owing to the high safety, yet still requiring better cycling stability and high capacities in wide temperature range. Herein, a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte (PAGE) with 3&#8197;M Zn(ClO4)2 was fabricated for high performance Zn/polyaniline (PANI) batteries. With PAGE, even at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C the Zn/Zn symmetrical battery can keep stable for more than 1&#8201;500&#8197;h under 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn/PANI battery can provide ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 79.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for more than 70&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This can be mainly ascribed to the &#8722;SO3&#8722;H+ function group in PAGE. It can generate constant protons and guide the (002) plane formation to accelerate the PANI redox reaction kinetics, increase the specific capacity, and suppress the side reaction and dendrites. This proton&#8208;supplying strategy by polymeric acid hydrogel may further propel the development of high performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Oxidation and Reduction Pathways in the Knowles Hydroamination via a Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic exploration of reaction paths based on quantum chemical calculations revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles's light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination via radical processes. The energetically favorable reaction path was determined based on the reaction path searches and the SX geometry searches. The present calculations showed that the reduction and proton transfer proceed concertedly.







Abstract
Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles's light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination. Bond formation/cleavage competes with single electron transfer (SET) between the catalyst and substrate. These processes are described by adiabatic processes through transition states in an electronic state and non&#8208;radiative transitions through the seam of crossings (SX) between different electronic states. This study determined the energetically favorable SET path by introducing a practical computational model representing SET as non&#8208;adiabatic transitions via SXs between substrate's potential energy surfaces for different charge states adjusted based on the catalyst's redox potential. Calculations showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly. Also, the relative importance of SET paths (giving the product and leading back to the reactant) varies depending on the catalyst's redox potential, affecting the yield.

         <title>Bioinspired Gradient Stretchable Aerogels for Ultrabroad&#8208;Range&#8208;Response Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Wearable Electronics and High&#8208;Efficient Separators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient, stretchable and superelastic reduced graphene oxide/polyurethane nanocomposite aerogels have been achieved by a sol&#8208;gel/hot pressing/freeze casting/ambient pressure drying strategy. The gradient aerogels can be used for high&#8208;efficient separators and wearable electronics with an ultrabroad detection range of 1&#8197;Pa&#8211;12.6&#8197;MPa and ultrahigh fatigue resistance, showing great potentials in high&#8208;performance sensors and separators.







Abstract
Broad&#8208;range&#8208;response pressure&#8208;sensitive wearable electronics are urgently needed but their preparation remains a challenge. Herein, we report unprecedented bioinspired wearable electronics based on stretchable and superelastic reduced graphene oxide/polyurethane nanocomposite aerogels with gradient porous structures by a sol&#8208;gel/hot pressing/freeze casting/ambient pressure drying strategy. The gradient structure with a hot&#8208;pressed layer promotes strain transfer and resistance variation under high pressures, leading to an ultrabroad detection range of 1&#8197;Pa&#8211;12.6&#8197;MPa, one of the broadest ranges ever reported. They can withstand 10&#8201;000 compression cycles under 1&#8197;MPa, which can't be achieved by traditional flexible pressure sensors. They can be applied for broad&#8208;range&#8208;response electronic skins and monitoring various physical signals/motions and ultrahigh pressures of automobile tires. Moreover, the gradient aerogels can be used as high&#8208;efficient gradient separators for water purification.

         <title>Atroposelective Access to 1,3&#8208;Oxazepine&#8208;Containing Bridged Biaryls via Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atroposelective synthesis of novel bridged biaryls containing 1,3&#8208;oxazepine medium&#8208;sized rings is enabled by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis. Addition of the carbene catalyst to the aminophenol&#8208;derived aldimine substrate followed by oxidation and intramolecular desymmetrization gave the desired bridged biaryls in good yields (up to 90&#8201;% yield) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
We disclose herein an atroposelective synthesis of novel bridged biaryls containing medium&#8208;sized rings via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis. The reaction starts with addition of the carbene catalyst to the aminophenol&#8208;derived aldimine substrate. Subsequent oxidation and intramolecular desymmetrization lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;oxazepine&#8208;containing bridged biaryls in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. These novel bridged biaryl products can be readily transformed into chiral phosphite ligands. Preliminary density function theory calculations suggest that the origin of enantioselectivity arises from the more favorable frontier molecular orbital interactions in the transition state leading to the major product.

         <title>Stereoselective Chiral Molecular Carbon Imides Featuring 12&#8208;Fold [5]helicenes Around Four Cores
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular carbon imide featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores has been constructed using perylene diimide units. The structure exhibits high stereoselectivity and chirality, good solubility, and stability. Although there are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, the results verify that the obtained structure belongs to the one having the lowest energy. The enantiomers can also be separated by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase.







Abstract
Despite the great progress in research on molecular carbons containing multiple helicenes around one core, realizing the stereoselectivity of carbons containing multiple helicenes around more cores is still a great challenge. Herein, molecular carbon C204 featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores was successfully constructed by using nine perylene diimide (PDI) units, and exhibits good solubility and stability. Despite 256 possible stereoisomers caused by the 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes, we only obtained one pair of enantiomers with D3 symmetry. There are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, namely 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D. Theoretical and experimental results verify that the obtained structure belongs to 7C, which has the lowest energy. The enantiomers can also be separated by chiral HPLC. These results suggest that choosing PDIs as building blocks can not only improve the solubility and stability but also realize the stereoselectivity and chirality of molecular carbons.

         <title>Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Design through Oxide Support Modulation for Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Ethylene Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the direct metal coordination environment in single&#8208;atom catalysts, via adjustment of the oxide surface chemistry, is a powerful strategy towards reactivity modulation. An energetically facile depletion of surface oxygen on a Rh1/SnO2 catalyst unlocks an exceptional performance in the gas&#8208;phase hydroformylation of ethylene with syngas, hitherto exclusive of molecular catalysts operating in liquid environments.







Abstract
A frontier challenge in single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis is the design of fully inorganic sites capable of emulating the high reaction selectivity traditionally exclusive of organometallic counterparts in homogeneous catalysis. Modulating the direct coordination environment in SA sites, via the exploitation of the oxide support's surface chemistry, stands as a powerful albeit underexplored strategy. We report that isolated Rh atoms stabilized on oxygen&#8208;defective SnO2 uniquely unite excellent TOF with essentially full selectivity in the gas&#8208;phase hydroformylation of ethylene, inhibiting the thermodynamically favored olefin hydrogenation. Density Functional Theory calculations and surface characterization suggest that substantial depletion of the catalyst surface in lattice oxygen, energetically facile on SnO2, is key to unlock a high coordination pliability at the mononuclear Rh centers, leading to an exceptional performance which is on par with that of molecular catalysts in liquid media.

         <title>Water&#8208;soluble Self&#8208;assembled {Pd84}Ac Polyoxopalladate Nano&#8208;wheel as a Supramolecular Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest anionic polyoxopalladate ({Pd84}Ac) is shown to act as a water&#8208;soluble inorganic host encapsulating organic guests in a Russian Doll fashion. NMR analysis including 1H&#8197;NMR, Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) and Nuclear Overhauser Spectroscopy (NOESY), as well as ESI&#8208;MS, was used to study the supramolecular chemistry of this system providing conclusive evidence that {Pd84}Ac forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 host&#8208;guest complex with benzyl viologen (BV2+) in aqueous solution.







Abstract
Polyoxopalladates (POPs) are a class of self&#8208;assembling palladium&#8208;oxide clusters that span a variety of sizes, shapes and compositions. The largest of this family, {Pd84}Ac, is constructed from 14 building units of {Pd6} and lined on the inner and outer torus by 28 acetate ligands. Due to its high water solubility, large hydrophobic cavity and distinct 1H&#8197;NMR fingerprint {Pd84}Ac is an ideal molecule for exploring supramolecular behaviour with small organic molecules in aqueous media. Molecular visualisation studies highlighted potential binding sites between {Pd84}Ac and these species. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques, including 1H&#8197;NMR, 1H Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) and Nuclear Overhauser Spectroscopy (NOESY), were employed to study the supramolecular chemistry of this system. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that {Pd84}Ac forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 host&#8208;guest complex with benzyl viologen (BV2+) in aqueous solution.

         <title>Origin and Acceleration of Insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S Reduction Catalysis in Ferromagnetic Atoms&#8208;based Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental origin and acceleration of insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic element&#8208;based lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes have been disclosed in this study. We show that the increase of spin polarization degree of metal&#8208;N4 sites enhances the metal&#8208;S interaction and accelerates the Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis at cathode interface, which provides practical opportunities towards high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis to mitigate the shuttle effect has emerged as an innovative paradigm for high&#8208;efficient lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts by offering high&#8208;density active sites to realize in situ reaction with solid Li2S2. However, the profound origin of diverse single&#8208;atom species on solid&#8208;solid sulfur reduction catalysis and modulation principles remains ambiguous. Here we disclose the fundamental origin of Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements&#8208;based single&#8208;atom materials to be from their spin density and magnetic moments. The experimental and theoretical studies disclose that the Fe&#8722;N4&#8208;based cathodes exhibit the fastest deposition kinetics of Li2S (226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and the lowest thermodynamic energy barriers (0.56&#8197;eV). We believe that the accelerated Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis enabled via spin polarization of ferromagnetic atoms provides practical opportunities towards long&#8208;life batteries.

         <title>Durable High&#8208;Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Enabled by the Working&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Matching Palladium&#8208;Hydrogen Buffer Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with a Pd/C anode have excellent performance comparable to Pt/C. Pd acting as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent provides additional in situ hydrogen and absorbs infiltrated oxygen during fuel starvation to suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with Pt/C, the Pd/C anode greatly improves the durability of HT&#8208;PEMFCs during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation.







Abstract
The durability degradation during stack&#8208;operating conditions seriously deteriorates the lifetime and performance of the fuel cell. To alleviate the rapid potential rise and performance degradation, an anode design is proposed to match the working temperature of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with the release temperature of hydrogen from palladium. The result is significantly enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity of Pd and superior performance of the Pd anode. Furthermore, Pd as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent layer in the anode can provide additional in situ hydrogen and absorb infiltrated oxygen during local fuel starvation to maintain HOR and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with the traditional Pt/C anode, the Pd/C also greatly improved HT&#8208;PEMFCs durability during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation. The storage/release of hydrogen provides innovative guidance for improving the durability of PEMFCs.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangement reactions, featuring low catalyst loadings, high yields, high enantioselectivities, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and broad substrate scope has been developed. The method is efficient, delivering various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules.







Abstract
Herein we report the first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangements. These reactions, catalyzed by a chiral spiro phosphoric acid, afforded synthetically valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoketones which cannot be obtained by means of previously reported Heyns rearrangement methods. This method features low catalyst loadings, high yields and high enantioselectivities, making these reactions highly practical. We used the method to efficiently synthesize various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules. We experimentally proved that these acid&#8208;catalyzed Heyns rearrangements proceeded via a proton&#8208;transfer process involving an enol intermediate and the stereocontrol was realized during the proton&#8208;transfer step.

Functionalization of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) with ester&#8208;based side chains allows for solution processing and moderate electrical conductivity. Hydrolysis of these side chains leaves hydroxymethyl functional groups on the polymer, increases the relative amount of electroactive material, significantly increases electrical conductivity to greater than 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and changes the transport mechanism from hopping&#8208;like to metal&#8208;like.







Abstract
Herein, a route to produce highly electrically conductive doped hydroxymethyl functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films, termed PEDOT(OH) with metal&#8208;like charge transport properties using a fully solution processable precursor polymer is reported. This is achieved via an ester&#8208;functionalized PEDOT derivative [PEDOT(EHE)] that is soluble in a range of solvents with excellent film&#8208;forming ability. PEDOT(EHE) demonstrates moderate electrical conductivities of 20&#8211;60&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and hopping&#8208;like (i.e., thermally activated) transport when doped with ferric tosylate (FeTos3). Upon basic hydrolysis of PEDOT(EHE) films, the electrically insulative side chains are cleaved and washed from the polymer film, leaving a densified film of PEDOT(OH). These films, when optimally doped, reach electrical conductivities of &#8776;1200&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and demonstrate metal&#8208;like (i.e., thermally deactivated and band&#8208;like) transport properties and high stability at comparable doping levels.

         <title>A Polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;Containing Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor Enables Self&#8208;Stratification in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>

A polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing guest acceptor (EH&#8208;C8F17) enables self&#8208;stratification in the active layer of bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells. The favorable vertical phase separation and molecular stacking increases the mobility, increases carrier lifetimes, and reduces trap&#8208;assisted recombination, leading to significantly improved device performance.







Abstract
The elaborate control of the vertical phase distribution within an active layer is critical to ensuring the high performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), but is challenging. Herein, a self&#8208;stratification active layer is realised by adding a novel polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing non&#8208;fullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptor (NFSMA), EH&#8208;C8F17, as the guest into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. A favourable vertical morphology was obtained with an upper acceptor&#8208;enriched thin layer and a lower undisturbed bulk heterojunction layer. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;% was achieved, higher than the efficiency of 17.40&#8201;% for the device without EH&#8208;C8F17. Additionally, benefiting from the improved charge transport and collection realised by this self&#8208;stratification strategy, the OSC with a thickness of 350&#8197;nm had an impressive PCE of 16.89&#8201;%. The results of the study indicate that polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing NFSMA&#8208;assisted self&#8208;stratification within the active layer is effective for realising an ideal morphology for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with 4&#8208;c sql Topology for Enhanced Fluorescence Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1D&#8208;COFs were synthesized by combining vertices with different symmetries and matching the nonlinear edges. The 1D&#8208;COFs, which employed AIEgens as the vertex, showed enhanced fluorescence emission properties compared with their 2D analogs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively investigated due to their unique structure, porosity, and functionality. However, at the topological level, COFs remain as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) or three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures, while COFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) topology have not been systematically explored. In this work, we proposed a synthetic strategy for the construction of 1D&#8208;COFs based on non&#8208;linear edges and suitable high&#8208;symmetry vertices. Compared with their 2D&#8208;COFs counterparts, the 1D&#8208;COFs with AIEgens located at the vertex of the frame exhibited enhanced fluorescence. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the dimensional&#8208;induced rotation restriction (DIRR) effect could spontaneously introduce additional non&#8208;covalent interactions between the strip frames, which could substantially diminish non&#8208;radiative transitions. This work also provides protocols for the design of 1D&#8208;COFs and a guidance scheme for the synthesis of emitting COFs.

         <title>The Marriage of Sierpi&#324;ski Triangles and Platonic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful multicomponent self&#8208;assembly strategy has been developed that allows access to gorgeous 3D architectures with large cavities and high complexity. This approach has led to the synthesis of a Sierpi&#324;ski tetrahedron and a Sierpi&#324;ski octahedron with Sierpi&#324;ski triangles as the panels. These two discrete complexes, with molecular weights up to 55&#8197;kDa and diameters up to 7.4&#8197;nm, were formed in near&#8208;quantitative yields.







Abstract
Fractal structures with self&#8208;similarity are of fundamental importance in the fields of aesthetic, chemistry and mathematics. Here, by taking advantage of constructs the rational geometry&#8208;directed precursor design, we report the construction of two fascinating Platonic solids, the Sierpi&#324;ski tetrahedron ST&#8208;T and the Sierpi&#324;ski octahedron ST&#8208;O, in which each possesses a fractal Sierpi&#324;ski triangle on their independent faces. These two discrete complexes are formed in near&#8208;quantitative yield from the multi&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly of truncated Sierpi&#324;ski triangular kernel L1 with tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;based hexatopic and anthracene&#8208;based tetratopic terpyridine ligands (L3 and L4) in the presence of metal ions, respectively. The enhanced stabilities of the 3D discrete structures were investigated by gradient tandem mass spectrometry (gMS2). This work provides new constructs for the imitation of complex virus assemblies and for the molecular encapsulation of giant guest molecules.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Iron(II) Oxide Sites Directly Responsible for Preferential Carbon Monoxide Oxidation at Ambient Temperature: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a linear correlation between the amount of oxidic Fe2+ and the ambient temperature activity of Pt&#8722;FeOx preferential carbon monoxide oxidation catalysts. The hydrogen prereduction temperature and pressure determines the amount of active Fe2+ sites for alumina&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported Pt&#8722;Fe catalysts. Catalyst deactivation is linked with the oxidation of these sites.







Abstract
Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe2+ species in the working state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8722;FeOx catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady&#8208;state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe2+ sites. The active Fe2+ species are presumably Fe+2O&#8722;2 clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe3+) and metallic iron (Fe0) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe2+ is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.

&lt;p&gt;Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species in the working state-of-the-art Pt&#8722;FeO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady-state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites. The active Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species are presumably Fe&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) and metallic iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein as a Target for Metallo&#8208;Anti&#8208;Neurodegenerative Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuIII complex NAMI&#8208;A is activated by hydrolysis and then reacts with specific amino acids in the abundant brain protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein, preventing and disassembling &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, abolishing toxicity toward neuronal cells, and mitigating neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a model of Parkinson's. Since NAMI&#8208;A has a pharmaceutically&#8208;acceptable profile, it has potential for use in treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.







Abstract
The unique thermodynamic and kinetic coordination chemistry of ruthenium allows it to modulate key adverse aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) associated with Parkinson's disease. We show that the low&#8208;toxic RuIII complex trans&#8208;[ImH][RuCl4(Me2SO)(Im)] (NAMI&#8208;A) has dual inhibitory effects on both aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;syn with submicromolar affinity, and disassembles pre&#8208;formed fibrils. NAMI&#8208;A abolishes the cytotoxicity of &#945;&#8208;syn towards neuronal cells and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's. Multinuclear NMR and MS analyses show that NAMI&#8208;A binds to residues involved in protein aggregation and membrane binding. NMR studies reveal the key steps in pro&#8208;drug activation and the effect of activated NAMI&#8208;A species on protein folding. Our findings provide a new basis for designing ruthenium complexes which could mitigate &#945;&#8208;syn&#8208;induced Parkinson's pathology differently from organic agents.

         <title>Convergent Assembly of the Tricyclic Labdane Core Enables Synthesis of Diverse Forskolin&#8208;like Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labdane&#8208;type terpenes are a large family of bioactive natural products. Their often&#8208;complex structures present challenges to semisynthesis and de novo chemical synthesis in search of analogs with improved properties. To enable new modifications of the well&#8208;known tricyclic terpene forskolin, we have developed a distinct and potentially general synthetic scheme for the preparation of analogs of complex labdanes.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic strategy for the flexible preparation of forskolin&#8208;like molecules. The approach is different from the previously published works and employs a convergent assembly of the tricyclic labdane&#8208;type core from pre&#8208;functionalized cyclic building blocks. Stereoselective Michael addition enabled the fragment coupling with excellent control over three newly created contiguous stereocenters, all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers included. Silyl enol ether&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening metathesis paired with ring closure were the other key steps enabling concise assembly of the tricyclic core. Late&#8208;stage functionalization sequences transformed the tricyclic intermediates into a set of different forskolin&#8208;like molecules. The modular nature of the synthetic scheme described herein has the potential to become a general platform for the preparation of analogs of forskolin and other complex tricyclic labdanes.

         <title>In Vivo Biocatalytic Cascades Featuring an Artificial&#8208;Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report in vivo biocatalytic cascade reactions comprising a combination of canonical enzyme&#8208;catalysed reactions with an artificial&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalysed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme contains a genetically encoded unnatural catalytic residue, which catalyses the formation of a hydrazone product from biosynthetically produced benzaldehydes in E. coli.







Abstract
Artificial enzymes utilizing the genetically encoded non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) as a catalytic residue are able to react with carbonyl compounds through an iminium ion mechanism to promote reactions that have no equivalent in nature. Herein, we report an in vivo biocatalytic cascade that is augmented with such an artificial enzyme&#8208;catalysed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme in this study is a pAF&#8208;containing evolved variant of the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator, designated LmrR_V15pAF_RMH, which efficiently converts benzaldehyde derivatives produced in vivo into the corresponding hydrazone products inside E. coli cells. These in vivo biocatalytic cascades comprising an artificial&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalysed reaction are an important step towards achieving a hybrid metabolism.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Activation Enabled by a Single, Vinylogous Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes bearing only a single, vinylogous acceptor moiety is presented. The system is capable of cycloadditions through Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acid catalysis with numerous reagents: aldehydes, ketones, thioketones, nitriles, naphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols, cyclopropanes, nitrones and isobenzofurans. The mechanism was explored in detail by kinetic and mechanistic experiments.







Abstract
A novel class of highly activated donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes bearing only a single, vinylogous acceptor is presented. These strained moieties readily undergo cycloadditions with aldehydes, ketones, thioketones, nitriles, naphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols and various other substrates to yield the corresponding carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Diastereocontrol can be achieved through the choice of catalyst (Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acid). The formation of tetrahydrofurans was shown to be highly enantiospecific when chiral cyclopropanes are employed. A series of mechanistic and kinetic experiments was conducted to elucidate a plausible catalytic cycle and to rationalize the stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Cover Picture: Oxidation and Reduction Pathways in the Knowles Hydroamination via a Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles&#8217;&#160;light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination via radical processes. In their&#160;Research Article (e202211936), Yu Harabuchi, Satoshi Maeda, and co&#8208;workers investigated the energetically favorable reaction path by constructing reaction&#160;path networks and searching for the seam of crossing geometries. Calculations&#160;showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly.

Preparation and characterization of porous frameworks composed of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed multicomponent molecules has been a challenge. In their Communication (e202215836), Ichiro Hisaki et&#8197;al. demonstrate that cocrystallization of hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives yields such frameworks through a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The composition ratio in the framework was determined crystallographically.

Energy&#8208;economic separation of a wide array of toxic pollutants from water using macro&#8211;micro hierarchical pores crafted in an ionic organic framework is reported by Sujit K. Ghosh et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202214095). The uniformly distributed ordered interconnected macropores in synergy with charged viologen units demonstrated swift diffusion of analytes, thus achieving ultrafast adsorption potency toward various organic&#8211;inorganic toxic contaminants from water.

         <title>In Situ Enzyme Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y. Chen and co&#8208;workers recently expanded the range of crystalline porous solids for the in situ encapsulation of enzymes to covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The designed enzyme@COF biocatalyst exhibited high enzyme loading with minimal leaching, high catalytic activity and selectivity, chemical and long&#8208;term stability, and recyclability while also allowing a scale&#8208;up to a few grams.







Abstract
Enzyme immobilization is a widely reported method to favor the applicability of enzymes by enhancing their stability and re&#8208;usability. Among the various existing solid supports and immobilization strategies, the in situ encapsulation of enzymes within crystalline porous matrices is a powerful tool to design biohybrids with a stable and protected catalytic activity. However, to date, only a few metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been reported. Excitingly, for the first time, Y. Chen and co&#8208;workers expanded the in situ bio&#8208;encapsulation to a new class of crystalline porous materials, namely covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The enzyme@COF materials not only exhibited high enzyme loading with minimal leaching, high catalytic activity and selectivity, chemical and long&#8208;term stability and recyclability but could also be scaled up to a few grams. Undoubtedly, this work opens new striking opportunities for enzymatic immobilization and will stimulate new research on COF&#8208;based matrices.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hybrid Materials of Metal Nanoparticles and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials that consist of metal nanoparticles and polyoxometalates have enormous potential in a multitude of applications, including electrochemistry, photochemistry, catalysis, biochemistry, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This Minireview highlights recent advances in this area, covering synthesis and applications as well as highlighting current limitations and future research opportunities.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), anionic metal&#8208;oxygen nanoclusters that possess various composition&#8208;dependent properties, are widely used to modify the existing properties of metal nanoparticles and to endow them with new ones. Herein, we present an overview of recent advances in hybrid materials that consist of metal nanoparticles and POMs. Following a brief introduction on the inception of this area and its development, representative properties and applications of these materials in various fields such as electrochemistry, photochemistry, and catalysis are introduced. We discuss how the combination of two classic inorganic materials facilitates cooperative and synergistic behavior, and we also give personal perspectives on the future development of this field.

         <title>The Story of the Little Blue Box: A Tribute to Siegfried H&#252;nig</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of the chemistry associated with the little blue box has been a journey characterized by serendipity and fulfillment. We pay homage to Professor Siegfried H&#252;nig, who forged the path to the modern frontiers of viologen chemistry on which we carry out research today.







Abstract
The tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene), also known as the little blue box, constitutes a modular receptor that has facilitated the discovery of many host&#8211;guest complexes and mechanically interlocked molecules during the past 35&#8197;years. Its versatility in binding small &#960;&#8208;donors in its tetracationic state, as well as forming trisradical tricationic complexes with viologen radical cations in its doubly reduced bisradical dicationic state, renders it valuable for the construction of various stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Since the first reports in 1988, the little blue box has been featured in over 500 publications in the literature. All this research activity would not have been possible without the seminal contributions carried out by Siegfried H&#252;nig, who not only pioneered the syntheses of viologen&#8208;containing cyclophanes, but also revealed their rich redox chemistry in addition to their ability to undergo intramolecular &#960;&#8208;dimerization. This Review describes how his pioneering research led to the design and synthesis of the little blue box, and how this redox&#8208;active host evolved into the key component of molecular shuttles, switches, and machines.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Spatiotemporal Probing of Neurochemical Events by Advanced Electrochemical Sensing Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrochemical sensing has greatly increased the amount of information available on neurochemical events at all spatiotemporal dimensionalities. This Minireview highlights the latest progress on the individualized electrochemical description of vesicle properties and chemical content, single&#8208;cell monitoring of transient exocytotic release, in vivo selective amperometric sensing of neurochemical dynamics, and concurrent recording of multiple brain signals.







Abstract
Neurochemical events involving biosignals of different time and space dimensionalities constitute the complex basis of neurological functions and diseases. In view of this fact, electrochemical measurements enabling real&#8208;time quantification of neurochemicals at multiple levels of spatiotemporal resolution can provide informative clues to decode the molecular networks bridging vesicles and brains. This Minireview focuses on how scientific questions regarding the properties of single vesicles, neurotransmitter release kinetics, interstitial neurochemical dynamics, and multisignal interconnections in vivo have driven the design of electrochemical nano/microsensors, sensing interface engineering, and signal/data processing. An outlook for the future frontline in this realm will also be provided.

         <title>Photochemical Mechanisms of Fluorophores Employed in Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single molecule localization microscopy has revolutionized our ability to investigate cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. This Review discusses the photochemical mechanisms harnessed to develop small&#8208;molecule probes that exhibit photoswitching properties necessary for application in imaging methods based on single&#8208;molecule localization. Strategies to develop improved photoswitchable probes and future directions are also discussed.







Abstract
Decoding cellular processes requires visualization of the spatial distribution and dynamic interactions of biomolecules. It is therefore not surprising that innovations in imaging technologies have facilitated advances in biomedical research. The advent of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies has empowered biomedical researchers with the ability to answer long&#8208;standing questions about cellular processes at an entirely new level. Fluorescent probes greatly enhance the specificity and resolution of super&#8208;resolution imaging experiments. Here, we introduce key super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies, with a brief discussion on single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We evaluate the chemistry and photochemical mechanisms of fluorescent probes employed in SMLM. This Review provides guidance on the identification and adoption of fluorescent probes in single molecule localization microscopy to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation fluorescent probes amenable to single&#8208;molecule imaging.

A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products. The platform has been extended to enable 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;difunctionalization, which allows &#948;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;alcohol and amine derivatives to be forged in a single operation.







Abstract
A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products. The process allows E,Z&#8208;mixed dienes to be processed to a single E&#8208;alkene isomer, and leverages an inexpensive and operationally convenient I(I)/I(III) catalysis platform. The first example of catalytic 1,4&#8208;difluorination is disclosed and subsequently evolved to enable 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;difunctionalization, which allows &#948;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;alcohol and amine derivatives to be forged in a single operation. The protocol is compatible with a variety of nucleophiles including fluoride, nitriles, carboxylic acids, alcohols and even water thereby allowing highly functionalized products, with a stereocenter bearing both C(sp3)&#8722;F and C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 groups, to be generated rapidly. Scalability (up to 3&#8197;mmol), and facile post&#8208;reaction modifications are demonstrated to underscore the utility of the method in expanding organofluorine chemical space.

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Cocrystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept non&#8208;stoichiometric cocrystalline frameworks are formed using hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives with hydrogen&#8208;bonding modules, CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py. The structures and composition ratio were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Microscopic Raman spectroscopy on a single crystal showed that components are distributed gradationally and/or not homogeneously in the crystal.







Abstract
Porous frameworks composed of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed multicomponent molecules attract much attention from a functional viewpoint. However, their designed preparation and precise structural characterization remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that cocrystallization of tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives (CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py, respectively) yields non&#8208;stoichiometric mixed frameworks through networking via hydrogen bonding. The composition ratio of CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py in the framework was determined by single crystalline X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, indicating that the mixed frameworks were formed over a wide range of composition ratios. Furthermore, microscopic Raman spectroscopy on the single crystal indicates that the components are not uniformly distributed such as ideal solid solution, but are done gradationally or inhomogeneously.

         <title>Imine Directed Cp*RhIII&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8722;H Functionalization and Annulation with Amino Amides, Aldehydes, and Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent, imine directed Cp*RhIII&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H functionalization/annulation is reported. This method represents the first example of multicomponent N&#8722;H functionalization and allows for rapid access to a heterocyclic product. Further transformations and a plausible mechanism based on X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization of a catalytically competent rhodacycle intermediate are disclosed.







Abstract
A multicomponent annulation that proceeds by imine directed Cp*RhIII&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H functionalization is disclosed. The transformation affords piperazinones displaying a range of functionality and is the first example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent N&#8722;H functionalization. A broad range of readily available &#945;&#8208;amino amides, including those derived from glycine, &#945;&#8208;substituted, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids, were effective inputs and enabled the incorporation of a variety of amino acid side chains with minimal racemization. Branched and unbranched alkyl aldehydes and various stabilized diazo compounds were also efficient reactants. The piperazinone products were further modified through efficient transformations. Mechanistic studies, including X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization of a catalytically competent five&#8208;membered rhodacycle with imine and amide nitrogen chelation, provide support for the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Alkyl Formates as Transfer Hydroalkylation Reagents and Their Use in the Catalytic Conversion of Imines to Alkylamines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl formates can serve as a new class of bifunctional reagents for transfer hydroalkylation reactions. Using a ruthenium(II) catalyst combined with lithium iodide, they can promote the hydroalkylation of imines to amines, with the formation of CO2 as the only by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Easily accessible via a simple esterification of alcohols with formic acid, alkyl formates are used as a novel class of transfer hydroalkylation reagents, CO2 acting as a traceless linker. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, their reactivity in the transfer hydroalkylation of imines is investigated, using a ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst and LiI as promoter to cleave the C&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond of the formate scaffold. Providing tertiary amines, the reaction displays a divergent regioselectivity compared to previously reported transfer hydroalkylation strategies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Microfluidic Production of Ultrasmall Glyco Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a robust, fast and green synthetic route to produce ultrasmall glyco gold nanoparticles (glyco&#8208;UAuNP) by an innovative photo&#8208;induced microfluidic approach. The absence of templating and reducing agents allows a simple product purification and the recovery of the unbound thiol&#8208;ligand. We successfully built a glyco&#8208;UAuNP library, testing different combinations of linker/sugar and shaping the UAuNP glyco&#8208;ligand density.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;small gold nanoparticles (UAuNPs) are extremely interesting for applications in nanomedicine thanks to their good stability, biocompatibility, long circulation time and efficient clearance pathways. UAuNPs engineered with glycans (Glyco&#8208;UAuNPs) emerged as excellent platforms for many applications since the multiple copies of glycans can mimic the multivalent effect of glycoside clusters. Herein, we unravel a straightforward photo&#8208;induced synthesis of Glyco&#8208;UAuNPs based on a reliable and robust microfluidic approach. The synthesis occurs at room temperature avoiding the use of any further chemical reductant, templating agents or co&#8208;solvents. Exploiting 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the amount of thiol&#8208;ligand exposed on the UAuNPs is linearly correlated to the ligand concentration in the initial mixture. The results pave the way towards the development of a programmable synthetic approach, enabling an accurate design of the engineered UAuNPs or smart hybrid nano&#8208;systems.

         <title>CO2 Induces Symmetry Breaking in Layered Dipeptide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking manner of monomolecular layers in dipeptide crystals has been manipulated by utilizing CO2 to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. As a result, the dipeptide crystal symmetry was broken and the piezoelectricity greatly improved.







Abstract
Control of symmetry breaking of materials provides large opportunities to regulate their properties and functions. Herein, we report breaking the symmetry of layered dipeptide crystals by utilizing CO2 to induce the adjacent monomolecular layers to stack from the opposite to the same direction. The role of CO2 is to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. Further, the dipeptide crystals exhibit far superior piezoelectricity after symmetry breaking and the piezoelectric voltage generated from the dipeptide&#8208;based generators becomes more than 500&#8201;% higher than before. This work reveals a potential route to engineer structures and properties of layered materials and provides a deep insight into the control of non&#8208;covalent interactions.

         <title>Controlled Diels&#8211;Alder &#8220;Click&#8221; Strategy to Access Mechanically Aligned Main&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled two&#8208;stage polymerization of mechanically aligned liquid crystal networks (LCNs) has been developed that relies on a fast cyclopentadiene maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization with a latent maleimide being generated in situ upon heating. This approach allows the introduction of nucleophile&#8208; or radical&#8208;sensitive molecules into light&#8208;actuated LCNs, and the potential for larger sampler geometries.







Abstract
Aligned liquid crystal polymers are materials of interest for electronic, optic, biological and soft robotic applications. The manufacturing and processing of these materials have been widely explored with mechanical alignment establishing itself as a preferred method due to its ease of use and widespread applicability. However, the fundamental chemistry behind the required two&#8208;step polymerization for mechanical alignment has limitations in both fabrication and substrate compatibility. In this work we introduce a new protection&#8208;deprotection approach utilizing a two&#8208;stage Diels&#8211;Alder cyclopentadiene&#8208;maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization to enable mild yet efficient, fast, controlled, reproducible and user&#8208;friendly polymerizations, broadening the scope of liquid crystal systems. Thorough characterization of the films by DSC, DMA, POM and WAXD show the successful synthesis of a uniaxially aligned liquid crystal network with thermomechanical actuation abilities.

         <dc:description>
In situ quench (ISQ) reactions of functionalized chiral secondary alkyl iodides in the presence of various electrophiles using t&#8208;BuLi provided optically enriched functionalized ketones, alcohols, amides, sulfides and boronic acid esters in 86&#8211;98&#8201;% ee. Performing these reactions in continuous flow allowed an easy scale&#8208;up and reaction temperatures of up to 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
We report a practical in situ quench (ISQ) procedure involving the generation of chiral secondary alkyllithiums from secondary alkyl iodides (including functionalized iodides bearing an ester or a nitrile) in the presence of various electrophiles such as aldehydes, ketones, Weinreb amides, isocyanates, sulfides, or boronates. This ISQ&#8208;reaction allowed the preparation of a broad range of optically enriched ketones, alcohols, amides, sulfides and boronic acid esters in typically 90&#8211;98&#8201;% ee. Remarkably, these reactions were performed at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C or &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C in batch. A continuous flow set&#8208;up permitted reaction temperatures between &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 0&#8201;&#176;C and allowed a scale&#8208;up up to a 40&#8208;fold without further optimization.

         <title>Efficient Multiple Domain Ligation for Proteins Using Asparaginyl Endopeptidase by Selection of Appropriate Ligation Sites Based on Steric Hindrance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was experimentally verified in an enzymatic domain&#8208;ligation that ligation efficiency depends on ligation sites. Subsequently, a site&#8208;dependent ligation&#8208;potential index was computationally developed, considering the steric hindrance of ligation site. Referring to this index, the three&#8208;domain ligation of ER&#8208;60 succeeded. This index is applicable to identify feasible ligation sites.







Abstract
Three domain fragments of a multi&#8208;domain protein, ER&#8208;60, were ligated in two short linker regions using asparaginyl endopeptidase not involving denaturation. To identify appropriate ligation sites, by selecting several potential ligation sites with fewer mutations around two short linker regions, their ligation efficiencies and the functions of the ligated ER&#8208;60s were examined experimentally. To evaluate the dependence of ligation efficiencies on the ligation sites computationally, steric hinderances around the sites for the ligation were calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Utilizing the steric hindrance, a site&#8208;dependent ligation potential index was introduced as reproducing the experimental ligation efficiency. Referring to this index, the reconstruction of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded by the ligation of the three domains for the first time. In addition, the new ligation potential index well&#8208;worked for application to other domain ligations. Therefore, the index may serve as a more time&#8208;effective tool for multi&#8208;site ligations.

         <title>A Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Molecular Cage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Enzymatic Photocyclization of Alkynylaniline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocyclization of alkynylanilines catalyzed by an aggregated PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage has been shown to mimic bio&#8208;enzyme catalysis by aggregated biological macromolecules. The aggregated supramolecular species exhibits a higher photocatalytic efficiency than dispersed metal&#8208;organic cages without aggregation.







Abstract
Enzymes facilitate chemical conversions through the collective activity of aggregated components, but the marriage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with molecular containers to emulate enzymatic conversion remains challenging. Herein, we report a new approach to construct a PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage with AIE characteristics for the photocyclization of alkynylaniline by restricting the rotation of the pendant phenyl rings peripheral to the PtII corner. With the presence of water, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions involving the triphenylphosphine fragments resulted in aggregation of the molecular cages into spherical particles and significantly enhanced the PtII&#8208;based luminescence. The kinetically inert Pt&#8208;NP chelator, with highly differentiated redox potentials in the ground and excited states, and the efficient coordination activation of the platinum corner facilitated excellent catalysis of the photocyclization of alkynylaniline. The enzymatic kinetics and the advantages of binding and activating substrates in an aqueous medium provide a new avenue to develop mimics for efficient photosynthesis.

         <title>Formyl Radical Generation from &#945;&#8208;Chloro N&#8208;Methoxyphthalimides Enables Selective Aldehyde Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro N&#8208;methoxyphthalimides is reported, enabling selective aldehyde synthesis by alkene hydroformylation under mild photoredox conditions. Experimental and computational approaches establish the concerted hydrochloride elimination for the formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro methoxy radicals.







Abstract
The aldehydes installation by radical formylation constitutes an attractive synthetic strategy. However, the generation of formyl radicals for organic synthesis applications remains unknown. Herein we report the first formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro N&#8208;methoxyphthalimides, which selectively synthesize aldehydes by alkene hydroformylation under mild photoredox conditions. The aldehydes can be installed on acrylates, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl ketones, and complex steroids by radical hydroformylation in excellent chemoselectivity and regioselectivity. The concerted hydrochloride elimination for the formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro methoxy radicals is established by experimental and computational approaches.

         <title>Tailored Tolane&#8208;Perfluorotolane Assembly as Supramolecular Base Pair Replacement in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar &#960;&#8208;interactions and preferential stacking were observed by attaching tolane and perfluorotolanes as nucleobase surrogates to acyclic backbone replacements in an otherwise unmodified DNA duplex. The butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) was identified as privileged scaffold for exploiting the supramolecular arene&#8208;fluoroarene recognition in DNA.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions offer outstanding possibilities for engineering of supramolecular systems, including nucleic acids. Here, we implement the tolane&#8208;perfluorotolane interaction as base pair replacement in DNA. Tolane (THH) and perfluorotolane (TFF) moieties were connected to acyclic backbone units, comprising glycol nucleic acid (GNA) or butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) building blocks, that were incorporated via phosphoramidite chemistry at opposite positions in a DNA duplex. Thermodynamic analyses by UV thermal melting revealed a compelling stabilization by THH/TFF heteropairs only when connected to the BuNA backbone, but not with the shorter GNA linker. Detailed NMR studies confirmed the preference of the BuNA backbone for enhanced polar &#960;&#8208;stacking. This work defines how orthogonal supramolecular interactions can be tailored by small constitutional changes in the DNA backbone, and it inspires future studies of arene&#8208;fluoroarene&#8208;programmed assembly of DNA.

         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives are key components of the molecules of life. A hydrative amination of ynamides/thioalkynes under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions has been developed. This practical strategy offers a new and convenient avenue for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives using readily available sulfinamides as nitrogen sources. Computational studies suggest that the reaction is enabled by a new type of sulfonium [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement.

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation Using Inter&#8208;Facet Edge Rich WO3 Arrays for Photoelectrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct 1&#8201;e&#8722; electron and indirect 2&#8201;e&#8722; electron transfer pathways for photoelectrochemical water oxidation are achieved using an inter&#8208;facet edge (IEF) rich WO3 photoanode in the presence of CO32&#8722;. The total Faraday efficiencies of H2O2 and OH&#8901; products exceed 90&#8201;%. Then, selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by in situ using the formed OH&#8901; delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of &#8776;768&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
Water oxidation reaction leaves room to be improved in the development of various solar fuel productions, because of the kinetically sluggish 4&#8208;electron transfer process of oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, we realize reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2O2 and OH&#8901;, formations by water oxidation with total Faraday efficiencies of more than 90&#8201;% by using inter&#8208;facet edge (IFE) rich WO3 arrays in an electrolyte containing CO32&#8722;. Our results demonstrate that the IFE favors the adsorption of CO32&#8722; while reducing the adsorption energy of OH&#8901;, as well as suppresses surface hole accumulation by direct 1&#8208;electron and indirect 2&#8208;electron transfer pathways. Finally, we present selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by in situ using the formed OH&#8901;, which delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of &#8776;768&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% selectivity. This work offers a promising approach to tune or control the oxidation reaction in an aqueous solar fuel system towards high efficiency and value&#8208;added product.

         <title>Perfectly Encoding &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Anions in the RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE=Y, Yb, Lu) Family with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Balanced Birefringence</title>

Improving the arrangement of the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (C3N3O3)3&#8722; anions in the RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE=Y, Yb, Lu) series leads to strong second harmonic generation responses, short UV cutoffs, and moderate birefringence. This finding opens an avenue for designing target materials with balanced linear and nonlinear optical properties which have potential for practical laser applications.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal, which simultaneously exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and desired optical anisotropy, is a core optical material accessible to the modern optoelectronics. Accompanied by strong SHG effect in a NLO crystal, a contradictory problem of overlarge birefringence is ignored, leading to low frequency doubling efficiency and poor beam quality. Herein, a series of rare earth cyanurates RE5(C3N3O3)(OH)12 (RE=Y, Yb, Lu) were successfully characterized by 3D electron diffraction technique. Based on a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy, they enable the simultaneous fulfillment of strong SHG responses (2.5&#8211;4.2&#215; KH2PO4), short UV cutoff (ca. 220&#8197;nm) and applicable birefringence (ca. 0.15 at 800&#8197;nm) by the introduction of rare earth coordination control of &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C3N3O3)3&#8722; anions. These findings provide high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wavelength NLO materials and highlight the exploration of cyanurates as a new research area.

Based on a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy, they enable the simultaneous fulfillment of strong SHG responses (2.5&#8211;4.2&#215; KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), short UV cutoff (ca. 220&#8197;nm) and applicable birefringence (ca. 0.15 at 800&#8197;nm) by the introduction of rare earth coordination control of &#960;-conjugated (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. These findings provide high-performance short-wavelength NLO materials and highlight the exploration of cyanurates as a new research area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

CPA&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;trifluoroacetamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds affords highly functionalized 1&#8208;trifluoroacetamido cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene derivatives 3 in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. An asymmetric three&#8208;component reaction of 1, 2 and ortho&#8208;hydroxybenzhydryl alcohols 4 provides the densely functionalized hexahydroxanthenes with concurrent creation of five contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
We report herein the first examples of chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions between 2&#8208;trifluoroacetamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes 1 and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds 2. Polysubstituted 1&#8208;acetamido cyclohexenes 3 were formed in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise process as shown by deuterium labelling experiments. A catalytic enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of 1, 2 and ortho&#8208;hydroxybenzhydryl alcohols 4 was subsequently developed furnishing the densely functionalized hexahydroxanthenes 5 in a highly stereoselective manner. This multicomponent reaction generates four chemical bonds with concurrent creation of five contiguous stereocenters.

         <title>Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Anthrone&#8208;based Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By a simple stereoselective condensation with remote chirality control, axial chirality could be introduced to the symmetric anthrone backbones that comprise mostly sp2&#8208;hybridized carbons. The generated oxime ether functionality enables their transformation with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion via Beckmann rearrangement into enantioenriched dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Anthrones and analogues are structural cores shared by diverse pharmacologically active natural and synthetic compounds. The sp2&#8208;rich nature imposes inherent obstruction to introduce stereogenic element onto the tricyclic aromatic backbone. In our pursuit to expand the chemical space of axial chirality, a novel type of axially chiral anthrone&#8208;derived skeleton was discovered. This work establishes oxime ether as suitable functionality to furnish axial chirality on symmetric anthrone skeletons through stereoselective condensation of the carbonyl entity with long&#8208;range chirality control. The enantioenriched anthrones could be elaborated into dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing well&#8208;defined stereogenic center via Beckmann rearrangement with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion.

         <title>Anionic Magnesium and Calcium Hydrides: Transforming CO into Unsaturated Disilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO has directly been transformed into small organic starting materials using earth&#8208;abundant, anionic group 2 hydride reagents.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterisation and reactivity of two isostructural anionic magnesium and calcium complexes is reported. By X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction techniques, the anionic hydrides are shown to exist as dimers, held together by a range of interactions between the two anions and two bridging potassium cations. Unlike the vast proportion of previously reported dimeric group 2 hydrides, which have hydrides that bridge two group 2 centres, here the hydrides are shown to be &#8220;terminal&#8221;, but stabilised by interactions with the potassium cations. Both anionic hydrides were found to insert and couple CO under mild reaction conditions to give the corresponding group 2 cis&#8208;ethenediolate complexes. These cis&#8208;ethenediolate complexes were found to undergo salt elimination reactions with silyl chlorides, allowing access to small unsaturated disilyl ethers with a high percentage of their mass originating from the C1 source CO.

         <dc:description>
The reaction of tryptamine with &#945;&#8208;ketoesters in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and 4&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid afforded the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and ee values. A concise seven&#8208;step asymmetric total synthesis of alstratine A, a cagelike hexacyclic indole alkaloid, was developed featuring this enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report herein an asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. In the presence of a catalytic amount of simple alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, reaction of tryptamines with methyl 2&#8208;oxoalkanoates afforded the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and ee values. A primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE=4.5) using C2&#8208;deteurium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that rearomatization through deprotonation of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion could be the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. A concise enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstratine A, a hexacyclic cagelike monoterpene indole alkaloid, featuring this reaction as a key step, was subsequently accomplished. Remeasurement of the [a]D value of the natural product indicates that natural alstratine A is dextrorotatory rather than levorotatory as it was initially reported in the isolation paper.

         <title>Large&#8208;area Free&#8208;standing Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Films by Liquid&#8208;air Interfacial Polymerization for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>

A series of free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area metalloporphyrin&#8208;based COF films, connected through dynamic covalent acylhydrazone bonds, are synthesized by liquid&#8208;air interfacial polymerization. These films are smooth, dense, uniform, and defect free, and display high hydrolytic and mechanical stability. The Co&#8208;based films are active for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and show promising applications in flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Synthesizing large&#8208;area free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) films is of vital importance for their applications but is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported the synthesis of large metalloporphyrin&#8208;based COF films and their applications for oxygen electrocatalysis. The reaction of meso&#8208;benzohydrazide&#8208;substituted metal porphyrins with tris&#8208;aldehyde linkers afforded free&#8208;standing COF films at the liquid&#8208;air interface. These films can be scaled up to 3000&#8197;cm2 area and display great mechanical stability and structural integrity. Importantly, the Co&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based films are efficient for electrocatalytic O2 reduction and evolution reactions. A flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled using the films and showed high performance with a charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.88&#8197;V at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high stability under bent conditions (0&#176; to 180&#176;). This work thus presents a strategy to synthesize functionalized COF films with high quality for uses in flexible electronics.

         <title>Imaging Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Detachment of Mass&#8208;Selected Chiral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;resolved Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is demonstrated in the photoelectron spectroscopy of mass&#8208;selected deprotonated 1&#8208;indanol anionic ([Ind&#8208;H]&#8722;) enantiomers. A unique PECD signature is observed for several isomers and detachment channels of [Ind&#8208;H]&#8722;. This work supports the use of anions for future analytical methods of enantiomeric discrimination, and allows for insight into the influence of short&#8208;range interactions on PECD.







Abstract
Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is a forward&#8208;backward asymmetry in the photoemission from a non&#8208;racemic sample induced by circularly polarized light. PECD spectroscopy has potential analytical advantages for chiral discrimination over other chiroptical methods due to its increased sensitivity to the chiral potential of the molecule. The use of anions for PECD spectroscopy allows for mass&#8208;selectivity and provides a path to simple experimental schemes that employ table&#8208;top light sources. Evidence of PECD for anions is limited, and insight into the forces that govern PECD electron dynamics in photodetachment is absent. Here, we demonstrate a PECD effect in the photodetachment of mass&#8208;selected deprotonated 1&#8208;indanol anions. By utilizing velocity map imaging photoelectron spectroscopy with a tunable light source, we determine the energy&#8208;resolved PECD over a wide range of photon energies. The observed PECD reaches up to 11&#8201;%, similar to what has been measured for neutral species.

         <title>Nitrenoid from Oxime: A Practical Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocenyl Phenanthridines via Nitrene&#8208;Involved Ring&#8208;Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Grignard reagent&#8208;mediated synthesis of ferrocene&#8208;based phenanthridines from oximes was developed. The tertiary magnesium&#8208;zinc nitrenoid was proposed as the key intermediate, which underwent ring&#8208;expansion/rearrangement to form the pyridine skeleton.







Abstract
Nitrenes and nitrenoids are highly reactive species and the proposed key intermediates in nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compound synthesis. In this work, we developed a practical method for the synthesis of phenanthridines by the reaction of oximes and Grignard reagents (with or without diethylzinc) via ring&#8208;expansion of magnesium coordinated nitrenoid complex as the key step. The method has been used to synthesize optically active planar chiral ferrocenyl phenanthridines.

         <dc:description>
Necklace&#8208;like nanohoops with an embedded carborane have been synthesized. The nanohoops functionalized by nido&#8208;o&#8208;carborane show excellent fluorescence emission properties, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90&#8201;% and a high solid&#8208;state quantum efficiency (87.3&#8201;%), which offer applications in OLEDs and bioimaging.







Abstract
The combination of carbon&#8208;based nanohoops with other functional organic molecular structures should lead to the design of new molecular configurations with interesting properties. Here, necklace&#8208;like nanohoops embedded with carborane were synthesized for the first time. The unique deboronization of o&#8208;carborane has led to the facile preparation of ionic nanohoop compounds. Nanohoops functionalized by nido&#8208;o&#8208;carborane show excellent fluorescence emission, with a solution quantum yield of up to 90.0&#8201;% in THF and a solid&#8208;state quantum efficiency of 87.3&#8201;%, which opens an avenue for the applications of the nanohoops in OLEDs and bioimaging.

A palladium/PC&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction of amino&#8208;tethered 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene with aryl and alkenyl halides was developed. This method delivered various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated.







Abstract
Chiral perhydroindoles are found in a number of natural products and biologically active compounds. Therefore, the development of new asymmetric methodology for rapid access to this core is of high importance. Herein, we reported a highly regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selective palladium/PC&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions of readily available amino tethered 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes with aryl and alkenyl halides, delivering various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with high enantioselectivity. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated. DFT computation results indicate that the difference in &#916;Edis of two migration insertion transition states determines the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Reversible Switching CuII/CuI Single Sites Catalyze High&#8208;rate and Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>

In this work, reversible redox&#8208;switching CuII/CuI single sites confined in Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets were used in the CO2 photoreduction to CO.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a model of reversible redox&#8208;switching metal&#8211;organic framework single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets, where the abundant metal single sites benefit for highly selective CO2 reduction, while the reversible redox&#8208;switching metal sites can effectively activate CO2 molecules. Taking the synthetic Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra unravel the reversible switching CuII/CuI single sites initially accept photoexcited electrons and then donate them to CO2 molecules, which favors the rate&#8208;liming activation into CO2&#948;&#8722;, verified by in situ FTIR spectra and Gibbs free energy calculations. As an outcome, Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets achieve near 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CO with a high rate of 860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without any sacrifice reagent or photosensitizer, where both the activity and selectivity outperform previously reported photocatalysts evaluated under similar conditions.

         <title>Antiaromatic Sapphyrin Isomer: Transformation into Contracted Porphyrinoids with Variable Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer was successfully synthesized based on the unique cyclization at a terminal N&#8208;confused pyrrole unit of pentapyrrane. The specific reactivity associated with the antiaromaticity and confused pyrrole provides chances for constructing novel porphyrinoids with tunable aromaticity.







Abstract
Sapphyrin is a pentapyrrolic expanded porphyrin with a 22&#960; aromatic character. Herein, we report the synthesis of a 20&#960; antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer 1 by oxidative cyclization of a pentapyrrane precursor P5 with a terminal &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole. The resulting isomer 1, containing a mis&#8208;linked bipyrrole unit in the skeleton, exhibits a reactivity for further oxidation due to the distinct antiaromatic electronic structure, affording a fused macrocycle 2, possessing a spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing [5.6.5.6]&#8208;tetracyclic structure. Subsequent treatment with an acid afforded a weakly aromatic pyrrolone&#8208;appended N&#8208;confused corrole 3, and thermal fusion gave a [5.6.5.7]&#8208;tetracyclic&#8208;ring&#8208;embedded 14&#960; aromatic triphyrin(2.1.1) analog 4. The cyclization at the mis&#8208;linked pyrrole moiety of P5 played a crucial role in synthesizing the antiaromatic porphyrinoid susceptible to facile transformation to novel porphyrinoids with variable aromaticity.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation and Engineering of Sesterviolene Synthase from Streptomyces violens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sesterviolene synthase from Streptomyces violarus is the second bacterial sesterterpene synthase to be described. The enzyme generates one main and several side products whose mechanisms of formation were studied in isotopic labelling experiments and through DFT calculations. Enzyme engineering allowed isolation and structural characterisation of the side products and gave access to the main product in sufficient quantity to study its chemistry.







Abstract
The sesterviolene synthase from Streptomyces violens was identified and represents the second known sesterterpene synthase from bacteria. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed that provided detailed insight into its complex cyclisation mechanism. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to a high&#8208;yielding enzyme variant that provided six additional minor products and the main product in sufficient quantities to study its chemistry.

         <title>Catalytic Ammonia Oxidation to Dinitrogen by a Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel complex for catalytic oxidation of NH3 to N2 is demonstrated using the radicals 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxyl (tBu3ArO&#8901;) or 2,2,6,6&#8208;(tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) as the H&#8208;atom acceptor to cleave the N&#8722;H bond of a NH3 ligand. Two Ni&#8722;NH2 fragments form an N&#8722;N bond in a bridging Ni&#8208;hydrazine product. Ni&#8208;mediated hydrazine disproportionation affords N2 and NH3 in the proposed catalytic cycle. (BDFE=Bond Dissociation Free Energy)







Abstract
We report a nickel complex for catalytic oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen under ambient conditions. Using the aryloxyl radical 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxyl (tBu3ArO&#8901;) as a H atom acceptor to cleave the N&#8722;H bond of a coordinated NH3 ligand up to 56&#8197;equiv of N2 per Ni center can be generated. Employing the N&#8208;oxyl radical 2,2,6,6&#8208;(tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO&#8901;) as the H&#8208;atom acceptor, up to 15&#8197;equiv of N2 per Ni center are formed. A bridging Ni&#8208;hydrazine product identified by isotopic nitrogen (15N) studies and supported by computational models indicates the N&#8722;N bond forming step occurs by bimetallic homocoupling of two paramagnetic [Ni]&#8722;NH2 fragments. Ni&#8208;mediated hydrazine disproportionation to N2 and NH3 completes the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop phonon&#8208;engineered, lanthanide&#8208;doped upconverting nanoparticles with the lowest phonon energies available to date. Low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X=Cl, Br) upconverting nanoparticles exhibit dramatically suppressed multiphonon relaxation, enhancing upconversion emission from higher lanthanide excited states and enabling the first room&#8208;temperature observation of avalanche&#8208;like upconversion by Nd3+ ions.







Abstract
Optical applications of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size&#8208;controlled synthesis of low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X=Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128&#8197;cm&#8722;1. KPb2Cl5 nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb2X5 nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche&#8208;like emission from KPb2Cl5&#8201;:&#8201;Nd3+ nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra&#8208;low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon&#8208;dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.

     alt="Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide-doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We develop phonon-engineered, lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles with the lowest phonon energies available to date. Low-phonon-energy KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl, Br) upconverting nanoparticles exhibit dramatically suppressed multiphonon relaxation, enhancing upconversion emission from higher lanthanide excited states and enabling the first room-temperature observation of avalanche-like upconversion by Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical applications of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size-controlled synthesis of low-phonon-energy KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche-like emission from KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra-low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon-dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Destruction and Assembly: Switching between Two Differently Composed Cage&#8208;Type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon irradiation, metal complexes rise like a phoenix from the ashes. In a mixture of two different photoswitchable ligands (red and blue) and Co2+ ions, a Co2L3 structure forms from only the blue ligands. Upon irradiation with violet light, both ligands isomerize and the blue Co2L3 disassembles. Now the red ligand forms the red Co2L3 structure. Irradiation with green light destroys this complex and the first re&#8208;assembles. The process is fully reversible.







Abstract
We report on two regioisomeric, diazocine ligands 1 and 2 that can both be photoswitched between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;configurations with violet and green light. The self&#8208;assembly of the four species (1&#8208;Z, 1&#8208;E, 2&#8208;Z, 2&#8208;E) with CoII ions was investigated upon changing the coordination vectors as a function of the ligand configuration (E vs Z) and regioisomer (1 vs 2). With 1&#8208;Z, Co2(1&#8208;Z)3 was self&#8208;assembled, while a mixture of ill&#8208;defined species (oligomers) was observed with 2&#8208;Z. Upon photoswitching with 385&#8197;nm to the E configurations, the opposite was observed with 1&#8208;E forming oligomers and 2&#8208;E forming Co2(2&#8208;E)3. Light&#8208;controlled dis/assembly was demonstrated in a ligand competition experiment with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of CoII ions; alternating irradiation with violet and green light resulted in the reversible transformation between Co2(1&#8208;Z)3 and Co2(2&#8208;E)3 over multiple cycles without significant fatigue by photoswitching.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Ib&#225;&#241;ez group, Institute of Science and Technology Austria. They recently published an article together with the Brutchey group from USA, and Arbiol group from Spain. The work presents the strategy of functionalizing surfactant&#8208;free particles by using inorganic molecules to control the microstructure during the sintering process. In particular, bismuth thiolates were used to functionalize surfactant&#8208;free SnTe particle surfaces. Upon thermal processing, decomposition of bismuth thiolates renders SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites with synergistic functions to enhance thermoelectric performance. &#8220;Surface Functionalization of Surfactant&#8208;Free Particles: A Strategy to Tailor the Properties of Nanocomposites for Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance&#8221;, C.

         <title>A Biocompatible Probe for the Detection of Neutrophil Elastase Free from the Interference of Structural Changes and Its Application to Ratiometric Photoacoustic Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutrophil elastase (NE) plays a key role in chronic inflammation and acute responses to infection and injury. Effective diseases interventions thus call for precise identification of NE to aid clinical application of such diseases. However, the detection process suffers from this interference of structural changes of NE. Herein, we introduce a molecular probe with high biocompatibility to overcome the interference, which was achieved by combining theoretical calculation and experimental that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of NE in cells and in vivo. The upregulated NE accumulation was specifically measured in inflammation by ratiometric photoacoustic and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, and providing a new method for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Intramolecular Singlet Fission and Exciton Transport in Linear Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We newly synthesized a series of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc&#8208;homo&#8208;oligomers [(Tc)n :&#160;n&#160;= 2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)n &#160;and Tc&#8208;hetero&#8208;oligomer [TcF3&#8208;(Tc)4&#8208;TcF3] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF3 units. Finally, we successfully observed high&#8208;yield exciton trapping process (trapped triplet yield:&#160;&#934;TrT&#160;= 176%).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Level Modulation of Anthraquinone&#8208;containing Resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde Resin Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production with Exceeding 1.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to modulate the photogenerated charge behavior is a promising and challenging strategy for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Here, we introduce electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) into the framework of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin, which modulates the donor/acceptor ratio from the perspective of molecular design for promoting the charge separation. Interestingly, H2O2 can be produced via oxygen reduction and water oxidation pathways, verified by isotopic labeling and in situ characterization techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that DHAQ can reduce the energy barrier for H2O2 production. RF&#8208;DHAQ exhibits excellent overall photosynthesis of H2O2 with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency exceeding 1.2%. This work opens a new avenue to design polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level for high&#8208;efficiency artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with atomic precision structures are promising candidates construct functional nanomaterials via self&#8208;assembly. Non&#8208;covalent interactions at molecular levels can govern the self&#8208;assembly of POM clusters, for which the precise control of POM&#8208;based assemblies can be realized at single&#8208;cluster levels. This mini&#8208;review focuses on the synthesis and properties of POM&#8208;based nanostructures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies and co&#8208;assemblies of POM clusters and other subnanometer building blocks. Several synthetic strategies have been developed for rational control of POM&#8208;based assemblies in terms of morphologies, compositions and properties. 1D subnanometer POM assemblies demonstrate remarkable enhanced mechanical properties due to the topological interactions between nanowires and surroundings. The in&#8208;depth understanding of POM&#8208;based assemblies may help in the design of functional nanomaterials in fundamental perspectives and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Arbitrarily&#8208;Regulated Monomer Sequence in Multi&#8208;Block Copolymers Synthesis by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid access to sequence&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;block copolymers (multi&#8208;BCPs) remains as a challenging task in the polymer synthesis. Here we employ a Lewis pair (LP) composed of organophosphorus superbase and bulky organoaluminum to effectively copolymerize the mixture of methacrylate, cyclic acrylate, and two acrylates, into well&#8208;defined di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and even a hepta&#8208;BCP in one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step manner. The combined livingness, dual&#8208;initiation and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enable us to achieve not only a trihexaconta&#8208;BCP with the highest record in 8 steps by using four&#8208;component monomer mixture as building blocks, but also the arbitrarily&#8208;regulated monomer sequence in multi&#8208;BCP, simply by chaing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures, thus demonstrating the powerful capability of our strategy in improving the efficiency and enriching the composition of multi&#8208;BCP synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triply Negatively Charged Nanographene Bilayer with Spin Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is resurgent interest in atomically precise nanographene radical ions composed of fused hexagons. Two monoradical anions can readily form a doubly negatively charged &#960;&#8208;dimer, but to our knowledge, no triply negatively charged &#960;&#8208;dimer species have been isolated till now. Herein we report the largest open&#8208;shell grapheneic bilayer and also the first example of triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Upon three&#8208;electron reduction, bilayer nanographene fragment molecule (C96H24Ar6)2 (Ar = 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#160; (12) was transformed to a triply negatively charged species 123&#8226;&#8211;, which has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. 123&#8226;&#8211; features a 96&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (96c/3e) pancake bond with a doublet ground state, which can be thermally excited to a quartet state. It is the largest open&#8208;shell nanographene bilayer species till now constructed with 34 &#960;&#8208;fused rings with 96 conjugated sp2 carbon atoms. Spin frustration is observed with the frustration parameter f = |&#952;cw|/TN &gt; 31.8 at low temperatures in 123&#8226;&#8211;, which indicates graphene upon reduction doping may behave as quantum spin liquids.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral separation membranes have shown great potential for efficient separation of racemic mixtures into enantiopure components for many applications such as in food and pharmaceutical industries; however, scalable fabrication of membranes with both high enantioselectivity and flux remains a challenge. Herein, enantiopure  S  &#8208;poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (  S  &#8208;PdMeOx) macromonomers were synthesized and used to prepare a new type of enantioselective membrane consisting of a chiral  S  &#8208;PdMeOx network scaffolded by graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The  S  &#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane showed near&#8208;quantitative enantiomeric excess (  ee  ) (98.3 &#177; 1.7%) of  S  &#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;limonene over  R  &#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene and a flux of 0.32 mmol m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  . This work demonstrates the potential of homochiral poly(2,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)s in chiral discrimination and provides a new route to the development of highly efficient enantioselective membranes using synthetic homochiral polymer networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of the Active Sites on Metallic MoO2&#8722;x Nano&#8208;Sea&#8208;Urchin for Atmospheric CO2 Photoreduction Under UV, Visible, and Near&#8208;Infrared Light Illumination</title>

         <dc:description>
Metallic vacancy&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin shows excellent light absorption property covering from UV to NIR light and exhibits greatly enhanced selective photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on a dual active site (Mo&#8722;Vo&#8722;Mo).







Abstract
We report an oxygen vacancy (Vo)&#8208;rich metallic MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin with partially occupied band, which exhibits super CO2 (even directly from the air) photoreduction performance under UV, visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin displays a CH4 evolution rate of 12.2 and 5.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under full spectrum and NIR light illumination in concentrated CO2, which is ca. 7&#8208; and 10&#8208;fold higher than the Vo&#8208;poor MoO2&#8722;x, respectively. More interestingly, the as&#8208;developed Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin can even reduce CO2 directly from the air with a CO evolution rate of 6.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under NIR light illumination. Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy in MoO2&#8722;x can facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation to generate *COOH as well as the subsequent protonation of *CO towards the formation of CH4 because of the formation of a highly stable Mo&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosides by Silver&#8208;Assisted Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8208;assisted gold catalysis was applied to alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors for the synthesis of purine, pyrimidine, quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, and asparagine glycosides. It was demonstrated (40 examples) to be highly versatile for the synthesis of important types of N&#8208;glycosides. The method has been utilized for the synthesis of various 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and the disaccharide dipeptide moiety of chloroviruses.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides from stable glycosyl donors in a catalytic fashion is still challenging, though they exist ubiquitously in DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and other biological molecules. Herein, silver&#8208;assisted gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors is shown to be a versatile approach for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, asparagine glycosides and quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one N&#8208;glycosides. Thus synthesized nucleosides were subjected to the oxidation&#8211;reduction sequence for the conversion of Ribf&#8208; into Araf&#8208; nucleosides, giving access to nucleosides that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, the protocol is demonstrated to be suitable for the synthesis of 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides in a facile manner. Direct attachment of an asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptide to the glucopyranose and subsequent extrapolation to afford the dipeptide disaccharide unit of chloroviruses is yet another facet of this endeavor.

         <title>A Telomerase&#8208;Assisted Strategy for Regeneration of DNA Nanomachines in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a smart DNA nanomachine that can perform regeneration operations via telomerase (TE)&#8208;aided track extension in living cells. By customizing apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) as the responsive module of the nanomachine, multiply augmented imaging of APE1 at the single&#8208;cell level could be implemented. By arranging the regenerative module, the nanomachine could provide the expression diversity of TE in different cell lines.







Abstract
DNA nanomachines have been engineered into diverse personalized devices for diagnostic imaging of biomarkers; however, the regeneration of DNA nanomachines in living cells remains challenging. Here, we report an ingenious DNA nanomachine that can implement telomerase (TE)&#8208;activated regeneration in living cells. Upon apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;responsive initiation of the nanomachine, the walker of the nanomachine moves along tracks regenerated by TE, generating multiply amplified signals through which APE1 can be imaged in situ. Additionally, augmentation of the signal due to the regeneration of the nanomachines could reveal differential expression of TE in different cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the use of biomarkers to assist in the regeneration of nanomachines in living cells. This study offers a new paradigm for the development of more applicable and efficient DNA nanomachines.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Towards Harnessing their Full Power with Darwinian Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking cues from Darwinian evolution, is it possible to apply molecular evolution to drug&#8208;like molecules? This Review covers technologies for the synthesis of DNA&#8208;encoded libraries enabling translation of the DNA code into synthetic products, explores the different selection format, and discusses how these can be brought together to evolve synthetic molecules with Darwinian selection pressure.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technologies are transforming the drug discovery process, enabling the identification of ligands at unprecedented speed and scale. DEL makes use of libraries that are orders of magnitude larger than traditional high&#8208;throughput screens. While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8211;phenotype connection that is exploitable for molecular evolution, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable barcode but does not allow &#8220;translation&#8221; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this Review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8220;translation&#8221; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.

         <title>Schlenk's Legacy&#8212;Methyllithium Put under Close Scrutiny</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide contaminations of commercial methyllithium solutions (MeLi&#8208;c) can be simply removed by the use of K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent and solvent&#8208;dependent precipitation. 7Li&#8208;NMR spectroscopy is an efficient tool for quantifying the halide contaminations, which can effect solid&#8208;state structures as shown for monomeric [(Me3TACN)LiCH3].







Abstract
Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well&#8208;implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are inherently contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the isolation of chloride&#8208;free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the 7Li&#8208;NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride&#8208;free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me3TACN)LiCH3], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide&#8208;contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me3TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.

&lt;p&gt;Halide contaminations of commercial methyllithium solutions (MeLi-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;) can be simply removed by the use of K[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] as a halide-trapping reagent and solvent-dependent precipitation. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li-NMR spectroscopy is an efficient tool for quantifying the halide contaminations, which can effect solid-state structures as shown for monomeric [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TACN)LiCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;].

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well-implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are inherently contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the isolation of chloride-free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] as a halide-trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li-NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride-free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TACN)LiCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide-contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Morphology Optimization of the Photoactive Layer through Crystallinity and Miscibility Regulation for High&#8208;performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design principle of the third component is established to tackle the issue of excessive self&#8208;aggregation of Y6&#8208;derivatives during the film formation through crystallinity and miscibility regulation. With the addition of BTP&#8208;Th, the ternary device yielded a remarkable efficiency of 18.53&#8201;%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control reference binary device.







Abstract
On the premise of strongly crystalline materials involved, it is a challenge to control the phase separation of bulk&#8208;heterojunction donor/acceptor active layer to fabricate high&#8208;performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we develop a molecular design strategy of the third component to synthesize three guest materials (namely BTPT, BTP&#8208;Th, and BTP&#8208;2Th) to address this issue. We investigate and reveal the effect of crystallinity and miscibility of the third component in controlling the phase separation of Y6&#8208;derivatives&#8208;based blend film. As a result, a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% is obtained in the ternary PSC based on PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6 with BTP&#8208;Th as the third component, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control binary device. Our study offers a molecular design strategy to develop a third component for building ternary PSCs in terms of crystallinity and miscibility regulation.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 Cathode Catalysts for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties have been synthesized, and the ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell not only presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but also a long&#8208;term durability with more than 100&#8197;h operations in H2&#8208;O2 system. Density functional calculation further reveals that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve practical application of fuel cell, it is vital to develop highly efficient and durable Pt&#8208;free catalysts. Herein, we prepare atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties and abundant mesoporous structure. The ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63 and 0.83&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free), and also exhibits long&#8208;term stability with more than 120 and 100&#8197;h for H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free) and H2&#8208;O2, respectively. Density functional calculations further unveil that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst, while the Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moiety is inactive for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which successfully explain the puzzle why most Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;organic framework &#8208;derived ZnNC catalysts in previous reports did not present good ORR activity because of their Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moieties. This work offers a new route for speeding up development of AEMFCs.

         <title>MOFs with Open Metal(III) Sites for the Environmental Capture of Polar Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric metal(III) carboxylate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) exhibit a preferential adsorption of polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over water through a direct binding of the VOC vapor on the open metal sites, paving the way for their utilization in indoor air quality control.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMS) interact strongly with a range of polar gases/vapors. However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL&#8208;100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single&#8208;component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Nanoconfinement Effect on Nanoreactor via Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence microscopy based on Ru@MSN realizes direct observation of nanoconfinement during electrochemical process which can bridges mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications. Long time decay and recover ability caused by nanoarchitecture are resolved. The nanoconfinement effects are stable even in complex biological conditions, offering excellent route for single biomolecule imaging.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular&#8208;level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.

We report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in poly(amino acid)s mediated by an exogenous ligand and metal ions. The polypeptides show controllable transitions between &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix conformations as well as a conformation&#8208;driven vesicular expanding and shrinking phenomenon. Moreover, the metallopolymers self&#8208;assemble into ferritin&#8208;inspired nanovehicles for efficient brain delivery and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging in vivo.







Abstract
Metal ions play critical roles in facilitating peptide folding and inducing conformational transitions, thereby impacting on the biological activity of many proteins. However, the effect of metal sites on the hierarchical structures of biopolymers is still poorly understood. Herein, inspired by metalloproteins, we report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in synthetic polymers mediated by a variety of metal ions. The copolymers are decorated with clinically available desferrioxamine (DFO) as an exogenous ligand template, which presents a geometric constraint toward peptide backbone via short&#8208;range hydrogen bonding interactions, thus dramatically altering the secondary conformations and self&#8208;assembly behaviors of polypeptides and allowing for a controllable &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition modulated by metal&#8211;ligand interactions. These metallopolymers could form ferritin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structures with high stability and membrane activity for efficient brain delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;We report an order-to-order conformational regulation in poly(amino acid)s mediated by an exogenous ligand and metal ions. The polypeptides show controllable transitions between &#946;-sheet and &#945;-helix conformations as well as a conformation-driven vesicular expanding and shrinking phenomenon. Moreover, the metallopolymers self-assemble into ferritin-inspired nanovehicles for efficient brain delivery and long-lasting magnetic resonance imaging in vivo.

         <title>Electronic Perturbation of Copper Single&#8208;Atom CO2 Reduction Catalysts in a Molecular Way</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atoms is achieved on graphdiyne derivates with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H, &#8722;OMe), rendering distinctive Cu&#948;+ valance and electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity. In situ spectroscopical and theoretical studies reveal that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the &#8722;F group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward a high CH4 production.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) plays a crucial role in harnessing their catalytic activities, yet challenges remain at a molecular scale in a controlled fashion. By tailoring the structure of graphdiyne (GDY) with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups, we show herein the electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atom CO2 reduction catalysts in a molecular way. The elaborately introduced functional groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H and &#8722;OMe) can regulate the valance state of Cu&#948;+, which is found to be directly scaled with the selectivity of the electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. An optimum CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% was achieved over the Cu SAC on the F&#8208;substituted GDY. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the electron&#8208;withdrawing group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward the CH4 production. Our strategy paves the way for precise electronic perturbation of SACs toward efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Biodegradable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene&#8208;like Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While it resembles high density polyethylene with regard to its mechanical properties and solid&#8208;state structure and has a high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C), the novel polyester&#8208;2,18 material at the same time fully hydrolyzes in in vitro enzymatic degradation studies and mineralizes under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) within two months.







Abstract
We report a novel polyester material generated from readily available biobased 1,18&#8208;octadecanedicarboxylic acid and ethylene glycol possesses a polyethylene&#8208;like solid&#8208;state structure and also tensile properties similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Despite its crystallinity, high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C) and hydrophobic nature, polyester&#8208;2,18 is subject to rapid and complete hydrolytic degradation in in vitro assays with isolated naturally occurring enzymes. Under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) the material is biodegraded with mineralization above 95&#8201;% within two months. Reference studies with polyester&#8208;18,18 (Tm=99&#8201;&#176;C) reveal a strong impact of the nature of the diol repeating unit on degradation rates, possibly related to the density of ester groups in the amorphous phase. Depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

         <title>Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Electron&#8208;Spin Qubit in a Chromophore/Stable&#8208;Radical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach to molecular qubits employs a photoexcited chromophore covalently linked to a deuterated stable radical (C&#8722;R&#8901;). Photoexcitation of the C within C&#8722;R&#8901; results in ultrafast intersystem crossing to produce the spin&#8208;polarized quartet state (Q) that decays to the spin&#8208;polarized ground state (D0). Both Q and D0 have narrow linewidths that allow facile addressability using microwave pulses.







Abstract
Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to stable radicals can serve as qubit and/or qudit candidates for quantum information applications. 1,6,7,12&#8208;Tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy)&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4&#8201;:&#8201;9,10&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) linked to a partially deuterated &#945;,&#947;&#8208;bisdiphenylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylallyl radical (BDPA&#8208;d16) was synthesized and characterized by time&#8208;resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Photoexcitation of tpPDI&#8208;BDPA&#8208;d16 results in ultrafast radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing to produce a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin&#8208;polarized doublet ground state (D0). Pulse&#8208;EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of Tm=2.1&#177;0.1&#8197;&#956;s and 2.8&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;s for Q and D0, respectively. BDPA&#8208;d16 eliminates the dominant 1H hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Novel Plasticizers by Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Di&#8208; or Multi&#8208;carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first di&#8208; and multi&#8208;carbonylations of olefins with di&#8208; or polyols provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of di&#8208; or multiesters with high efficiency and selectivity. Representative diesters show potential performance (Tg) as novel plasticizers.







Abstract
Diesters are of fundamental importance in the chemical industry and are used for many applications, e.g. as plasticizers, surfactants, emulsifiers, and lubricants. Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient method for the selective synthesis of diesters via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct carbonylation of di&#8208; or polyols with readily available alkenes. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success is the use of a specific palladium catalyst with the &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand L16 providing esterification of all alcohols and a high n/iso ratio. The synthesized diesters were evaluated as potential plasticizers in PVC films by measuring the glass transition temperature (Tg) via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

The synthesized diesters were evaluated as potential plasticizers in PVC films by measuring the glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Coupling of Chiral Frenkel Exciton for Intense, Bisignate Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly coupled chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08, measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregate bundles. The bisignate, highly correlated dissymmetry factors in absorption gabs and in emission glum reveal a small Davydov splitting of the excited states and the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission.







Abstract
We show that chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circularly polarized luminescence with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08. This outstanding value is measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregates that form twisted bundles. Our measurements, obtained by a Mueller polarization analysis, are artifact&#8208;free and reveal a quasi&#8208;perfect correlation between the dissymmetry factors in absorption, gabs, and in emission glum. We interpret the bisignate dissymmetry factors as the signature of a strong coupling between chiral Frenkel excitons longitudinally excited along the bundles. We further resolve by polarimetry analysis the split in energy between the excited states with a Davydov splitting as small as 28&#8197;meV. We finally show the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission bands with opposite optical chirality. These mirror&#8208;imaged emissive chiroptical features emerge from the structural rigidity of the bundles that preserves the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>ZnF2&#8208;Riched Inorganic/Organic Hybrid SEI: in situ&#8208;Chemical Construction and Performance&#8208;Improving Mechanism for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Multifunctional FEC is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to produce a ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. The hydrolysate of FEC can favorably regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to restrict the H2O&#8208;related parasitic reactions. The in situ formed ZHS layer not only realize uniform Zn deposition, but also suppresses ZMA corrosion.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrites growth and serious parasitic reactions in aqueous electrolytes, greatly hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery. On the basis of in situ&#8208;chemical construction and performance&#8208;improving mechanism, multifunctional fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to construct a high&#8208;quality and ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. Notably, FEC additive can regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to reduce H2O molecules reactivity. Additionally, the ZHS layer with strong Zn2+ affinity can avoid dendrites formation and hinder the direct contact between the electrolyte and anode. Therefore, the dendrites growth, Zn corrosion, and H2 evolution reaction on ZMA in FEC&#8208;included ZnSO4 electrolyte are highly suppressed. Thus, ZMA in such electrolyte realize a long cycle life over 1000&#8197;h and deliver a stable coulombic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles.

         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing and catalysis. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202212459), Petra&#8197;S. Dittrich et&#8197;al. demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles.

         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;13 radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate, as reported by Thomas Theis, Eduard&#8197;Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215678). Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a 1.4 T NMR spectrometer equipped with a standard radio&#8208;frequency detection coil for over 3 minutes. RASER detection enables new detection schemes for 13&#8197;C&#8208;hyperpolarized contrast agents and particular new opportunities for next&#8208;generation molecular imaging on clinical MRI scanners.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Fluorofluorophores for Multicolor In Vivo Imaging
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorofluorophores (fluoro refers to fluorine and fluorescence) are chemical tools to study perfluorocarbons. To understand the biodistribution of perfluorocarbons in animals, fluorofluorophores that emit past 1000&#8197;nm are necessary. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and application of shortwave infrared (SWIR)&#8208;emissive fluorofluorophores towards understanding how to control the pharmacokinetics of perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions in mammals.







Abstract
Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence imaging&#8211; to visualize nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and SWIR fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR&#8208;emissive, fluorous&#8208;soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red&#8208;shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8212;to date. After characterizing the dyes, their utility was demonstrated by tracking perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion biodistribution in vivo. Using an excitation&#8208;multiplexed approach to image two variables simultaneously, we gained insight into the importance of size and surfactant identity on biodistribution.

         <title>Overall Carbon&#8208;neutral Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Molten Salts using a Liquid Metal Sn Cathode</title>

         <dc:description>
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts is established by using liquid metal Sn cathode due to enhanced CO2 conversion and excellent energy&#8208;storage capability of Sn@C.







Abstract
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral CO2 electroreduction requires enhanced conversion efficiency and intensified functionality of CO2&#8208;derived products to balance the carbon footprint from CO2 electroreduction against fixed CO2. A liquid Sn cathode is herein introduced into electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts to fabricate core&#8211;shell Sn&#8722;C spheres (Sn@C). An in situ generated Li2SnO3/C directs a self&#8208;template formation of Sn@C. Benefitting from the accelerated reaction kinetics from the liquid Sn cathode and the core&#8211;shell structure of Sn@C, a CO2&#8208;fixation current efficiency higher than 84&#8201;% and a high reversible lithium&#8208;storage capacity of Sn@C are achieved. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by other low melting point metals, such as Zn and Bi. This process integrates energy&#8208;efficient CO2 conversion and template&#8208;free fabrication of value&#8208;added metal&#8208;carbon, achieving an overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6+2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes has been developed, forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable Z&#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds.







Abstract
An efficient double allene protocol for the formation of benzazocines has been developed. The reaction constitutes a highly regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6+2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable Z&#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds.

         <title>Co&#8208;Dissolved Isostructural Polyoxovanadates to Construct Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersing nanosized [PtV9O28]7&#8722; clusters into a [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution, the so&#8208;called co&#8208;dissolved strategy, ensures double separations resulting in the construction of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The SAC with Pt/O synergism can efficiently boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
We explored a co&#8208;dissolved strategy to embed mono&#8208;dispersed Pt center into V2O5 support via dissolving [PtV9O28]7&#8722; into [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution. The uniform dispersion of [PtV9O28]7&#8722; in [V10O28]6&#8722; solution allows [PtV9O28]7&#8722; to be surrounded by [V10O28]6&#8722; clusters via a freeze&#8208;drying process. The V centers in both [PtV9O28]7&#8722; and [V10O28]6&#8722; were converted into V2O5 via a calcination process to stabilize Pt center. These double separations can effectively prevent the Pt center agglomeration during the high&#8208;temperature conversion process, and achieve 100&#8201;% utilization of Pt in [PtV9O28]7&#8722;. The resulting Pt&#8208;V2O5 single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a CH4 yield of 247.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 25&#8197;times higher than that of Pt nanoparticle on the V2O5 support, which was accompanied by the lactic acid photooxidation to form pyruvic acid. Systematical investigations on this unambiguous structure demonstrate an important role of Pt&#8722;O atomic pair synergy for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Rational Positioning of Metal Ions to Stabilize Open Tin Sites in Beta Zeolite for Catalytic Conversion of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal ions such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ were positioned within Sn&#8208;Beta zeolite to form adjacent bimetallic catalytically active sites with stable open Sn sites. The Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst selectively converts glucose to methyl lactate and methyl vinyl glycolate in methanol in high yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Via hydrothermal synthesis of Sn&#8208;Al gels, mild dealumination and ion exchange, a bimetallic Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst was prepared which can convert glucose to methyl lactate (MLA) and methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) in methanol at yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively. Results from solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, spectroscopic analysis, probe&#8208;temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, and density functional theory calculations conclusively reveal that the openness of the Sn sites, such as by the formation of [(SiO)3&#8722;Sn&#8722;OH] entities, is governed by an adjacent metal cation such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. This relies on the low structure&#8208;defective pore channel, provided by the current synthesis scheme, and the specific silica hydroxyl anchor point is associated with the incorporation of Sn for additional and precise metal ion localization. The presence of metal cations significantly improved the catalytic performance of Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta for glucose isomerization and conversion to MLA of sugar compared with Sn&#8208;Beta.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing Passivation Layer via Surface Chelation for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface treatment of inorganic perovskite film by trifluoroacetamidine featuring chelation configuration and multi&#8208;fluorine atoms allows record power conversion efficiency of inorganic perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Minimizing surface defect is vital to further improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed a passivator trifluoroacetamidine (TFA) to suppress CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx film defects. The amidine group of TFA can strongly chelate onto the perovskite surface to suppress the iodide vacancy, strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds. Moreover, three fluorine atoms allow strong intermolecular connection via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus constructing a robust shield against moisture. The TFA&#8208;treated PSCs exhibit remarkably suppressed recombination, yielding the record PCEs of 21.35&#8201;% and 17.21&#8201;% for 0.09&#8197;cm2 and 1.0&#8197;cm2 device areas, both of which are the highest for all&#8208;inorganic PSCs so far. The device also achieves a PCE of 39.78&#8201;% under indoor illumination, the highest for all&#8208;inorganic indoor photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, TFA greatly improves device ambient stability by preserving 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 960&#8197;h.

&lt;p&gt;Minimizing surface defect is vital to further improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed a passivator trifluoroacetamidine (TFA) to suppress CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; film defects. The amidine group of TFA can strongly chelate onto the perovskite surface to suppress the iodide vacancy, strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds. Moreover, three fluorine atoms allow strong intermolecular connection via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus constructing a robust shield against moisture. The TFA-treated PSCs exhibit remarkably suppressed recombination, yielding the record PCEs of 21.35&#8201;% and 17.21&#8201;% for 0.09&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device areas, both of which are the highest for all-inorganic PSCs so far. The device also achieves a PCE of 39.78&#8201;% under indoor illumination, the highest for all-inorganic indoor photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, TFA greatly improves device ambient stability by preserving 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 960&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenane&#8208;based catalysts that can be activated &#8216;on&#8208;demand&#8217; through the controlled breakdown of the mechanical bond have been developed. Encapsulation of the CuI ion within the cavity formed by the two interlocked macrocycles inhibits its ability to catalyze the CuAAC reaction. However, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture by the opening of the macrocycles restores the capacity of the copper catalyst to form triazoles.







Abstract
Rotaxanes and molecular knots exhibit particular properties resulting from the presence of a mechanical bond within their structure that maintains the molecular components interlocked in a permanent manner. On the other hand, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture through the breakdown of the mechanical bond can activate properties which are masked in the parent compound. Herein, we present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenanes as OFF/ON catalysts for the copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The encapsulation of the CuI ion inside the [2]catenanes inhibits its ability to catalyze the formation of triazoles. In contrast, the controlled opening of the two macrocycles induces the breaking of the mechanical bond, thereby restoring the catalytic activity of the CuI ion for the CuAAC reaction. Such OFF/ON catalysts can be involved in signal amplification processes with various potential applications.

         <title>sn&#8208;1 Specificity of Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase&#8208;1 Revealed by a Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isomer&#8208;resolving mass spectrometry assay reveals that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) has an sn&#8208;1 specificity when catalyzing the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The specific link between PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 and the activity of LPCAT1 enables visualization of the boundaries between cancerous and normal regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue via desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).







Abstract
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) plays a critical role in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in cellular lipidome. However, evidence is scarce regarding its sn&#8208;selectivity, viz. the preference of assembling acyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;A (CoA) at the C1 or C2&#8208;hydroxyl on a glycerol backbone because of difficulty to quantify the thus&#8208;formed PC sn&#8208;isomers. We have established a multiplexed assay to measure both sn&#8208; and acyl&#8208;chain selectivity of LPCAT1 toward a mixture of acyl&#8208;CoAs by integrating isomer&#8208;resolving tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal that LPCAT1 shows exclusive sn&#8208;1 specificity regardless of the identity of acyl&#8208;CoAs. We further confirm that elevated PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 relative to its sn&#8208;isomer results from an increased expression of LPCAT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. MS imaging via desorption electrospray ionization of PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 thus enables visualization of HCC margins in human liver tissue at a molecular level.

Encapsulation makes the difference! A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane ligand with metal confining properties is key in the stabilization of heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214638), Nicola Armaroli, B&#233;atrice Delavaux&#8208;Nicot, Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten and Dominique Armspach show how encapsulation of the metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand moiety in the cyclodextrin cavity influences their electronic properties. In particular, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is largely prevented thus resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.

         <title>Mechanisms and Synthetic Strategies in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven [2+2]&#8208;Heterocycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of four membered heterocycles usually requires multi&#8208;step procedures and prefunctionalized reactants. A straightforward alternative is the photochemical [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between an alkene and a carbonyl derivative, conventionally based on the photoexcitation of this latter. However, this approach is limited by the absorption profile of the carbonyl, requiring in most of the cases the use of high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;light, that often results in undesired side reactions and/or the degradation of the reaction components. The development of new and milder visible light&#8208;driven [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions is, therefore, highly desirable. In this Review, we highlight the most relevant achievements in the development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions promoted by visible light, with a particular emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms. The open challenges will also be discussed, suggesting new possible evolution, and stimulating new methodological developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Formal Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds of Diboronates by N&#8208;Trisylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bisborylalkanes play important roles in organic synthesis as versatile bifunctional reagents. The two boron moieties in these compounds can be selectively converted into other functional groups through cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation or radical reactions. Thus, the development of efficient methods for synthesizing bisborylalkanes is highly demanded. Herein we report a new strategy to access bisborylalkanes through the reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with diboronate, in which the bis(boryl) methane is transformed into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via formal carbene insertion. Since the N&#8208;trisylhydrazones can be readily derived from the corresponding aldehydes, this strategy represents a practical synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diboronates with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies reveal an unusual neighboring group effect of 1,1&#8208;bis(boronates), which accounts for the observed regioselectivity when unsymmetric 1,1&#8208;diboronates are applied.</dc:description>

         <title>A Visible Light Driven Nickel Carbonylation Catalyst: The Synthesis of Acid Chlorides from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe here the development of a visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst. The combination of the large bite&#8208;angle Xantphos ligand with nickel(0) generates a catalyst capable of activating alkyl halides toward carbonylation at ambient temperature in the presence of blue light irradiation, and the reductive elimination of high energy acid chloride products. Unlike classical carbonylations, where the coordination of carbon monoxide inhibits the reactivity of earth abundant nickel catalysts, a CO&#8208;associated nickel is found to be the active catalyst in the reaction. Coupling the build&#8208;up of acid chlorides with nucleophile addition can be used to access various amides, esters and thioesters, including those of sterically encumbered substrates or with metal&#8208;reactive functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Containing Dual O2 Reduction Centers for Overall Photosynthetic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly desirable for achieving high&#8208;efficiency overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via molecular design. However, precise construction of COFs toward overall photosynthetic H2O2 remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the crystalline s&#8208;heptazine&#8208;based COFs (HEP&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF and HEP&#8208;TAPB&#8208;COF) with separated redox centers for efficient H2O2 production from O2 and pure water. The spatially and orderly separated active sites in HEP&#8208;COFs can efficiently promote charge separation and enhance photocatalytic H2O2 production. Compared with HEP&#8208;TAPB&#8208;COF, HEP&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF exhibits higher H2O2 production efficiency for integrating dual O2 reduction active centers of s&#8208;heptazine and triazine moieties. Accordingly, HEP&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF bearing dual O2 reduction centers exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.65% with a high apparent quantum efficiency of 15.35% at 420 nm, surpassing previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding and Reactivity in Terminal versus Bridging Arenide Complexes of Thorium Acting as Th(II) Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thorium redox chemistry is extremely scarce due to the high stability of Th(IV). Here we report two unique examples of thorium arenide complexes prepared by reduction of a Th(IV)&#8208;siloxide complex in presence of naphthalene, the mononuclear arenide complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th(&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (1) and the inverse&#8208;sandwich complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (2). The electrons stored in these complexes allow the reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, AdN3, CO2, HBBN). Higher reactivity was found for the complex 1 which reacts with the diazoolefin IDipp=CN2 to yield the unexpected Th(IV) amidoalkynyl complex 5via a terminal N&#8208;heterocyclic vinylidene intermediate. This work showed that arenides can act as convenient redox&#8208;active ligands for implementing thorium&#8208;ligand cooperative multielectron transfer and that the reactivity can be tuned by the arenide binding mode.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Synthetic Route to High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Oxide Nanoparticles and Their Enhanced Solar Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main limitations of current methods for synthesizing perovskite oxide (ABO3) nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., the high reagent costs and sophisticated equipment, the long time and high&#8208;temperature processing, or multiple post&#8208;processing and thermal treatment steps, hamper their full study and potential application. Here, we use a facile low temperature (50&#176;C) chemical bath synthesis and only one annealing step to successfully produce high phase purity and crystalline quality nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 NPs (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M= Fe, Mn, Al). We also show the versatility of this approach by fabricating La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 solid solution and non&#8208;RE&#8208;based BiFeO3 perovskite. To assess the potential of the as&#8208;prepared REFeO3 and REMnO3 NPs, they are used for photocatalytic degradation of the norfloxacin antibiotic and show high efficiency. We believe this easy, robust, versatile, and general route for synthesizing ABO3&#8208;based NPs can be further explored in the vast perovskite family and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Subsurface Engineering Induced Fermi Level De&#8208;pinning in Metal Oxide Semiconductors for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for renewable solar light conversion. However, surface Fermi level pinning (FLP), caused by surface trap states, severely restricts the PEC activities. Theoretical calculations indicate subsurface oxygen vacancy (sub&#8208;Ov) could release the FLP and retain the active structure. A series of metal oxide semiconductors with sub&#8208;Ov were prepared through precisely regulated spin&#8208;coating and calcination. Etching X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron energy loss spectra (EELS) demonstrated Ov located at sub ~2&#8208;5 nm region. Mott&#8208;Schottky and open circuit photovoltage results confirmed the surface trap states elimination and Fermi level de&#8208;pinning. Thus, superior PEC performances of 5.1, 3.4, and 2.1 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE were achieved on BiVO4, Bi2O3, TiO2 with outstanding stability for 72 h, outperforming most reported works under the identical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals as Bioinspired Hair&#8208;Like Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the typical haptic elements are natural hairy structures that animals and plants rely on for feedback. Although these hair sensors are an admirable inspiration, the development of active flow sensing components having low elastic moduli and high aspect ratios remains a challenge. Here, we report a new sensing approach based on a flexible thin and optically transmissive organic crystal of high aspect ratio, which is stamped with fluorescent dye for tracking. When subjected to gas flow and exposed to laser, the crystal bends due to exerted pressure and acts as optical flow sensor with low detection limit (~1.578 m&#160;s&#8210;1) and fast response time (~2.70 s).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the typical haptic elements are natural hairy structures that animals and plants rely on for feedback. Although these hair sensors are an admirable inspiration, the development of active flow sensing components having low elastic moduli and high aspect ratios remains a challenge. Here, we report a new sensing approach based on a flexible thin and optically transmissive organic crystal of high aspect ratio, which is stamped with fluorescent dye for tracking. When subjected to gas flow and exposed to laser, the crystal bends due to exerted pressure and acts as optical flow sensor with low detection limit (~1.578 m&#160;s&#8210;1) and fast response time (~2.70 s). The air-flow-induced crystal deformation and flow dynamics response are modelled by finite element analysis. Due to the simple design, light-weight, and mechanical robustness, this prototypical crystal hair-like sensor opens prospects for a new class of sensing devices from wearable electronics to aeronautics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approaching Dianionic Tetraoxadiborecine Macrocycles: 10&#8208;Membered Bora&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating Borafluorenate Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dianionic tetraoxadiborecines are isolated via the reaction between 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion and non&#8208;benzenoid quinones. Remarkably, the bora&#8208;crown ether ring is able to capture a sodium ion from sodium tetrakis[3.5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate. Additionally, the position and/or binding of the metal ions to the bora&#8208;crown are easily observable via specific color changes.







Abstract
The addition of non&#8208;benzenoid quinones, acenapthenequinone or aceanthrenequinone, to the 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion (1) affords the first examples of dianionic 10&#8208;membered bora&#8208;crown ethers (2&#8211;5), which are characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 11B), X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These tetraoxadiborecines have distinct absorption profiles based on the positioning of the alkali metal cations. When compound 4, which has a vacant C4B2O4 cavity, is reacted with sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, a color change from purple to orange serves as a visual indicator of metal binding to the central ring, whereby the Na+ ion coordinates to four oxygen atoms. A detailed theoretical analysis of the calculated reaction energetics is provided to gain insight into the reaction mechanism for the formation of 2&#8211;5. These data, and the electronic structures of proposed intermediates, indicate that the reaction proceeds via a boron enolate intermediate.

         <title>Uncovering Aging Chemistry of Perovskite Precursor Solutions and Anti&#8208;aging Mechanism of Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aging of precursor solutions is the major stumbling block for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time we used the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to molecularly explore the perovskite precursor solution chemistry. We identified that the methylammonium and formamidinium cations and the I&#8208; anion are the motivators of the aging chemistry. Further, we introduced two kinds of Lewis bases, triethyl phosphate (TP) and ethyl ethanesulfonate (EE), as new additives in the solution and unraveled that both of them can protect the reactive cations from aging through weak interactions. Significantly, TP is superior to EE in enhancing long&#8208;term solution stability as it can well&#8208;maintain the internal interaction structures within the solution phase. The PSC derived from a fresh TP&#8208;doped solution delivered a high power conversion efficiency of 23.06%, 92.23% of which remained in that from a 21&#8208;day&#8208;old solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Mass Spectrometry Imaging Enables High Definition for Mapping Lipids in Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids in biological tissues is useful for correlating molecular distribution with pathological results, which could provide useful information for both biological research and disease diagnosis. It is well understood that the lipidome could not be clearly deciphered without tandem mass spectrometry analysis, but this is challenging to achieve in MSI due to the limitation in sample amount at each image spot. Here we develop a multiplexed MS2 imaging (MS2I) method that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot, providing spatial structural lipidomic information. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, imaging of 20 phospholipid C=C location isomers is also realized, showing enhanced molecular images with high definition in structure for mouse brain and human liver cancer tissue sections. Spatially mapped t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding has also been adopted to visualize the tumor margin with enhancement by structural lipidomic information.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds have been used as building blocks for numerous organic semiconductors over the past few decades. While the success is based on thiophene&#8208;containing compounds, aromatic compounds that contain thiepine, a sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring arene, has been less well investigated.

         <title>Single Atom Ring Contraction of Peptide Macrocycles Using Cornforth Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The notion of late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective chemistry to modify chemical structures is of growing interest and utility. Here, we perform a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in macrocyclic backbones using the Cornforth rearrangement. This chemistry could be used to rapidly access unique chemical space which would be difficult to achieve using a standard building block approach.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective transformations of densely functionalized scaffolds have been a topic of intense interest in chemical synthesis. Herein we have repurposed the rarely used Cornforth rearrangement as a tool to effect a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in cyclic peptide backbones. Investigations into the kinetics of the rearrangement were carried out to understand the impact of electronic factors, ring size, and linker type on the reaction efficiency. Conformational analysis was undertaken and showed how subtle differences in the peptide backbone result in substrate&#8208;dependent reaction profiles. This methodology can now be used to perform conformation&#8208;activity studies. The chemistry also offers an opportunity to install building blocks that are not compatible with traditional C&#8208;to&#8208;N iterative synthesis of macrocycle precursors.

         <title>C&#8722;H Fluoromethoxylation of Arenes by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of [N&#8722;OCH2F] redox&#8208;active reagents were synthetized via electrodecarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O coupling of N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles with fluoroacetic acid and subsequent alkylation. By irradiation with blue LEDs in the presence of a photosensitizer, these bench stable reagents allow the synthesis of monofluoromethyl aryl ethers via functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active N&#8208;(fluoromethoxy)benzotriazoles were made accessible from fluoroacetic acid and hydroxybenzotriazoles via electrodecarboxylative coupling. After alkylation, they become effective monofluoromethoxylation reagents, enabling the photocatalytic C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes. Thus, irradiation of 1&#8208;(OCH2F)&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;6&#8208;(CF3)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers. This method allows the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant structures without relying on ecologically problematic halofluorocarbons.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of [N&#8722;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F] redox-active reagents were synthetized via electrodecarboxylative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;O coupling of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxybenzotriazoles with fluoroacetic acid and subsequent alkylation. By irradiation with blue LEDs in the presence of a photosensitizer, these bench stable reagents allow the synthesis of monofluoromethyl aryl ethers via functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox-active &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(fluoromethoxy)benzotriazoles were made accessible from fluoroacetic acid and hydroxybenzotriazoles via electrodecarboxylative coupling. After alkylation, they become effective monofluoromethoxylation reagents, enabling the photocatalytic C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes. Thus, irradiation of 1-(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F)-3-Me-6-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers. This method allows the late-stage functionalization of biologically relevant structures without relying on ecologically problematic halofluorocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru3(CO)12&#8208;Catalyzed Modular Assembly of Hemilabile Ligands by C&#8722;H Activation of Phosphines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation of monodentate phosphines has been developed for modular assembly of bidentate hemilabile ligands. The use of mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid (MPAA) ligands is crucial for the inhibition of catalyst poisoning.







Abstract
Hemilabile ligands have been applied extensively in transition metal catalysis, but preparations of these molecules typically require multistep synthesis. Here, modular assembly of diverse phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, including related axially chiral compounds, is first reported through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of phosphines with isocyanate directed by phosphorus(III) atoms. High reactivity and regioselectivity can be obtained by using a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst with a mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid ligand. This transformation significantly expands the pool of phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, some of which have shown excellent efficiency for asymmetric catalysis. More broadly, the discovery constitutes a proof of principle for facile construction of hemilabile ligands directly from the parent monodentate phosphines by C&#8722;H activation with ideal atom, step and redox economy. Several dinuclear ruthenium complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

         <title>Boosting the Activity of Pd Single Atoms by Tuning Their Local Environment on Ceria for Methane Combustion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For Pd/ceria single atom catalysts, a thermal treatment to the ceria support prior to Pd deposition induces the formation of Pd&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) single sites that are highly active for CH4 oxidation.







Abstract
Supported Pd single atom catalysts (SACs) have triggered great research interest in methane combustion yet with contradicting views on their activity and stability. Here, we show that the Pd SAs can take different electronic structure and atomic geometry on ceria support, resulting in different catalytic properties. By a simple thermal pretreatment to ceria prior to Pd deposition, a unique anchoring site is created. The Pd SA, taking this site, can be activated to Pd&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) that has greatly enhanced activity for methane oxidation: T50 lowered by up to 130&#8201;&#176;C and almost 10 times higher turnover frequency compared to the untreated catalyst. The enhanced activity of Pd&#948;+ site is related to its oxygen&#8208;deficient local structure and elongated interacting distance with ceria, leading to enhanced capability in delivering reactive oxygen species and decomposing reaction intermediates. This work provides insights into designing highly efficient Pd SACs for oxidation reactions.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched 2nd Order Non&#8208;Linear Optical Response in an Arylimido&#8208;Polyoxometalate with High Contrast and Cyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer transitions in a new arylimido&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) are turned off by reduction, enabling a high contrast (94&#8201;%) electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) response. The overall combination of on/off contrast, high visible transparency and multicycle stability is leading in switchable 2nd order NLO chromophores, and shows for the first time the strong potential of POM hybrids as redox&#8208;driven optical switches.







Abstract
Electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical responses have been demonstrated for the first time in polyoxometalates (POMs), with an arylimido&#8208;derivative showing a leading combination of high on/off contrast (94&#8201;%), high visible transparency, and cyclability. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical and TD&#8208;DFT studies indicate that the switch&#8208;off results from weakened charge transfer (CT) character of the electronic transitions in the reduced state. This represents the first study of an imido&#8208;POM reduced state, and demonstrates the potential of POM hybrids as electrochemically activated molecular switches.

         <title>A Photoenzymatic Strategy for Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereoselective Hydroalkylation with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds has been developed. By this method, a series of &#947;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds were synthesized in high yields and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Carbene insertion reactions initiated with diazo compounds have been widely used to develop unnatural enzymatic reactions. However, alternative functionalization of diazo compounds in enzymatic processes has been unexploited. Herein, we describe a photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds. This method generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals through an ene reductase catalyzed photoinduced electron transfer process from diazo compounds, enabling the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbonyl compounds in good yields and stereoselectivities. This study further expands the possible reaction patterns in photo&#8208;biocatalysis and offers a new approach to solving the selectivity challenges of radical&#8208;mediated reactions.

         <title>How Crystal Symmetry Dictates Non&#8208;Local Vibrational Circular Dichroism in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) is intimately linked to crystal symmetry and therefore has the capability to distinguish between polymorphic forms. In this article, we classify the non&#8208;local terms due to crystal chirality versus the local terms due to molecular chirality. We find that already an achiral screw axis leads to significant changes in the VCD spectrum that are intrinsic to the crystal structure.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) can be used to determine the absolute structure of chiral crystals, but its interpretation remains a challenge in modern spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate the effect of a twofold screw axis on the solid&#8208;state VCD spectrum in a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of P21 crystals of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;indanol. Even though the space group is achiral, a single proper symmetry operation has an important impact on the VCD spectrum, which reflects the supramolecular chirality of the crystal. Distinguishing between contributions originating from molecular chirality and from chiral crystal packing, we find that while IR absorption hardly depends on the symmetry of the space group, the situation is different for VCD, where completely new non&#8208;local patterns emerge. Understanding the two underlying mechanisms, namely gauge transport and direct coupling, will help to use VCD to distinguish polymorphic forms.

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Robust Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Cancer with Enhanced Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (M@O&#8208;A) nanoparticles for synergetic cancer chemotherapy, PDT, and immune checkpoint blockade with reduced immunotoxicity are reported. M@O&#8208;A selectively targets and blocks the highly PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing tumor cells and decomposes under laser irradiation to release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxaliplatin (OXA), eliciting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and therefore an enhanced immunotherapy and simultaneously attenuated irAEs.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade has become a paradigm&#8208;shifting treatment modality to combat cancer, while conventional administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), often shows unsatisfactory immune responses and lead to severe immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs). Herein, we develop a PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which consists of oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle core and a dense shell of aptPD&#8208;L1 (denoted as M@O&#8208;A). Upon light irradiation, this nanosystem enables concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and enhanced immunotherapy in one shot to inhibit both primary colorectal tumors and untreated distant tumors in mice. Notably, M@O&#8208;A shows scarcely any systemic immunotoxicity in a clinical irAEs&#8208;mimic transgenic mouse model. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy for priming robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer with enhanced safety.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Tellurium&#8208;Based Chalcogen Bonding: Photocontrolled Anion Binding and Anion Abstraction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding receptor has been constructed in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The receptor shows photocontrolled halide anion binding and acts as a photocontrolled organocatalyst for chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted halide anion abstraction in a Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction.







Abstract
Exploring new noncovalent bonding motifs with reversibly tunable binding affinity is of fundamental importance in manipulating the properties and functions of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly systems and materials. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a unique visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazole/triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding (ChB) system in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The binding strengths between these azo&#8208;derived ChB receptors and the halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) could be reversibly regulated upon irradiation by visible light of different wavelengths. The cis&#8208;bidentate ChB receptors exhibit enhanced halide anion binding ability compared to the trans&#8208;monodentate receptors. In particular, the telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based ChB receptor can achieve both high and significantly photoswitchable binding affinities for halide anions, which enable it to serve as an efficient photocontrolled organocatalyst for ChB&#8208;assisted halide abstraction in a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation benchmark reaction.

         <title>Surface Curvature Dominated Guest&#8208;Induced Nonequilibrium Deformations of Single Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;300 Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach allows the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual covalent organic framework COF&#8208;300 crystals to be monitored in situ in real time. The spatiotemporal resolution of DFM allows transient and nonequilibrium intermediate states to be investigated, revealing the diverse surface&#8208;curvature&#8208;driven adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane.







Abstract
Understanding the guest&#8208;induced dynamic deformation process of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is vitally important to further increase their stimulus&#8208;response performances. Here we report on the dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach to in situ monitor the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual COF&#8208;300 crystals in real time. We observe not only transient and nonequilibrium intermediate deformation states but also local surface curvature&#8208;driven diverse adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane (DCM), undergoing one, two, and multiple expansion&#8208;contraction deformations as well as contraction&#8208;to&#8208;expansion transition. The surface curvature&#8208;dominated deformations are ascribed to the significant differences in the adsorption capacity for DCM at the curved tip and flat side regions, in which DCM can be adsorbed preferentially by curved tip regions of COF&#8208;300.

         <title>Potent De Novo Macrocyclic Peptides That Inhibit O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase through an Allosteric Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) system led to macrocyclic peptide ligands of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). The most potent of these ligands bind to the tetratricopeptide repeat region of OGT and inhibit this enzyme in an allosteric manner, making them promising tool compounds for studying OGT.







Abstract
Glycosyltransferases are a superfamily of enzymes that are notoriously difficult to inhibit. Here we apply an mRNA display technology integrated with genetic code reprogramming, referred to as the RaPID (random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery) system, to identify macrocyclic peptides with high binding affinities for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). These macrocycles inhibit OGT activity through an allosteric mechanism that is driven by their binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT. Saturation mutagenesis in a maturation screen using 39 amino acids, including 22 non&#8208;canonical residues, led to an improved unnatural macrocycle that is &#8776;40&#8197;times more potent than the parent compound (Kiapp=1.5&#8197;nM). Subsequent derivatization delivered a biotinylated derivative that enabled one&#8208;step affinity purification of OGT from complex samples. The high potency and novel mechanism of action of these OGT ligands should enable new approaches to elucidate the specificity and regulation of OGT.

         <title>Unveiling the High&#8208;valence Oxygen Degradation Across the Delithiated Cathode Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining synchrotron&#8208;based mRAS and APXPS, an integrated high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation scenario is established at the cathode surface. Compared with mRIXS, mRAS verified oxygen valence decrease from bulk to surface. APXPS further proves the CEI layer oxidized and deteriorated by O2. The high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation involving valence, chemical, and mechanical change can be general surface fading behavior in ARR active cathodes.







Abstract
Charge compensation on anionic redox reaction (ARR) has been promising to realize extra capacity beyond transition metal redox in battery cathodes. The practical development of ARR capacity has been hindered by high&#8208;valence oxygen instability, particularly at cathode surfaces. However, the direct probe of surface oxygen behavior has been challenging. Here, the electronic states of surface oxygen are investigated by combining mapping of resonant Auger electronic spectroscopy (mRAS) and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) on a model LiCoO2 cathode. The mRAS verified that no high&#8208;valence oxygen can sustain at cathode surfaces, while APXPS proves that cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer evolves and oxidizes upon oxygen gas contact. This work provides valuable insights into the high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation mode across the interface. Oxygen stabilization from surface architecture is proven a prerequisite to the practical development of ARR active cathodes.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Nanobarrel that Hosts and Solubilizes C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows and a diameter of 12.7&#8197;&#197; has been synthesized that is optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, and results in stable solutions of C60.







Abstract
Organic cages have gained increasing attention in recent years as molecular hosts and porous materials. Among these, barrel&#8208;shaped cages or molecular nanobarrels are promising systems to encapsulate large hosts as they possess windows of the same size as their internal cavity. However, these systems have received little attention and remain practically unexplored despite their potential. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows with a diameter of 12.7&#8197;&#197; optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, providing stable solutions of C60.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogenation with Hydrogen Spillover Enabled by Nitrogen Vacancies on Boron Nitride&#8208;Supported Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous hydrogenation with hydrogen spillover has been demonstrated as an effective route to achieve high selectivity towards target products. More effort should be paid to understand the complicated correlation between the nature of supports and hydrogenation involving hydrogen spillover. Herein, we report the development of the hydrogenation system of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN)&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for the hydrogenation of aldehyde/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. Nitrogen vacancies in h&#8208;BN determine the feasibility of hydrogen spillover from Pd to h&#8208;BN. The hydrogenation of aldehyde/ketones with hydrogen spillover from Pd proceeds on nitrogen vacancies on h&#8208;BN. The weak adsorption of alcohols to h&#8208;BN inhibits the deep hydrogenation of aldehyde/ketones, thus leading to high catalytic selectivity to alcohols. Moreover, the hydrogen spillover&#8208;based hydrogenation mechanism makes the catalyst system exhibit a high tolerance to CO poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Side Chain Conformation on the Activity of Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substrate side chain conformation impacts reactivity during glycosylation and glycoside hydrolysis and is restricted by many glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during catalysis. We show that the side chains of gluco and manno iminosugars can be restricted to predominant conformations by strategic installation of a methyl group. Glycosidase inhibition studies reveal that iminosugars with the gauche,gauche side chain conformations are 6&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more potent than isosteric compounds with the gauche,trans conformation; a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche conformation is a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic benefits of preorganization, particularly when in synergy with favorable hydrophobic interactions. The demonstration that inhibitor side chain preorganization can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition paves the way for improved inhibitor design through conformational preorganization.</dc:description>

         <title>Superconductivity in an Orbital&#8208;reoriented SnAs Square Lattice: a Case Study of Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs&#8208;based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record&#8208;high Tc among all synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane pz orbital to the in&#8208;plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p&#8208;orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconducting systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the CO2 Hydrogenation Selectivity of Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Zirconium Dioxide with Alkali Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the coordination environments of metal single atoms (M1) in single&#8208;atom catalysts has shown large impacts on catalytic activity and stability but often barely on selectivity in thermocatalysis. Here, we report that simultaneously regulating both Rh1 atoms and ZrO2 support with alkali ions (e.g., Na) enables efficient switching of the reaction products from nearly 100% CH4 to above 99% CO in CO2 hydrogenation in a wide temperature range (240&#8208; 440 &#176;C) along with a record high activity of 9.4 molCO&#183;gRh&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at 300 &#176;C and long&#8208;term stability. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations unveil that alkali ions on ZrO2 change the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species during CO2 activation, thus leading to exclusive CO formation. Meanwhile, alkali ions also reinforce the electronic Rh1&#8208;support interactions, endowing the Rh1 atoms more electron deficient, which improves the stability against sintering and inhibits deep hydrogenation of CO to CH4.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu&#8208;NCs) with high chemical stability is a prerequisite for practical applications, yet still remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we have prepared a pyrazolate&#8208;protected Cu&#8208;NC&#160;(Cu8), which exhibited exceptional chemical stability either in solid&#8208;state or in solution. The crystals of&#160;Cu8&#160;are still suitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis even after being treated with boiling water, 8 wt% H2O2, high concentrated acid (1 M HCl) or saturated base (~ 20 M KOH), respectively. More importantly, the structure of&#160;Cu8&#160;in solution also remained intact toward oxygen, organic acid (100 eq. HOAc) or base (400 eq. dibutylamine) confirmed by&#160;1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis analysis. Taking advantage of high alkali&#8208;resistant,&#160;Cu8&#160;illustrates excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of indolizines, and it can be reused for at least 10 cycles without losing catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Actinorhodin Biosynthesis Terminates with an Unprecedented Biaryl Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last dimerization step of actinorhodin (ACT) biosynthesis was established through biochemical studies. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the biaryl&#8208;coupling reaction using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. ActVA&#8208;ORF3 is a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that forms DHK&#8208;OH and ACT. The present results complete the functional assignment of essential enzymes for ACT biosynthesis.







Abstract
A plethora of dimeric natural products exist with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. A major strategy for dimerization is aryl coupling catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or laccase. Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has a dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone structure connected by a C&#8722;C bond. In this study, we identified an NmrA&#8208;family dimerizing enzyme, ActVA&#8208;ORF4, and a cofactor&#8208;independent oxidase, ActVA&#8208;ORF3, both involved in the last step of ACT biosynthesis. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. On the other hand, ActVA&#8208;ORF3 was found to be a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that produces the coupling substrate, DHK&#8208;OH and the final product, ACT. Consequently, the functional assignment of all essential enzymes in the biosynthesis of ACT, one of the best&#8208;known model natural products, has been completed.

&lt;p&gt;The last dimerization step of actinorhodin (ACT) biosynthesis was established through biochemical studies. ActVA-ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the biaryl-coupling reaction using 8-hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK-OH) as the sole substrate. ActVA-ORF3 is a quinone-forming enzyme that forms DHK-OH and ACT. The present results complete the functional assignment of essential enzymes for ACT biosynthesis.

         <title>I2&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;Cycloisomerization of Ynamides: Chemoselective and Divergent Access to Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, furnishing various functionalized bis(indole) derivatives in generally good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and excellent atom&#8208;economy. This protocol not only represents the first molecular&#8208;iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations, but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage and rearrangement. Moreover, chiral tetrahydropyridine frameworks containing two stereocenters are obtained with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. Meanwhile, cycloisomerization and aromatization of ynamides produce pyrrolyl indoles with high efficiency enabled by I2. Additionally, control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that this reaction probably undergoes a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/rearrangement process.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Crystalline and Amorphous Metal&#8211;Organic Complex for Transformation of Photosalient Effect and Positive&#8211;Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncovering differences between crystalline and amorphous states in molecular solids would both promote the understanding of their structure&#8208;property relationships, as well as inform development of multi&#8208;functional materials based on the same compound. Herein, for the first time,&#160;we report an approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states&#160;of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex, which exhibited negative and positive photochromism, due to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, different polymorphs lead to the on/off toggling of photo&#8208;burst movement (photosalient effect), indicating the controllable light&#8208;mechanical conversion. Three demos were further constructed to support their application in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of a state&#8208; and polymorph&#8208;dependent photochemical route, paving an effective way for the design of new dynamically responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Edge of the Known: Extremely Electron&#8208;rich (Di)carboranyl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses of the first B9&#8208;connected carboranylphosphines (B9&#8208;Phos) featuring two carboranyl moieties as well as access to B9&#8208;Phos ligands with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents, previously deemed unattainable, is reported. The electrochemical properties of the B9&#8208;Phos ligands were investigated, revealing the ability of the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations. The B9&#8208;Phos ligands display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character surpassing that of alkyl phosphines and commonly used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. This is demonstrated by their very small Tolman electronic parameters (TEPs) as well as extremely low P&#8210;Se coupling constants. Cone angles and buried volumes attest to the high steric demand exerted by the (di)carboranyl phosphines. The dicarboranyl phosphine AuI complexes show superior catalytic performance in the hydroamination of alkynes compared to the monocarboranyl phosphine analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Fast Charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte design has become ever more important to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the flammability issue and high reactivity of the conventional electrolytes remain a major problem, especially when the LIBs are operated at high voltage and extreme temperatures. Herein, we design a novel non&#8208;flammable fluorinated ester electrolyte that enables high cycling stability in wide&#8208;temperature variations (e.g., &#8208;50&#176;C~60&#176;C) and superior power capability (fast charge rates up to 5.0 C) for the graphite || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery at high voltage (i.e., &gt; 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+). Moreover, this work sheds new light on the dynamic evolution and interaction among the Li+, solvent, and anion at the molecular level. By elucidating the fundamental relationship between the Li+ solvation structure and electrochemical performance, we can facilitate the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operating in harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Structure Transition and Peroxidase Mimic Activity of Copper Sites Over Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of systematic structural resolution makes it difficult to build specific transition metal atoms&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots&#160;(TMAs&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs). Herein, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between Cu atoms and CPDs was evaluated by studying the peroxidase&#8208;like properties of Glu&#8208;Cu&#8208;CPDs prepared by using copper glutamate (Glu) with Cu&#8208;N2O2 initial structure. The results showed that the Cu atoms bound to Glu&#8208;Cu&#8208;CPDs in the form of Cu&#8208;N2C2, indicating that Cu&#8208;O bonds changed into Cu&#8208;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in other Cu&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs. Moreover, the carboxyl and amino groups content decreased after Cu&#8208;atom doping. Theoretical calculations revealed a dual&#8208;site catalytic mechanism for catalyzing H2O2. Eventually, the detection of intracellular H2O2 suggested their application prospects. Our work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding on the formation and catalysis mechanism of TMAs&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs, allowing for building specific TMAs&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lack of systematic structural resolution makes it difficult to build specific transition metal atoms-doped carbonized polymer dots&#160;(TMAs-doped-CPDs). Herein, the structure-activity relationship between Cu atoms and CPDs was evaluated by studying the peroxidase-like properties of Glu-Cu-CPDs prepared by using copper glutamate (Glu) with Cu-N2O2 initial structure. The results showed that the Cu atoms bound to Glu-Cu-CPDs in the form of Cu-N2C2, indicating that Cu-O bonds changed into Cu-C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in other Cu-doped-CPDs. Moreover, the carboxyl and amino groups content decreased after Cu-atom doping. Theoretical calculations revealed a dual-site catalytic mechanism for catalyzing H2O2. Eventually, the detection of intracellular H2O2 suggested their application prospects. Our work provides an in-depth understanding on the formation and catalysis mechanism of TMAs-doped-CPDs, allowing for building specific TMAs-doped-CPDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering p&#8208;Band Center of Oxygen Boosting H+ Intercalation in&#160;&#948;&#8208;MnO2 for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), the H+&#160;intercalation&#160;possesses superior electrochemical kinetics with excellent rate capability, however, precisely modulating H+&#160;intercalation has been still challenging. Herein, a critical modification of pre&#8208;intercalating metal ions in the MnO2&#160;interlayer (M&#8208;MnO2)&#160;with controllable p&#8208;band center (&#949;p) of O is reported to modulate the H+&#160;intercalation. The modulation of metal&#8208;O bond type and covalency degree on the average charge of O atom results in&#160;optimized &#949;p&#160;and H+&#160;adsorption energy for M&#8208;MnO2, thus promoting the balance between H+&#160;adsorption and desorption, which plays a determinant role on H+&#160;intercalation. The optimized Cu&#8208;MnO2&#160;delivers superior rate capability with the capacity of 153 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at a high rate of 3 A g&#8208;1&#160;after 1000 cycles. This work demonstrates that &#949;p&#160;could be a significant descriptor for H+&#160;intercalation, and tuning &#949;p&#160;effectively increases&#160;H+&#160;intercalation contribution&#160;with excellent rate capability in ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>An All&#8208;Natural Wood&#8208;Inspired Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting surface nanocrystallization method was developed to make the surface&#8208;inert and weakly interacting wood particles better assemble to construct the aerogel. This bottom&#8208;up method allows the preparation of large&#8208;size composite aerogels. The wood&#8208;inspired oriented channel structure endows the obtained aerogel with superior thermal insulation properties to natural wood and most existing commercial sponges.







Abstract
The oriented pore structure of wood endows it with a variety of outstanding properties, among which the low thermal conductivity has attracted researchers to develop wood&#8208;like aerogels as excellent thermal insulation materials. However, the increasing demands of environmental protection have put forward new and strict requirements for the sustainability of aerogels. Here, we report an all&#8208;natural wood&#8208;inspired aerogel consisting of all&#8208;natural ingredients and develop a method to activate the surface&#8208;inert wood particles to construct the aerogel. The obtained wood&#8208;inspired aerogel has channel structure similar to that of natural wood, endowing it with superior thermal insulation properties to most existing commercial sponges. In addition, remarkable fire retardancy and complete biodegradability are integrated. With the above outstanding performances, this sustainable wood&#8208;inspired aerogel will be an ideal substitute for the existing commercial thermal insulation materials.
