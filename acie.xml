         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100% under high humid condition (75% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804; 7.1%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8208;O&#8208;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57 eV lower than dry conditions).</dc:description>

         <title>Gradually Tuning the Flexibility of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks via Stepwise Structural Transformation and Their Flexibility&#8208;Dependent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing for their dynamic properties distinctive from rigid counterparts but still suffer from limited accessibility. Especially, controlling flexibility of COFs is challenging and the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs has rarely been unveiled. This article reports stepwise adjustment on flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional COFs, which is realized by the designed synthesis of rigid COF (R&#8208;COF), semi&#8208;flexible COF (SF&#8208;COF), and flexible COF (F&#8208;COF) through polymerization, linker exchange, and linkage conversion with a newly developed method for reduction of hydrazone, respectively. Significant difference in breathing behavior and self&#8208;adaptive capability of the three COFs are uncovered through vapor response and iodine capture experiments. Gas sorption experiments indicate that the porosity of F&#8208;COF could switch from "close" state in nitrogen to "open" state in carbon dioxide, which are not observed for R&#8208;COF and SF&#8208;COF. This study not only develops a strategy to adjust the flexibility of COFs by tuning their linkers and linkages, but also provides a deep insight into the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs, which lays a foundation for the development of this new class of dynamic porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Anti&#8208;Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumor and produce cytotoxic species, therefore are promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature that enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposome. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of intermediate product H2O2 as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in anti&#8208;tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered a potential alternative to high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high reactivity of metallic sodium towards common liquid organic electrolytes renders such battery technology particularly challenging. Herein, we propose a multi&#8208;block single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) doped with ethylene carbonate as suitable electrolyte system for SMBs. This novel SIPE provides a very high ionic conductivity (2.6 mS cm&#8208;1) and an electrochemical stability window of about 4.1 V at 40 &#176;C, enabling stable sodium stripping and plating and excellent rate capability of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells up to 2C. Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Zweifel Olefination and its Mechanistic Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective Zweifel olefination using boronate complexes carrying two different reactive &#960;&#8208;systems was achieved to synthesize vinyl heteroarenes and conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes in good yield and up to 100% stereoselectivity, which remains unexplored until now. Most importantly, we report the unprecedented formation of E vs. Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes for different heteroarenes under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) investigations unveil the mechanistic dichotomy between olefin and heteroarene activation followed by 1,2&#8208;migration, leading to E or Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes respectively. We also report a previously unknown reversal of stereoselectivity by using 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as an electrophile. The Zweifel olefination using a boronate complex that carries two different olefins was previously unexplored due to significant challenges associated with the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins. We have solved this problem and reported the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing F/P Hybrid Polymer as Ultrastable Cationic Shielding&#160;Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendrite growth on electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase has severely limited applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we developed an ionic alternating polymer with fluorocarbons and phosphonium cations in repeating units to regulate Li deposition for the first time. The combined functionalities in the F/P hybrid polymer exhibit remarkable characteristics as a protective layer on top of Li anode, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical stability, ion flux redistributing capability and adaptive chain mobility. Based on characterizations and simulations, this cationic interlayer could effectively furnish long&#8208;standing electrostatic shielding for anodes, allowing restrained coating decomposition and homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, and enabling full cells with enhanced rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Given the importance of LMBs, this work will promote polymer design to stabilize anodes with superior electrochemical behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>

A novel dual&#8208;defect MOF which incorporates both linker defect and cluster defects as a new type of sulfur catalyst to achieve targeted and synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of polysulfides.







Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Accelerated conversion by catalysis can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced Li&#8722;S performance. However, a catalyst with single active site cannot simultaneously accelerate multiple LiPSs conversion. Herein, we developed a novel dual&#8208;defect (missing linker and missing cluster defects) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new type of catalyst to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of LiPSs. Electrochemical tests and first&#8208;principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that different defects can realize targeted acceleration of stepwise reaction kinetics for LiPSs. Specifically, the missing linker defects can selectively accelerate the conversion of S8&#8594;Li2S4, while the missing cluster defects can catalyze the reaction of Li2S4&#8594;Li2S, so as to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. Hence, the Li&#8722;S battery with an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivers a capacity of 1087&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after 100&#8197;cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 12.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and E/S=3.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1, an areal capacity of 10.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 45&#8197;cycles can still be obtained.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher&#8208;Order Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical cyclic peptides constructed by dynamic covalent chemistry provide a platform for the investigation of naturally occurring chirality inversion, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, and hierarchical assembly. The insertion of a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. The reversibility can be tuned by changing the pH value without producing other chemical waste except water.







Abstract
Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulting asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures. Different from traditional cyclic D,L peptides, the formation of 4&#8208;imidazolidinone promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. Analysis of the nanostructures confirmed the left&#8208;handedness, representing chirality induced self&#8208;assembly. This proves that a rationally designed peptide can mimic multiple natural phenomena and could promote the development of functional biomaterials, catalysts, antibiotics, and supermolecules.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral 1,2-diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition-metal-based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2-diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)-catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo-protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2-diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;-secondary and &#945;-tertiary-1,2-diamines, for which a two-step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Molecular Z&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System Under the Bias&#8208;Free Condition for CO&#8322; Reduction Coupled with&#160;Water Oxidation: Photocatalytic Production of CO/HCOOH and H&#8322;O&#8322;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;inspired molecular&#8208;engineered systems have been extensively investigated for the half&#8208;reactions of H2O oxidation or CO2 reduction with sacrificial electron donors/acceptors. However, there has yet to be reported a device for dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photoanodes coupled with molecular photocathodes in an aqueous solution without the use of sacrificial reagents. Herein, we will report the integration of Sn(IV)&#8208; or Al(III)&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (SnTPyP or AlTPyP) decorated tin oxide particles (SnTPyP/SnO2 or AlTPyP/SnO2) photoanode with the dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photocathode on nickel oxide particles containing [Ru(diimine)3]2+ as the light&#8208;harvesting unit and [Ru(diimine)(CO)2Cl2] as the catalyst unit covalently connected and fixed within poly&#8208;pyrrole layer (RuCAT&#8208;RuC2&#8208;PolyPyr&#8208;PRu/NiO). The simultaneous irradiation of the two photoelectrodes with visible light resulted in H2O2 on the anode and mainly HCOOH with CO and H2 as minor products on the cathode with high Faradaic efficiencies in purely aqueous conditions without any applied bias is the first example of artificial photosynthesis with only two&#8208;electron redox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquids with Permanent Macroporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Permanent macropores (&gt;50 nm) had not been reported in the liquid state until a recent report by Tao Li and coworkers, describing a synthetic strategy to form a porous liquid with dual micro&#8208;macroporosity. This is prepared by producing hierarchically porous particles that are surface coated and fluidised by dispersion. Surface micropores enable permanent porosity by steric exclusion of the fluid phase. The material has a considerable water uptake capacity (27% w/w) due to large (480 nm) unoccupied macropores. This also enables switching of thermal conductivity on uptake of water. These are new properties translated from porous solids to the liquid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Correlation of Cross&#8208;linking Modes with Mechanical Properties for Dynamic Polymeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneously introducing covalent and supramolecular cross&#8208;links into one system to construct dually cross&#8208;linked networks, has been proved an effective approach to prepare high&#8208;performance materials. However, so far, features and advantages of dually cross&#8208;linked networks compared with those possessing individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linking points are rarely investigated. Herein, on the basis of comparison between supramolecular polymer network (SPN), covalent polymer network (CPN) and dually cross&#8208;linked polymer network (DPN), we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking strategy can endow the DPN with integrated advantages of CPN and SPN. Benefiting from the energy dissipative ability along with the dissociation of host&#8722;guest complexes, the DPN shows excellent toughness and ductility similar to the SPN. Meanwhile, the elasticity of covalent cross&#8208;links in the DPN could rise the structural stability to a level comparable to the CPN, exhibiting quick deformation recovery capacity. Moreover, the DPN has the strongest breaking stress and puncture resistance among the three, proving the unique property advantages of dual cross&#8208;linking method. These findings gained from our study further deepen the understanding of dynamic polymeric networks and facilitate the preparation of high&#8208;performance elastomeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin Supramolecule as Surface Carrier Modulator Imparts Hole Transporter with Enhanced Mobility for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the surface charge transport behavior of hole transport materials (HTMs) would be as an potential approach to improve their hole mobility, while yet realized for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an oxygen bridged dimer&#8208;based monoamine Fe(III) porphyrin supramolecule is prepared and doped in HTM film. Theoretical analyses reveal that the polaron distributed on dimer can be coupled with the parallel arranged polarons on adjacent dimers. This polaron coupling at the interface of supramolecule and HTM can resonates with hole flux to increase hole transport efficiency. Mobility tests reveal that the hole mobility of doped HTM film is improved by 8&#8208;fold. Doped perovskite device exhibits an increased efficiency from 19.8% to 23.2%, and greatly improved stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the mobility of HTMs by surface carrier modulation, therefore fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;iG: Simultaneous Enrichment and Profiling of Intact N&#8208;linked, O&#8208;GalNAc, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Glycopeptides</title>

         <dc:description>
A glycoproteomics platform, Click&#8208;iG, is reported that integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides.







Abstract
Proteins are ubiquitously modified with glycans of varied chemical structures through distinct glycosidic linkages, making the landscape of protein glycosylation challenging to map. Profiling of intact glycopeptides with mass spectrometry (MS) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for revealing matched information of the glycosylation sites and attached glycans (i.e., intact glycosites), but is largely limited to individual glycosylation types. Herein, we describe Click&#8208;iG, which integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides. We demonstrate the utility of Click&#8208;iG by the identification of thousands of intact glycosites in cell lines and living mice. From the mouse lung, heart, and spleen, a total of 2053 intact N&#8208;glycosites, 262 intact O&#8208;GalNAc glycosites, and 1947 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation sites were identified. Click&#8208;iG&#8208;enabled comprehensive coverage of the protein glycosylation landscape lays the foundation for interrogating crosstalk between different glycosylation pathways.

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen
</title>

         <dc:description>
Fast, low&#8208;cost parahydrogen&#8208;hyperpolarization via Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) enables in vivo metabolic magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate the first in vivo application of SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 in a purified, aqueous solution with &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;%, obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering. This achievement paves the way for affordable and widespread metabolic imaging applications.







Abstract
Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6&#8197;minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;% (residual 250&#8197;mM methanol and 20&#8197;&#956;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.

         <title>Infrared Multiphoton Dissociation Enables Top&#8208;Down Characterization of Membrane Protein Complexes and G Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top&#8208;down mass spectrometry using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) of native membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides good sequence coverage from native protein ions. We observe successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids, specifically within transmembrane helices, enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are challenging to analyze by native mass spectrometry (MS) as their hydrophobic nature typically requires stabilization in detergent micelles that are removed prior to analysis via collisional activation. There is however a practical limit to the amount of energy which can be applied, which often precludes subsequent characterization by top&#8208;down MS. To overcome this barrier, we have applied a modified Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to an infrared laser within a high&#8208;pressure linear ion trap. We show how tuning the intensity and time of incident photons enables liberation of membrane proteins from detergent micelles. Specifically, we relate the ease of micelle removal to the infrared absorption of detergents in both condensed and gas phases. Top&#8208;down MS via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), results in good sequence coverage enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes. By contrasting and comparing the fragmentation patterns of the ammonia channel with two class A GPCRs, we identify successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids within transmembrane domains. Using gas&#8208;phase molecular dynamics simulations, we show that areas prone to fragmentation maintain aspects of protein structure at increasing temperatures. Altogether, we propose a rationale to explain why and where in the protein fragment ions are generated.

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts, a judicious combination of ion&#8208;pair elements with peptide scaffolds that bear multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors, have captivated considerable attention for their unprecedented performance in a plethora of enantioselective transformations, in many cases enabling never&#8208;before&#8208;seen patterns of reactivity and selectivity. In this context, we provide a succinct overview of recent progress in this field.







Abstract
Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Toward Sustainable Metal&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Materials, Electrochemistry and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes three types of iodine cathodes with their reaction mechanisms and highlights progress of various metal anodes and optimization strategies in metal&#8208;iodine batteries. The possibility of alternate metal anodes and their design strategy is enlightened. To build sustainable batteries, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues.







Abstract
Due to the natural abundance of iodine, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainability, metal&#8208;iodine batteries are competitive for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density, and large power density. However, the inherent properties of iodine such as electronic insulation and shuttle behavior of soluble iodine species affect negatively rate performance, cyclability, and self&#8208;discharge behavior of metal&#8208;iodine batteries, while the dendrite growth and metal corrosion on the anode side brings potential safety hazards and inferior durability. These problems of metal&#8208;iodine system still exist and need to be solved urgently. Herein, we summarize the research progress of metal&#8208;iodine batteries in the past decades. Firstly, the classification, design strategy and reaction mechanism of iodine electrode are briefly outlined. Secondly, the current development and protection strategy of conventional metal anodes in metal&#8208;iodine batteries are highlighted, and some potential anode materials and their design strategies are proposed. Thirdly, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues for realizing next&#8208;generation iodine&#8208;based energy storage systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to promote the development of metal&#8208;iodine batteries and provide guidelines for their design.

         <title>An Interfacial View of Cation Effects on Electrocatalysis Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolytes has been recently introduced as a crucial factor to tailor the kinetics and Faradaic efficiency of many electrocatalytic reactions. In this Minireview, we have summarized the recent advances in the molecular&#8208;level understanding of cation effects on relevant electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) reactions. The discussion covers the effects of electrolyte cations on interfacial electric fields, structural organization of interfacial water molecules, blocking the catalytic active sites, stabilization or destabilization of intermediates, and interfacial pHs. These cation&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena have been reported to impact the performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) of electrochemical reactions collaboratively or independently. We describe that although there is almost a general agreement on the relationship between the size of alkali cations and the activities of HER, OER, and CO2RR, however, the mechanism by which the performance of these electrocatalytic reactions is influenced by alkali metal cations is still in debate.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular alcohol click chemistry enables facile synthesis of recyclable polymers with tunable structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers derived from sustainable feedstocks presents enormous challenges. Here, we develop a novel, modular, and efficient click reaction for connecting primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols with activated alkenes via a bridge molecule of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The click reaction is successfully applied to synthesize a series of recyclable polymers by the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS. Diols and diacrylates are common chemicals and can be produced from biorenewable sources, and COS is released as the industrial waste. In addition to sustainable monomers, the approach is atom&#8208;economical, wide in scope, metal&#8208;free, and performed under mild conditions, affording unprecedented polymers with nearly quantitative yields. The produced polymers also possess predesigned and widely tunable structure owing to the versatility of our method and the broad variety of monomers. The in&#8208;chain thiocarbonate and ester polar groups can play as breakpoints, allowing these polymers to be easily recycled. Overall, the polymers have broad prospects for green materials given their facile synthesis, readily available feedstocks, desirable performance, and chemical recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Homo&#8208;Mannich Reaction Strategy Enables Collective Access to Ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with iminium ion generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core, which is shared by a variety of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids across families. Through this skeleton&#8208;constructing process, an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center as well as an allyl and a ketone groups were installed. Using this functionalized hydrocarbazole as the structural platform, D ring and E rings of different sizes (i.e., five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered) were successively or simultaneously assembled, leading to a collective asymmetric synthesis of seven alkaloids belonging to the ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloid families.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofilm&#8208;associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant&#8208;associated infections, making them a major public&#8208;health concern. Early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early&#8208;stage and matured&#8208;biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet&#8208;printing, forming a part of near&#8208;field&#8208;communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly&#8208;conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8208;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time presents the evidence showcasing that electrons released through the actions of bacteria can be harnessed to convert AgCl to Ag, thus enabling the wireless, battery&#8208;less, and chip&#8208;less early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific m6A Erasing via Conditionally Stabilized CRISPR&#8208;Cas13b Editor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) on RNAs plays an important role in regulating various biological processes and CRIPSR technology has been employed for programmable m6A editing. However, the bulky size of CRISPR protein and constitutively expressed CRISPR/RNA editing enzymes can interfere with the native function of target RNAs and cells. Herein, we reported a conditional m6A editing platform (FKBP*&#8208;dCas13b&#8208;ALK) based on a ligand stabilized dCas13 editor. The inducible expression of this m6A editing system was achieved by adding or removing the Shield&#8208;1 molecule. We further demonstrated that the targeted recruitment of dCas13b&#8208;m6A eraser fusion protein and site&#8208;specific m6A erasing were achieved under the control of Shield&#8208;1. Moreover, the release and degradation of dCas13b fusion protein occurred faster than the restoration of m6A on the target RNAs after Shield&#8208;1 removal, which provides an ideal opportunity to study the m6A function with minimal steric interference from bulky dCas13b fusion protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficiencies of Various in&#8208;situ Polymerizations of Liquid Electrolytes and the Practical Implications for Quasi Solid&#8208;state Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ polymerization of liquid electrolytes is currently the most feasible way for constructing solid&#8208;state batteries, which, however, is affected by various interfering factors of reactions and so the electrochemical performance of cells. To disclose the effects from polymerization conditions, two types of generally used in&#8208;situ polymerizing reactions of ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and double bond radical polymerization (DBRP) were investigated on the aspects of monomer conversion and electrochemical properties (Li+&#8208;conductivity and interfacial stability). The ROP generated poly&#8208;ester and poly&#8208;carbonate show a high monomer conversion of ~90%, but suffer a poor Li+&#8208;conductivity of lower than 2 &#215; 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature (RT). Additionally, the terminal alkoxy anion derived from the ROP is not resistant to high&#8208;voltage cathodes. While, the DBRP produced poly&#8208;VEC(vinyl ethylene carbonate) and poly&#8208;VC(vinylene carbonate) show lower monomer conversions of 50&#8208;80%, delivering relatively higher Li+&#8208;conductivities of 2 x 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at RT. Compared two polymerizing reactions and four monomers, the VEC&#8208;based F&#8208;containing copolymer possesses advantages in Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidant capacity, which also shows simultaneous stability towards Li&#8208;metal with the help of LiF&#8208;based passivating layer, allowing a long&#8208;term stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage quasi solid&#8208;state cells.</dc:description>

an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on

         <title>A Nuclearity&#8208;Dependent Enantiodivergent Epoxide Opening via Enthalpy&#8208;Controlled Mononuclear and Entropy&#8208;Controlled Dinuclear (Salen)Titanium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed, in which both antipodes of chiral alcohol products are selectively accessed by mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Kinetic studies based on the Eyring equation revealed an enthalpy&#8208;controlled enantio&#8208;differentiation mode in mononuclear catalysis, whereas an entropy&#8208;controlled one in dinuclear catalysis. DFT calculations outline the origin of the enantiocontrol of the mononuclear catalysis and indicate the actual catalyst species in the dinuclear catalytic system. The mechanistic insights may shed a light on a strategy for stereoswichable asymmetric catalysis utilizing nuclearity&#8208;distinct transition&#8208;metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Ruthenium Content Confined on Boron Carbon Nitride as an Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, only a few noble metal oxides exhibit the required efficiency and stability as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under the acidic, high&#8208;voltage conditions that exist during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). The high cost and scarcity of these catalysts hinder the large&#8208;scale application of PEMWE. Here, we report a novel OER electrocatalyst for OER comprised of uniformly dispersed Ru clusters confined on boron carbon nitride (BCN) support. Compared to RuO2, our BCN&#8208;supported catalyst shows enhanced charge transfer. It displays a low overpotential of 164 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, suggesting its excellent OER catalytic activity. This catalyst was able to operate continuously for over 12 h under acidic conditions, whereas RuO2 without any support fails in 1 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the interaction between the N on BCN support and Ru clusters changes the adsorption capacity and reduces the OER energy barrier, which increases the electrocatalytic activity of Ru.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Interlayer Distance and Heteroatom&#8208;Doping of Graphite Provide New Insights into the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Mechanism in Dual&#8208;Carbon Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, it is still questionable how material structures affect the anion storage behavior. In this paper, we synthesis graphite with an ultra&#8208;large interlayer distance and heteroatomic doping to systematically investigate the combined effects on DIBs. The large interlayer distance of 0.51 nm provides more space for anion storage, while the doping of the heteroatoms reduces the energy barriers for anion intercalation and migration and enhances rapid ionic storage at interfaces simultaneously. Based on the synergistic effects, the DIBs composed of carbon cathode and lithium anode afford ultra&#8208;high capacity of 240 mA h g&#8208;1 at current density of 100 mA g&#8208;1. Dual&#8208;carbon batteries (DCBs) using the graphite as both of cathode and anode steadily cycle 2400 times at current density of 1 A g&#8208;1. Hence, this work provides a reference to the strategy of material designs of DIBs and DCBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Degradation Pathways of Polymers by Radical&#8208;Triggered Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the radical behaviours during polymer degradation is beneficial to unveil and regulate the degradation pathways of polymers to achieve a sustainable polymer development. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to study radical behaviours owing to the ultra&#8208;short lifetime of the transient radicals generated during the polymer degradation. In this contribution, we have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to&#160;monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation without/with the addition of inorganic additives. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from peroxy radicals (ROO&#8226;) emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways with the addition of additives, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with positively charged Al centers, could be modulated into a double sigmoidal dynamics, involving a main product of alkoxy radicals&#160;&#160;(RO&#8226;) with the activation energy of 40.2 kJ/mol and a small amount of&#160;&#160;ROO&#8226; with 76.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Accordingly, the polymers with the additive&#8208;regulated pathways could exhibit prominently anti&#8208;degradation behaviours. This work is beneficial for the deep understanding of the radical mechanisms during polymer degradation, and for the rational design of anti&#8208;degradation polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ketyl Radical Anion Mediated Radical Polymerization and Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization to Give Polymers with Low Molecular Weight Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One ketyl radical anion can enable a 3&#8211;3 coupling reaction, radical polymerization at a carbon radical site, and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at an oxygen anion site. This results in simultaneous organic synthesis and polymerization in one pot; thereby cyclopentane derivates and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of novel polymerization capable of yielding polymers with low molecular weight distribution (&#272;) is essential and significant in polymer chemistry, where monofunctional initiator contains only one initiation site in these polymerizations generally. Here, ketyl radical anion species is introduced to develop a novel Ketyl Mediated Polymerization (KMP), which enables radical polymerization at carbon radical site and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization at oxygen anion site, respectively. Meanwhile, polymerization and corresponding organic synthesis generally couldn't be performed simultaneously in one pot. Through KMP, organic synthesis and polymerization are achieved in one pot, where small molecules (cyclopentane derivates) and polymers with low &#272; are successfully prepared under mild condition simultaneously. At the initiation step, both organic synthesis and polymerization are initiated by single electron transfer reaction with ketyl radical anion formation. Cyclopentane derivates are synthesized through 3&#8211;3 coupling reaction and cyclization. Polystyrene and polycaprolactone with low &#272; and a full monomer conversion are prepared by KMP via radical polymerization and anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, respectively. This work therefore enables both organic synthesis and two different polymerizations from same initiation system, which saves time, labour, resource and energy and expands the reaction mode and method libraries of organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.

         <title>B7Be6B7: A Boron&#8208;Beryllium Sandwich Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a previously unknown sandwich&#8208;type complex consisting of beryllium and boron, which exhibits remarkable thermochemical and kinetical stability and displays aromatic characteristics. Through chemical bonding analysis, we show that B7Be6B7 can be conceptualized as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex.







Abstract
Planar boron clusters have often been regarded as &#8220;&#960;&#8208;analogous&#8221; to aromatic arenes because of their similar delocalized &#960;&#8208;bonding. However, unlike arenes such as C5H5&#8722; and C6H6, boron clusters have not previously shown the ability to form sandwich complexes. In this study, we present the first sandwich complex involving beryllium and boron, B7Be6B7. The global minimum of this combination adopts a unique architecture having a D6h geometry, featuring an unprecedented monocyclic Be6 ring sandwiched between two quasi&#8208;planar B7 motifs. The thermochemical and kinetic stability of B7Be6B7 can be attributed to strong electrostatic and covalent interactions between the fragments. Chemical bonding analysis shows that B7Be6B7 can be considered as a [B7]3&#8722;[Be6]6+[B7]3&#8722; complex. Moreover, there is a significant electron delocalization within this cluster, supported by the local diatropic contributions of the B7 and Be6 fragments.

         <title>Development of Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of [15N3]Metronidazole: A Clinically Approved Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[15N3]Metronidazole (MNZ) is an emerging hyperpolarized contrast agent. The dynamic nuclear polarization process of this clinically used antibiotic is very fast compared to many other 15N&#8208;labeled molecules and has remarkably long T1 and T2. The hyperpolarized signal of MNZ lasted for over a minute in a rat brain. Future work on hyperpolarized MNZ will investigate its potential as an antibiotic or hypoxia&#8208;sensing probe in disease models.







Abstract
We report dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) of [15N3]metronidazole ([15N3]MNZ) for the first time. Metronidazole is a clinically approved antibiotic, which can be potentially employed as a hypoxia&#8208;sensing molecular probe using 15N hyperpolarized (HP) nucleus. The DNP process is very efficient for [15N3]MNZ with an exponential build&#8208;up constant of 13.8&#8197;min using trityl radical. After dissolution and sample transfer to a nearby 4.7&#8197;T Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, HP [15N3]MNZ lasted remarkably long with T1 values up to 343&#8197;s and 15N polarizations up to 6.4&#8201;%. A time series of HP [15N3]MNZ images was acquired in vitro using a steady state free precession sequence on the 15NO2 peak. The signal lasted over 13&#8197;min with notably long T2 of 20.5&#8197;s. HP [15N3]MNZ was injected in the tail vein of a healthy rat, and dynamic spectroscopy was performed over the rat brain. The in vivo HP 15N signals persisted over 70&#8197;s, demonstrating an unprecedented opportunity for in vivo studies.

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify ruthenium&#8208;promoted allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in live A549 human lung cells. Individual turn&#8208;on events were detected as single fluorescence spots and found to occur more frequently in the mitochondria than the rest of the cell. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution is an important consideration in designing intracellular catalysts.







Abstract
Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Assisted Microfluidic Platform Enables Single&#8208;Cell Metabolite Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic platform integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing immobilized enzymes is reported. The platform could not only offer over 99&#8201;% single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency but also dynamically monitor the single&#8208;cell state by profiling the cellular metabolites glucose and extracellular lactate, thus allowing the evaluation of cell tumorigenic potential in unprocessed whole blood.







Abstract
Colonization of cancer cells at secondary sites, a decisive step in tumor metastasis, is strongly dependent on the formation of metastatic microenvironments regulated by intrinsic single&#8208;cell metabolism traits. Herein, we report a single&#8208;cell microfluidic platform for high&#8208;throughput dynamic monitoring of tumor cell metabolites to evaluate tumor malignancy. This microfluidic device empowers efficient isolation of single cells (&gt;99&#8201;%) in a squashed state similar to tumor extravasation, and employs enzyme&#8208;packaged metal&#8211;organic frameworks to catalyze tumor cell metabolites for visualization. The microfluidic evaluation was confirmed by in vivo assays, suggesting that the platform allowed predicting the tumorigenicity of captured tumor cells and screening metabolic inhibitors as anti&#8208;metastatic drugs. Furthermore, the platform efficiently detected various aggressive cancer cells in unprocessed whole blood samples with high sensitivity, showing potential for clinical application.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Oxidation by a Porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Cation Radical Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex without ancillary proton accepting ligand/groups was found to perform oxidative C&#8722;H bond activation, yielding hydroxylated substrates in the presence of air. According to kinetic studies, the nickel porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted an electron to oxidise substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism.







Abstract
Heme and chlorin &#960;&#8208;cation radical oxidants are widely implicated in biological and synthetic oxidation catalysis. Little insight into the role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals in proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation is available. We prepared a NiII&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation complex ([NiII(P&#8901;+)]) and found it to be capable of the oxidation of a variety of simple hydrocarbon substrates. Interestingly, some of the products were hydroxylated, with ([NiII(P&#8901;+)]) working in concert with atmospheric O2 to yield hydroxylated hydrocarbons. Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical species oxidised substrates through a concerted PCET mechanism, where the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non&#8208;innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.

         <title>Combining Solid&#8208;State NMR with Structural and Biophysical Techniques to Design Challenging Protein&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecule that results from the conjugation of the cytotoxic Paclitaxel and Tafamidis, and maintains a high affinity for human transthyretin, demonstrates the potential contribution of solid&#8208;state NMR to the structure&#8208;based design of novel protein&#8208;drug conjugates.







Abstract
Several protein&#8208;drug conjugates are currently being used in cancer therapy. These conjugates rely on cytotoxic organic compounds that are covalently attached to the carrier proteins or that interact with them via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Human transthyretin (TTR), a physiological protein, has already been identified as a possible carrier protein for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs. Here we show the structure&#8208;guided development of a new stable cytotoxic molecule based on a known strong binder of TTR and a well&#8208;established anticancer drug. This example is used to demonstrate the importance of the integration of multiple biophysical and structural techniques, encompassing microscale thermophoresis, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. In particular, we show that solid&#8208;state NMR has the ability to reveal effects caused by ligand binding which are more easily relatable to structural and dynamical alterations that impact the stability of macromolecular complexes.

Human transthyretin (TTR), a physiological protein, has already been identified as a possible carrier protein for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs. Here we show the structure-guided development of a new stable cytotoxic molecule based on a known strong binder of TTR and a well-established anticancer drug. This example is used to demonstrate the importance of the integration of multiple biophysical and structural techniques, encompassing microscale thermophoresis, X-ray crystallography and NMR. In particular, we show that solid-state NMR has the ability to reveal effects caused by ligand binding which are more easily relatable to structural and dynamical alterations that impact the stability of macromolecular complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Organophotoredox Strategy to Difluoroalkyl Bicycloalkane (CF2&#8208;BCA) Hybrid Bioisosteres
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of difluoroalkyl bicycloalkane hybrid bioisostere (CF2&#8208;BCA) is reported. These molecules merge the structural and biological benefits of two well&#8208;established bioisosteres, profiling their utilization under drug discovery programs.







Abstract
Here, we report a general approach to the synthesis of the difluoroalkyl bicycloalkanes (CF2&#8208;BCAs), as structural surrogates of aryl ketones and ethers. The chemistry is driven by a dihydrobenzoacridine photocatalyst, that engages in a catalytic electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complex, or directly reduces the fluorinated substrate. These two convergent manifolds lead to the generation of the R&#8208;CF2 radical, that reacts with the [1.1.1]&#8208; or [3.1.1.]&#8208;propellane. The method is extremely general, and extendable to complex bioactive molecules (30 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). The structural features of the CF2&#8208;BCP hybrid bioisostere were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray. Finally, we synthesised a CF2&#8208;BCP analogue of a Leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, replacing the original aryl ether motif. In silico docking studies indicated that this new analogue maintains the same arrangement within the enzyme pocket, profiling the use of the CF2&#8208;BCA hybrid bioisostere in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>Regulation of Redox Molecular Junctions in Covalent Organic Frameworks for H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>

A series of covalent organic frameworks with well&#8208;tuned redox molecular junctions have been prepared and can be successfully applied for H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with furfuryl alcohol photo&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass valorization can not only maximize the energy utilization but also realize the production of value&#8208;added products. Here, a series of COFs (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF and TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with regulated redox molecular junctions have been prepared to study H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with furfuryl alcohol (FFA) photo&#8208;oxidation to furoic acid (FA). The FA generation efficiency of Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF was found to be 575&#8197;mM&#8201;g&#8722;1 (conversion &#8776;100&#8201;% and selectivity &gt;99&#8201;%) and the H2O2 production rate can reach up to 187&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF, TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF and its monomers. As shown by theoretical calculations, the covalent coupling of the Cu cluster and the thiazole group can promote charge transfer, substrate activation and FFA dehydrogenation, thus boosting both the kinetics of H2O2 production and FFA photo&#8208;oxidation to increase the efficiency. This is the first report about COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass valorization, which might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline catalysts in this field.

         <title>Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylotrophic bacteria utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their metabolism: Studies with two bacterial lanthanide&#8208;using strains demonstrate that the trivalent radioactive 5&#8201;f elements americium and curium can support growth. Also, catalytic activity of the lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases with actinides is shown. For the first time it is established that actinides can play a beneficial role in biological metabolism.







Abstract
Certain f&#8208;block elements&#8212;the lanthanides&#8212;have biological relevance in the context of methylotrophic bacteria. The respective strains incorporate these 4&#8201;f elements into the active site of one of their key metabolic enzymes, a lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase. In this study, we investigated whether actinides, the radioactive 5&#8201;f elements, can replace the essential 4&#8201;f elements in lanthanide&#8208;dependent bacterial metabolism. Growth studies with Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV and the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 &#916;mxaF mutant demonstrate that americium and curium support growth in the absence of lanthanides. Moreover, strain SolV favors these actinides over late lanthanides when presented with a mixture of equal amounts of lanthanides together with americium and curium. Our combined in vivo and in vitro results establish that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their one&#8208;carbon metabolism if they possess the correct size and a +III oxidation state.

         <title>Molecular Exclusion Separation of 1&#8208;Butene Isomers by a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With tailored pore environments, ultramicroporous MOF (MET&#8208;Fe) realized the molecular exclusion separation of 1&#8208;butene isomers. High&#8208;purity isobutene was obtained directly from a gas mixture, and large amounts of n&#8208;butene were collected in a mild regeneration process. Moreover, the high robustness endowed the adsorbent with excellent durability and unaffected separation performance in humidity.







Abstract
Separating n&#8208;butene and i&#8208;butene by adsorption is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but designing porous adsorbents that distinguish the subtle differences between the isomers is extremely challenging. Currently, adsorbents that can sieve 1&#8208;butene isomers and are stable enough to withstand humid gas mixtures are largely unmet. Herein, we propose a robust ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MET&#8208;Fe) that can separate 1&#8208;butene isomers through molecular exclusion. The pore aperture size (4.6&#8197;&#197;) precisely matches the kinetic diameters of the isomers, as verified by static and kinetic adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, easy regeneration, and remarkable reusability of MET&#8208;Fe in both dry and humid conditions. With its high selectivity, large breakthrough capacity, and outstanding stability, MET&#8208;Fe provides an ideal platform for industrial butene isomers separation.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenative Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination Using a Chiral Pyridine&#8208;Derived Half&#8208;Sandwich Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently challenging enantioselective direct reductive amination reaction under mild and operationally simple transfer hydrogenative conditions was developed using a rationally designed, chiral pyridine&#8208;derived half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalyst. The reaction was compatible with various functional groups and coordinative heterocycles.







Abstract
Chiral amines are broadly used compounds in pharmaceutical industry and organic synthesis, and reductive amination reactions have been the most appreciated methods for their syntheses. However, one&#8208;step transfer hydrogenative direct asymmetric reductive amination (THDARA) that could expand the scope, simplify the operation and eliminate the use of additives has been challenging. In this work, based on the Xiao's racemic transfer hydrogenative reductive amination in 2010 and our recent work in novel chiral pyridine ligands, chiral half&#8208;sandwich iridium catalysts were rationally designed and synthesized. Using the optimized catalyst and azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine as the hydrogen source, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;chiral (hetero)aryl amines, including various polar functional groups and heterocycles, were prepared in generally high yield and enantioselectivity under mild and operationally simple conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the catalytically active Ir&#8722;H species and the key hydride transfer step supported the chiral pyridine&#8208;induced stereospecific generation of the iridium center, and the enantioselection by taming the highly flexible key transition structure with multiple attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions. This work introduced a type of effective chiral catalysts for simplified approach to medicinally important chiral amines, as well as a rare example of robust enantioselective transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Chitin&#8208; and Streptavidin&#8208;Mediated Affinity Purification Systems: A Screening Platform for Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protein purification system, designated CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification), has been developed for enzyme library screening. The system utilizes chitin powder as a chromatography matrix to purify Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II fusion proteins. Given the cost of chitin and the availability of Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II, the CSAP system offers a powerful platform for the screening of purified proteins.







Abstract
Affinity purification of recombinant proteins is an essential technique in biotechnology. However, current affinity purification methods are very cost&#8208;intensive, and this imposes limits on versatile use of affinity purification for obtaining purified proteins for a variety of applications. To overcome this problem, we developed a new affinity purification system which we call CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification) for low&#8208;cost purification of Strep&#8208;tag&#8197;II fusion proteins. The CSAP system is designed to utilize commercially available chitin powder as a chromatography matrix, thereby significantly improving the cost&#8208;efficiency of protein affinity purification. We investigated the CSAP system for protein screening in 96&#8208;well format as a demonstration. Through the screening of 96&#8197;types of purified hemoproteins, several proteins capable of the catalytic diastereodivergent synthesis of cyclopropanes were identified as candidates for an abiotic carbene transfer reaction.

         <title>Modeling the Enzyme Specificity by Molecular Cages through Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages with Zn&#8208;, Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;metal clusters exhibited different electronic structures which dictated the reactive oxygen species evolution. Three photoreactions were achieved by the three cages, respectively, because of the distinct charge transfer and energy transfer pathways. This work demonstrated a rare case that a supramolecular photocatalyst exhibited reaction specificity.







Abstract
Mimicking the active site and the substrate binding cavity of the enzyme to achieve specificity in catalytic reactions is an essential challenge. Herein, porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic cavities and tunable metal centers have proved the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating pathways as evidenced by multiple photo&#8208;induced oxidations. Remarkably, in the presence of the Zn4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center, PCC converted dioxygen molecules from triplet to singlet excitons, whereas the Ni4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center promoted the efficient dissociation of electrons and holes to conduct electron transfer towards substrates. Accordingly, the distinct ROS generation behavior of PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn and PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni enables the conversion of O2 to 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;, respectively. In contrast, the Co4&#8208;&#956;4&#8208;O center combined the 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; together to generate carbonyl radicals, which in turn reacted with the oxygen molecules. Harnessing the three oxygen activation pathways, PCC&#8208;6&#8208;M (M=Zn/Ni/Co) display specific catalytic activities in thioanisole oxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Zn), benzylamine coupling (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Ni), and aldehyde autoxidation (PCC&#8208;6&#8208;Co). This work not only provides fundamental insights into the regulation of ROS generation by a supramolecular catalyst but also demonstrates a rare example of achieving reaction specificity through mimicking natural enzymes by PCCs.

         <title>High&#8208;entropy Electrolyte Enables High Reversibility and Long Lifespan for Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with the Mg2+&#8208;2DME&#8208;Otf&#8722;&#8208;Li+&#8208;DME&#8208;TMP solvation structure was built by introducing LiOTf and TMP to conventional Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolyte. The electrolyte successfully promoted the desolvation process and formed a Mg2+&#8208;conductive interfacial layer. In the presence of the high&#8208;entropy electrolyte, a Mg||Cu cell exhibited a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;%, and a Mg||Mo6S8 full cell delivered stable cycling performance.







Abstract
The stable cycling of Mg&#8208;metal anodes is limited by several problems, including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and passivation at the Mg surface. In this study, we present a high&#8208;entropy electrolyte composed of lithium triflate (LiOTf) and trimethyl phosphate (TMP) co&#8208;added to magnesium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2/1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of Mg&#8208;metal anodes. The as&#8208;formed high&#8208;entropy Mg2+&#8208;2DME&#8208;OTf&#8722;&#8208;Li+&#8208;DME&#8208;TMP solvation structure effectively reduced the Mg2+&#8208;DME interaction in comparison with that observed in traditional Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolytes, thereby preventing the formation of insulating components on the Mg&#8208;metal anode and promoting its electrochemical kinetics and cycling stability. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the high&#8208;entropy solvation structure brought OTf&#8722; and TMP to the surface of the Mg&#8208;metal anode and promoted the formation of a Mg3(PO4)2&#8208;rich interfacial layer, which is beneficial for enhancing Mg2+ conductivity. Consequently, the Mg&#8208;metal anode achieved excellent reversibility with a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;% and low voltage hysteresis. This study provides new insights into the design of electrolytes for Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

A facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis method at atmospheric pressure is employed to synthesize nanoparticles (NPs) with Pd&#8208;enriched high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) core and Pt&#8208;enriched HEA shell in a pure phase of face&#8208;centred cubic structure. The obtained PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs exhibit 2874 and 3386&#8197;mA&#8201;mg(Pd+Pt)&#8722;1 for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), respectively.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) have aroused great interest globally with their unique electrochemical, catalytic, and mechanical properties, as well as diverse activity and multielement tunability for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis method at atmospheric pressure is employed to synthesize Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell NPs with a single phase of face&#8208;centred cubic structure. Interestingly, the lattice of both Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell enlarge during the formation process of HEA, with tensile strains included in the core and shell of HEA. The as&#8208;obtained PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The specific (mass) activity of PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs for MOR is 4.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (2874&#8197;mA&#8201;mg(Pd+Pt)&#8722;1), about 1.7 (5.9) and 1.5 (4.8) times higher than that of commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Additional to high&#8208;entropy effect, Pt sites and Pd sites on the interface of the HEA act synergistically to facilitate the multi&#8208;step process towards EOR. This study offers a promising way to find a feasible route for scalable HEA manufacturing with promising applications.

         <title>A Chemical Proteomic Strategy Reveals Inhibitors of Lipoate Salvage in Bacteria and Parasites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct from humans, lipoic acid (LA) salvage by lipoate protein ligase (LPL) is an essential scavenging pathway for auxotrophic bacteria and parasites. Probes as LA&#8208;mimics were designed and shown to label LA&#8208;dependent proteins in living cells on lysines. This tool enabled us to perform competitive screens in order to identify two cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors with activity against P.&#8197;falciparum in erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of novel anti&#8208;infectives requires unprecedented strategies targeting pathways which are solely present in pathogens but absent in humans. Following this principle, we developed inhibitors of lipoic acid (LA) salvage, a crucial pathway for the survival of LA auxotrophic bacteria and parasites but non&#8208;essential in human cells. An LA&#8208;based probe was selectively transferred onto substrate proteins via lipoate protein ligase (LPL) in intact cells, and their binding sites were determined by mass spectrometry. Probe labeling served as a proxy of LPL activity, enabling in situ screenings for cell&#8208;permeable LPL inhibitors. Profiling a focused compound library revealed two substrate analogs (LAMe and C3) as inhibitors, which were further validated by binding studies and co&#8208;crystallography. Importantly, LAMe exhibited low toxicity in human cells and achieved killing of Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes with an EC50 value of 15&#8197;&#956;M, making it the most effective LPL inhibitor reported to date.

         <title>CuCoO2 Nanoparticles as a Nanoprotease for Selective Proteolysis with High Efficiency at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoproteases usually contain tetravalent metal ions and function at high temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C). CuCoO2 nanoparticles selectively hydrolyze peptide bonds with hydrophobic residues at room temperature with very good reusability. The high Lewis acidity of Co3+ and the low valence of Cu+ are important for the high protease activity. The findings will aid the design of new efficient nanoproteases from low&#8208;valent metal oxide nanoparticles.







Abstract
Many nanoproteases contain tetravalent metal ions and catalyze peptide&#8208;bond hydrolysis only at high temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we report a new and effective strategy to explore nanoproteases from nanoparticles containing low valent metal ions. We found that flower&#8208;like CuCoO2 nanoparticles (CuCoO2 NPs) containing low valent Cu+ possessed excellent catalytic activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bonds with hydrophobic residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature. CuCoO2 NPs exhibited excellent stability and had great reusability. CuCoO2 NPs also hydrolyzed heat&#8208;denatured and surfactant&#8208;denatured BSA. Mechanism analysis revealed that the high Lewis acidity of Co3+ and the low valence of Cu+ were both essential for the high protease activity of CuCoO2 NPs. The flower&#8208;like structure of CuCoO2 NPs and the strong nucleophilicity of Cu+&#8208;bound hydroxyl endow them with excellent catalytic performance. The findings open a new way for the design and discovery of high&#8208;efficiency nanoproteases.

         <title>Construction of Asymmetrical Dual Jahn&#8211;Teller Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric dual Jahn&#8211;Teller site is assembled to match the CO2 and reductive intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and the intermediates for accurate modulation of photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) expresses great attraction to convert useless greenhouse gas into valuable chemical feedstock. However, the weak interactions between catalytic sites and PCR intermediates constrains the PCR activity and selectivity. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to match the intermediates due to the maximum orbital overlap of catalytic sites and C1 intermediates by establishing dual Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) sites, in which, the strongly asymmetric J&#8211;T sites can break the nonpolar CO2 molecules and self&#8208;adapt the different structure of C1 intermediates. Taking cobalt carbonate hydroxide as an example, the weakly symmetric dual cobalt (Co2) dual J&#8211;T sites, weakly asymmetric Fe&amp;Co sites and strongly asymmetric Cu&amp;Co sites were assembled. After illumination, the interaction between dual J&#8211;T sites and the CO2 molecules enhances J&#8211;T distortion, which further modulates the PCR activity and selectivity. As a result, the Cu&amp;Co sites exhibited CO yield of 8137.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1, about 2.3&#8208;fold and 4.2&#8208;fold higher than that of the Fe&amp;Co and Co2 sites within 5&#8208;hour photoreaction, respectively. In addition, the selectivity achieved as high as 92.62&#8201;% than Fe&amp;Co (88.67&#8201;%) and Co2 sites (55.33&#8201;%). This work provides a novel design concept for the construction of dual J&#8211;T sites to regulate the catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Dinitrogen Functionalization with Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Disulfide Giving Symmetric and Unsymmetric Hydrazido Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>

Carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide reacted with an end&#8208;on bridging dinitrogen titanium/potassium complex though insertion into the Ti&#8722;NN bonds to form new nitrogen&#8208;carbon bonds. Carboxylation with CO2 afforded a symmetric dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. On the other hand, stepwise C&#8722;N bond formation proceeded at coordinated N2 to generated an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating with CS2 and then CO2.







Abstract
Here we show that a tridentate bis(aryloxide)anilide&#8208;ligated titanium/potassium scaffold promotes functionalization of coordinated N2 with CO2 and CS2 through formation of N&#8722;C bonds. Treatment of a naphthalene complex with N2 gave an end&#8208;on bridging dinitrogen complex featuring a [Ti2K2N2] core. The dinitrogen complex underwent insertion of CO2 into each Ti&#8722;NN bond to afford an N,N&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. Stepwise nitrogen&#8208;carbon bond formation at coordinated N2 proceeded to afford an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating the dinitrogen complex with CS2 and CO2. Addition of Me3SiCl to the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex resulted in partial silylation of the carboxylate groups but did not lead to removal of the functionalized N2 unit from the metal centers. However, reduction of the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex with potassium naphthalenide afforded an oxo&#8208;bridged dinuclear complex along with release of free potassium cyanate.

         <title>Deuterated TEKPol Biradicals and the Spin&#8208;Diffusion Barrier in MAS DNP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic nuclear polarization NMR of a series of deuterated and fluorinated TEKPol biradicals allows the elucidation of the hyperpolarization transfer pathway. This knowledge has enabled the design of a new polarization agent, NaphPol, which is the most efficient biradical in organic solvents to date.







Abstract
The sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy is considerably enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In DNP polarization is transferred from unpaired electrons of a polarizing agent to nearby proton spins. In solids, this transfer is followed by the transport of hyperpolarization to the bulk via 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion. The efficiency of these steps is critical to obtain high sensitivity gains, but the pathways for polarization transfer in the region near the unpaired electron spins are unclear. Here we report a series of seven deuterated and one fluorinated TEKPol biradicals to probe the effect of deprotonation on MAS DNP at 9.4&#8197;T. The experimental results are interpreted with numerical simulations, and our findings support that strong hyperfine couplings to nearby protons determine high transfer rates across the spin diffusion barrier to achieve short build&#8208;up times and high enhancements. Specifically, 1H DNP build&#8208;up times increase substantially with TEKPol isotopologues that have fewer hydrogen atoms in the phenyl rings, suggesting that these protons play a crucial role transferring the polarization to the bulk. Based on this new understanding, we have designed a new biradical, NaphPol, which yields significantly increased NMR sensitivity, making it the best performing DNP polarizing agent in organic solvents to date.

         <title>Rechargeable Biomass Battery for Electricity Storage/generation and Concurrent Valuable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable biomass battery was designed to integrate electricity storage/generation and electrosynthesis of useful chemicals from furfural in one system. By electrocatalyst (Rh1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy) and cathode redox pair (Co0.2Ni0.8(OH)2) design, the battery produces furfuryl alcohol in charging process and produces furoic acid in discharging process, reaching a high open circuit voltage of 1.29&#8197;V and power density of 107&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The development of a rechargeable battery that can produce valuable chemicals in both electricity storage and generation processes holds great promise for increasing the electron economy and economic value. However, this battery has yet to be explored. Herein, we report a biomass flow battery that generates electricity while producing furoic acid, and store electricity while yielding furfuryl alcohol. The battery is composed of a rhodium&#8208;copper (Rh1Cu) single&#8208;atom alloy as anode, a cobalt&#8208;doped nickel hydroxide (Co0.2Ni0.8(OH)2) as cathode, and furfural&#8208;containing anolyte. In a full battery evaluation, this battery displays an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.29&#8197;V and a peak power density up to 107&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most catalysis&#8208;battery hybrid systems. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that this battery produces 1&#8197;kg furoic acid with 0.78&#8197;kWh electricity output, and yields 0.62&#8197;kg furfuryl alcohol when 1&#8197;kWh electricity is stored. This work may shed light on the design of rechargeable batteries with value&#8208;added functionality such as chemicals production.

A stepped&#8208;amorphization strategy involving progressive composition, time, and temperature regulations is proposed to break the Li+ conduction bottleneck of the LiI&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropionitrile (LiI&#8208;HPN) hybrid system, to construct a small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with Li+ conductor&#8208;type and improved conductivity, which is successfully operated in lithium metal batteries to deliver considerable compatibility and stability.







Abstract
Integrating the advantages of both inorganic ceramic and organic polymer solid&#8208;state electrolytes, small&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state electrolytes represented by LiI&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropionitrile (LiI&#8208;HPN) inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems possess good interfacial compatibility and high modulus. However, their lack of intrinsic Li+ conduction ability hinders potential application in lithium metal batteries until now, despite containing LiI phase composition. Herein, inspired by evolution tendency of ionic conduction behaviors together with first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a stepped&#8208;amorphization strategy to break the Li+ conduction bottleneck of LiI&#8208;HPN. It involves three progressive steps of composition (LiI&#8208;content increasing), time (long&#8208;time standing), and temperature (high&#8208;temperature melting) regulations, to essentially construct a small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with intensified amorphous degree, which realizes efficient conversion from an I&#8722; to Li+ conductor and improved conductivity. As a proof, the stepped&#8208;optimized LiI&#8208;HPN is successfully operated in lithium metal batteries cooperated with Li4Ti5O12 cathode to deliver considerable compatibility and stability over 250&#8197;cycles. This work not only clarifies the ionic conduction mechanisms of LiI&#8208;HPN inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid systems, but also provides a reasonable strategy to broaden the application scenarios of highly compatible small&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles with Chlorodiazirines: Synthetic Methodology and Thermal Hazard Assessment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that pyridinium and quinolinium salts can be accessed by the insertion of a single C&#8208;atom from an arylchlorodiazirine into the parent N&#8208;alkyl pyrrole or indole. The azinium products of ring expansion are activated towards oxygenation and hydrogenation, expediting further structural diversification. Safer methods for the use of diazirines as carbene precursors have been developed with insight from differential scanning calorimetry.

We demonstrate that arylchlorodiazirines serve as photo&#8208;activated halocarbene precursors for the selective one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of N&#8208;substituted pyrroles and indoles to the corresponding pyridinium and quinolinium salts. Preliminary investigations indicate that the same strategy also enables the conversion of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles to pyrimidinium salts. The N&#8208;substituent of the substrate plays an essential role in: (1) increasing substrate scope by preventing product degradation, (2) enhancing yields by suppressing co&#8208;product inhibition, and (3) activating the azinium products towards subsequent synthetic manipulations. This latter point is illustrated by subjecting the quinolinium salts to four complementary partial reductions, which provide concise access to ring&#8208;expanded products with different degrees of increased C(sp3) character. Thermal analysis of the diazirines by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides detailed insight into their energetic properties, and highlights the safety benefits of photolyzing&#8212;rather than thermolyzing&#8212;these reagents.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that pyridinium and quinolinium salts can be accessed by the insertion of a single C-atom from an arylchlorodiazirine into the parent &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl pyrrole or indole. The azinium products of ring expansion are activated towards oxygenation and hydrogenation, expediting further structural diversification. Safer methods for the use of diazirines as carbene precursors have been developed with insight from differential scanning calorimetry.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>

         <dc:description>
The photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts, enabled by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer complex, has been developed. This strategy allows access to various carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceuticals via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals in the absence of a transition metal (TM) and photocatalyst (PC).







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods involving boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those for carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals by photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids by radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are generated by single&#8208;electron transfer of the photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>

An organic small&#8208;molecule octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate (OF&#8208;HDDA) is introduced to in situ crosslink forming a polymer (POF&#8208;HDDA), which anchors uncoordinated lead ions and prevents lead leakage from water and oxygen invasion, and concurrently improves the long&#8208;term stability of the corresponding devices.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the &#8722;CF2&#8722; hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer&#8208;incorporated devices are 24.76&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 20.66&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). More importantly, the storage stability, thermal stability, and operational stability have been significantly improved.

         <title>An Extracellular miRNA&#8208;Responsive Artificial Receptor via Dynamic DNA Nano&#8208;assembly for Biomarker&#8208;Driven Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) as a biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic nanodevice for liver injury repair has been developed. The miRNA&#8208;CDR is highly modular, programmable, and versatile, allowing us to customize sense&#8208;and&#8208;respond programs to diverse user&#8208;defined miRNA inputs with a tunable dynamic range, eliciting orthogonal activation of different receptor tyrosine kinases as signaling outputs, which is ultimately used for miRNA biomarker&#8208;driven acute liver injury repair.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various diseases. However, there is currently a lack of molecular strategies that can effectively use disease&#8208;associated extracellular miRNAs as input signals to drive therapeutic functions. Herein, we present a modular and programmable miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) capable of biomarker&#8208;driven therapy. By grafting a miRNA&#8208;responsive DNA nanodevice on a natural membrane receptor via aptamer anchoring, miRNA&#8208;CDR can sense extracellular miRNA levels and autonomously induce dimerization&#8208;mediated receptor activation via the complementary&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction&#8208;induced dynamic DNA assembly. The sequence programmability of miRNA&#8208;CDR allows it to sense and respond to a user&#8208;defined miRNA with tunable sensitivity. Moreover, the miRNA&#8208;CDR is versatile and customizable to reprogram desirable signaling output via adapting a designated receptor, such as MET and FGFR1. Using a mouse model of drug&#8208;induced acute liver injury (DILI), we demonstrate the functionality of a designer miRNA&#8208;CDR in rewiring the recognition of the DILI&#8208;elevated miR&#8208;122 to promote MET signaling of hepatocytes for biomarker&#8208;driven in situ repair and liver function restoration. Our synthetic miRNA&#8208;CDR platform provides a novel molecular device enabling biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic cellular response, potentially paving the way for improving the precision of cell therapy in regenerative medicine.

(P,C)/(N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated as well as (P,N)&#8208;chelated AuIII &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes readily undergo ring&#8208;opening to give the corresponding &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes by cleavage of the distal &#963;(C&#8722;C) bond. The possible existence of &#963;(C&#8722;C) agostic interactions at AuIII is supported computationally.







Abstract
The possibility for AuIII &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes to undergo ring&#8208;opening and give &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes was interrogated. The transformation was first evidenced within (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, it occurs within hours at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. It was then generalized to other ancillary ligands. With (N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, the rearrangement occurs at room temperature while it proceeds already at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C with a dicationic (P,N)&#8208;chelated complex. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the mechanism of the transformation, a disrotatory electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening. Intrinsic Bond Orbital (IBO) analysis along the reaction profile shows the cleavage of the distal &#963;(CC) bond to give a &#960;&#8208;bonded allyl moiety. Careful inspection of the structure and bonding of cationic &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes support the possible existence of C&#8722;C agostic interactions at AuIII.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Amine Cascade Addition to Diyne&#8208;Ene: Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion utilizing gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular amine cascade addition to diyne&#8208;ene is reported herein, exhibiting good yield and excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
With the well&#8208;documented chemical and biological applications, piperidine and pyridine are among the most important N&#8208;heterocycles, and a new synthetic strategy, especially one with an alternative bond&#8208;forming design, is of general interest. Using the gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular condensation of amine and diyne&#8208;ene, we report herein the first example of enantioselective 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine synthesis through a formal [3+2+1] fashion (up to 95&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;e.e.).

         <title>Living Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Hetero Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts to Give Multifactor&#8208;Controlled and Fast&#8208;Photodegradable Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a hetero Diels&#8211;Alder adduct is reported. Vinyl polymers are produced with control of multiple structural parameters, including alternating sequence and head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity. The photodegradability of the obtained polymers has been thoroughly investigated for the first time.







Abstract
Precise control of multiple structural parameters associated with vinyl polymers is important for producing materials with the desired properties and functions. While the development of living polymerization methods has provided a way to control the various structural parameters of vinyl polymers, the concomitant control of their sequence and regioregularity remains a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, herein, we report the living cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of hetero Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The scalable and modular synthesis of the cyclic monomers was achieved by a one&#8208;step protocol using readily available vinyl precursors. Subsequently, living polymerization of the cyclic monomers was examined, allowing the synthesis of vinyl polymers while controlling multiple factors, including molecular weight, dispersity, alternating sequence, head&#8208;to&#8208;head regioregularity, and end&#8208;group functionality. The living characteristics of the developed method were further demonstrated by block copolymerization. The synthesized vinyl polymers exhibited unique thermal properties and underwent fast photodegradation even under sunlight.

A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described. This protocol proceeds via a migratory insertion of nickel hydride to alkyne followed by a CF2H&#8208;coupling, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and exclusive regioselectivity. The mild condition applies to a wide array of aliphatic and aryl alkynes with good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies are presented to support the proposed pathway.

         <title>A Multifunctional Liquid Crystal as Hole Transport Layer Additive Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>

Incorporation of a multifunctional liquid crystal (LQ) into (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#8208;based hole transport layer (HTL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can strongly enhance hot carriers extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, reducing charge&#8208;carrier recombination in device. Moreover, LQ can efficiently prevent the Li ions migration and agglomeration of Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) HTL dopant through chemical interaction. Using this approach, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li&#8208;TFSI) has been identified as the most used and effective p&#8208;dopant for hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI in HTL negatively impact PSCs performance and stability. Herein, we report an effective strategy for adding a liquid crystal organic small molecule (LQ) into Li&#8208;TFSI doped (2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208; spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) HTL. It was found that the introduction of LQ into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTL can efficiently enhance the charge carrier extraction and transportation in device, which can strongly retard the charge carrier recombination in device. Consequently, the PSCs efficiency is significantly enhanced to 24.42&#8201;% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD+LQ) from 21.03&#8201;% (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD). The chemical coordination between LQ and Li&#8208;TFSI can strongly confine Li+ ions migration and agglomeration of Li&#8208;TFSI, thus, achieving the enhanced device stability. Only a 9&#8201;% efficiency degradation is observed for un&#8208;encapsulated device prepared with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and LQ after 1700&#8197;h under air environment, while the efficiency drops by 30&#8201;% for the reference device. This work provides an effective strategy for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs, and gives some important insights for understanding intrinsic hot carriers dynamics for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

The asymmetric &#947;&#8208;additions of 1&#8208;alkynyl ketimines under dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalysis have been developed, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino allenoates with a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee, up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were catalyzed by double chiral Cu catalysts.







Abstract
The skeletons of chiral tetrasubstituted allenes bearing a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter are of importance but still challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective &#947;&#8208;additions of 1&#8208;alkynyl ketimines with dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalysis under mild conditions, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino allenoates bearing a vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Importantly, the stereodivergent synthesis of the products was realized by the asymmetric &#947;&#8208;addition reaction and the Grignard reagent promoted epimerization. Moreover, the dual&#8208;copper&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;addition reactions were smoothly applied to a gram&#8208;scale reaction and adopted to introduce chiral tetrasubstituted allenyl moieties into bioactive molecules.

     alt="Enantio- and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Tetrasubstituted &#945;-Amino Allenoates Bearing a Vicinal All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenter with Dual-Copper-Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric &#947;-additions of 1-alkynyl ketimines under dual-copper-catalysis have been developed, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;-amino allenoates with a vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, up to &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the asymmetric &#947;-addition reactions were catalyzed by double chiral Cu catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeletons of chiral tetrasubstituted allenes bearing a vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenter are of importance but still challenging to synthesize. Herein, we report enantio- and diastereoselective &#947;-additions of 1-alkynyl ketimines with dual-copper-catalysis under mild conditions, affording chiral tetrasubstituted &#945;-amino allenoates bearing a vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) and diastereoselectivities (up to &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt;). Importantly, the stereodivergent synthesis of the products was realized by the asymmetric &#947;-addition reaction and the Grignard reagent promoted epimerization. Moreover, the dual-copper-catalyzed &#947;-addition reactions were smoothly applied to a gram-scale reaction and adopted to introduce chiral tetrasubstituted allenyl moieties into bioactive molecules. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the asymmetric &#947;-addition reactions were catalyzed by double chiral copper catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum Metallacycle&#8208;Based Molecular Recognition: Establishment and Application in Spontaneous Formation of a [2]Rotaxane with Light&#8208;Harvesting Property</title>

We report a platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system and its application in efficient construction of a [2]rotaxane with sequential light&#8208;harvesting property.







Abstract
Macrocyclic molecule&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems, which provide contributions for the design and construction of functional supramolecular structures, have gained increasing attention in recent years. In particular, platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems provide opportunities for chemical scientists to prepare novel materials with various functions and structures due to the well&#8208;defined shapes and cavity sizes of platinum(II) metallacycles. However, the research on platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems has been given little attention. In this article, we demonstrate the host&#8211;guest complexation between a platinum(II) metallacycle and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule, naphthalene. Taking advantage of metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest interactions and the dynamic property of reversible Pt coordination bonds, a [2]rotaxane is efficiently prepared by employing a template&#8208;directed clipping procedure. The [2]rotaxane is further applied to the fabrication of an efficient light&#8208;harvesting system with multi&#8208;step energy transfer process. This work comprises an important supplement to macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems and demonstrates a strategy for efficient production of well&#8208;defined mechanically interlocked molecules with practical values.

         <title>Going Beyond Silver in Ethylene Epoxidation with First&#8208;Principles Catalyst Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using computational screening of the periodic table for ethylene epoxidation catalysts, Ag/CuPb, Ag/CuCd, and Ag/CuTl were identified as superior catalysts. The inclusion of surface oxidation, side reactions and epoxide decomposition is shown to be paramount to avoid erroneous predictions. The predicted catalysts were synthesised, characterised and tested, confirming the predictions.







Abstract
Ethylene epoxidation is industrially and commercially one of the most important selective oxidations. Silver catalysts have been state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for decades, their efficiency steadily improving with empirical discoveries of dopants and co&#8208;catalysts. Herein, we perform a computational screening of the metals in the periodic table, identify prospective superior catalysts and experimentally demonstrate that Ag/CuPb, Ag/CuCd and Ag/CuTl outperform the pure&#8208;Ag catalysts, while they still confer an easily scalable synthesis protocol. Furthermore, we show that to harness the potential of computationally&#8208;led discovery of catalysts fully, it is essential to include the relevant in situ conditions e.g., surface oxidation, parasitic side reactions and ethylene epoxide decomposition, as neglecting such effects leads to erroneous predictions. We combine ab initio calculations, scaling relations, and rigorous reactor microkinetic modelling, which goes beyond conventional simplified steady&#8208;state or rate&#8208;determining modelling on immutable catalyst surfaces. The modelling insights have enabled us to both synthesise novel catalysts and theoretically understand experimental findings, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principles simulations and industrial applications. We show that the computational catalyst design can be easily extended to include larger reaction networks and other effects, such as surface oxidations. The feasibility was confirmed by experimental agreement.

         <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Superoxide&#8208;Triggered Nanoreporters for Crosstalk&#8208;Free Dual Fluorescence/Chemiluminescence Imaging and Urinalysis in Living Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters with superoxide anion&#8208;triggered luminescent turn&#8208;on response and nanostructure decomposition are synthesized. The conversion from nanoparticles to renal clearable fragments allows for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging of peritonitis, drug induced hepatoxicity and in vitro urinalysis.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging has been recognized as a valuable tool for ultrasensitive detection of physio&#8208;pathological events through elimination of background autofluorescence. However, most chemiluminescent nanoprobes suffer from shallow imaging depths and slow clearance from living bodies, which impede their use in clinical settings. We herein report size&#8208;transformable nanoreporters (ADN1 and ADN2) that could be activated at disease site by superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;) to trigger nanostructure disassembly into renal excretable fluorescent fragments as well as chemiluminescence turn&#8208;on for crosstalk&#8208;free duplex chemo&#8208;fluorescence imaging and in vitro urinalysis. In peritonitis mouse model, we demonstrate that the representative nanoreporter ADN1 spontaneously accumulates at the disrupted peritoneum and is cleaved by upregulated O2&#8901;&#8722; to initiate depolymerization and result in red chemiluminescence at 620&#8197;nm, enabling sensitive detection of peritonitis at least 19&#8197;h earlier than gold standard histological assays. Additionally, the incorporation of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye into ADN1 results in ADN2 exhibiting intense and red&#8208;shifted chemiluminescence at &#8776;800&#8197;nm, which permits early detection of deeply seated diseases such as drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity. This study thus showcases a modular design strategy that is not only applicable to developing versatile chemiluminescent nanoprobes with switchable pharmacokinetics for early disease diagnosis, but also promising for future clinical translations.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte with a wide liquidus range is proposed for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Its all&#8208;anion Li+ solvation and phase&#8208;nano&#8208;segregation solution structure are sustained at low temperatures, which, together with a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic compounds on lithium metal anodes, enable stable cycling of LMBs with high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries but suffers from low stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency and dendritic growth particularly at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, a poorly&#8208;flammable, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte with a wide liquidus range extending well below 0&#8201;&#176;C is proposed for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries. Its all&#8208;anion Li+ solvation and phase&#8208;nano&#8208;segregation solution structure are sustained at low temperatures, which, together with a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic compounds, enable dendrite&#8208;free operation of lithium metal anodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.9&#8201;%. As a result, lithium metal batteries coupling thin lithium metal anodes (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathodes (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) retain 70&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These results, as a proof of concept, demonstrate the applicability of locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries.

Its all-anion Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation and phase-nano-segregation solution structure are sustained at low temperatures, which, together with a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic compounds, enable dendrite-free operation of lithium metal anodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.9&#8201;%. As a result, lithium metal batteries coupling thin lithium metal anodes (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and high-loading LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) retain 70&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These results, as a proof of concept, demonstrate the applicability of locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes for low-temperature lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metallaphotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Using Alcohols as Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective coupling of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and aryl bromides, using Ni/photoredox catalysis and alcohols as reducing agents, is reported. This protocol offers modular access to enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant precursors, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. The alcohol&#8208;based approach holds potential as a general platform for enantioselective cross&#8208;electrophile couplings.







Abstract
The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) represents a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation. However, controlling the enantioselectivity in these processes remains a challenge. Here, we report an unprecedented enantioselective XEC of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with aryl bromides, enabled by alcohols as reducing agents via Ni/photoredox catalysis. This mechanistically distinct approach exploits the ability of photocatalytically generated &#945;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals to convert alkyl electrophiles to the corresponding alkyl radicals that are then enantioselectively coupled with aryl bromides. The readily scalable protocol allows modular access to valuable enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant and inexpensive precursors, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies rationalize the versatility of this alcohol&#8208;based reactivity for radical generation and subsequent asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. We expect that this alcohol&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling will render a general platform for the development of appealing yet challenging enantioselective XECs.

         <title>Cesium Methylammonium Lead Iodide (CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3) Nanocrystals with Wide Range Cation Composition Tuning and Enhanced Thermal Stability of the Perovskite Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite phase&#8208;pure mixed&#8208;cation CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals were obtained by post&#8208;synthesis cation exchange between CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals at room temperature. The CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals exhibit composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL) with their thermal stability that is enhanced compared to the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals.







Abstract
Cesium methylammonium lead iodide (CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3) nanocrystals were obtained with a wide range of A&#8208;site Cs&#8208;MA compositions by post&#8208;synthetic, room temperature cation exchange between CsPbI3 nanocrystals and MAPbI3 nanocrystals. The alloyed CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals retain their photoactive perovskite phase with incorporated Cs content, x, as high as 0.74 and the expected composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL). Excess methylammonium oleate from the reaction mixture in the MAPbI3 nanocrystal dispersions was necessary to obtain fast Cs&#8208;MA cation exchange. The phase transformation and degradation kinetics of films of CsxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 nanocrystals were measured and modeled using an Avrami expression. The transformation kinetics were significantly slower than those of the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals, with Avrami rate constants, k, at least an order of magnitude smaller. These results affirm that A&#8208;site cation alloying is a promising strategy for stabilizing iodide&#8208;based perovskites.

         <title>Organopotassium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions is described. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silicon source, various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes were prepared from methylarenes precursors. Mechanistic studies demonstrate the involvement of organopotassium reagents, including synthetically&#8208;elusive tert&#8208;butylpotassium.







Abstract
Benzylsilanes have found increasing applications in organic synthesis as bench&#8208;stable synthetic intermediates, yet are mostly produced by stoichiometric procedures. Catalytic alternatives based on the atom&#8208;economical silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds remain scarcely available as specialized directing groups and catalytic systems are needed to outcompete the kinetically&#8208;favored silylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we describe the first general and catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silicon source. The high activity and selectivity of the catalytic system, exemplified by the preparation of various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes, originates from the facile generation of organopotassium reagents, including tert&#8208;butylpotassium.

         <title>Revealing Capacity Degradation of Ge Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Triggered by Interfacial LiH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ge anode failure mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is analyzed. There is a clear correlation between Ge electrode failure and the interfacial evolution of LiH. It is revealed that Li4Ge2H, as a new species derived from LiH, is the culprit of Ge anode degradation.







Abstract
The Germanium (Ge), as a fast&#8208;charging and high specific capacity (1568&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) alloy anode, is greatly hampered in practical application by poor cyclability. To date, the understanding of cycling performance degradation remains elusive. This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li4Ge2H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever&#8208;growing and ever&#8208;insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li4Ge2H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever-growing and ever-insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Remote Borylation of Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric remote borylation of alkyl bromides is reported. The application of this migratory borylation was extended to other alkyl electrophiles (alkyl&#8208;X with X=I, Cl, OTs) and aryl halides. Additionally, a gram&#8208;scale reaction could be conducted while further transformation of the borylated products was demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated a radical reaction pathway may be involved.







Abstract
Enantioselective functionalization of racemic alkyl halides is an efficient strategy to assemble complex chiral molecules, but remains one of the biggest challenges in organic chemistry. The distant and selective activation of unreactive C&#8722;H bonds in alkyl halides has received growing interest as it enables rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple building blocks. Here, we reported a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed remote borylation of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8722;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OTs) with pinacolborane (HBpin) and presented a robust approach for the generation of valuable chiral secondary organoboronates from racemic alkyl halides. This migration borylation reaction is compatible with primary, secondary, and tertiary bromides, offering direct access to a broad range of alkylboronates. The extension of this catalytic system to the borylation of aryl halides was also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that this remote borylation involved a radical reaction pathway.

One&#8208;handed helical poly(biarylylacetylene)s (PBAs) bearing axially&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;arylpyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide units with different substituents were synthesized.

Abstract
A series of poly(biarylylacetylene)s (PBAs) bearing axially&#8208;chiral (S)&#8208;and (R)&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide residues with a methoxy, propoxy, or acetyloxy substituent at the 3&#8208;position of the biaryl units was synthesized. All the PBAs formed a preferred&#8208;handed helix, while the helical sense preference was varied depending on the substituents despite the same twist&#8208;sense of the biaryl units. Among them, the propoxy&#8208;bound helical PBA showed an exceptionally high chiral recognition ability as a chiral stationary phase (CSP) for high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and efficiently resolved not only various chiral aromatic alcohols, but also a variety of chiral aliphatic alcohols; the latter still remains difficult to resolve by commercially&#8208;available CSPs in HPLC. Such practically&#8208;useful both handed helical PBA&#8208;based CSPs can be produced from the racemic PBA composed of fully racemic monomer units through deracemization of the biaryl units with a chiral alcohol.

         <title>Adenophorone, An Unprecedented Sesquiterpene from Eupatorium adenophorum: Structural Elucidation, Bioinspired Total Synthesis and Neuroprotective Activity Evaluation</title>

Sesquiterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;adenophorone (1) with an unprecedented tricyclo[4.3.1.05,9]decane skeleton was isolated from Eupatorium adenopharum Spreng. The first bioinspired total synthesis of 1 has been accomplished through a sequential Reformatsky/oxidation/regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydrogenation, subsequent merged MBH&#8211;Tsuji&#8211;Trost cyclization, and an intramolecular Michael addition. The potent neuroprotective activity of 1 is also described.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Adenophorone (1), a caged polycyclic sesquiterpene featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[4.3.1.05,9]decane skeleton, was isolated from Eupatorium adenopharum Spreng. The structure of 1 was unambiguously established by a combination of spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and bioinspired total synthesis. Key synthetic features include a sequential Reformatsky/oxidation/regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydrogenation, and subsequent merged MBH&#8211;Tsuji&#8211;Trost cyclization. The concise synthetic sequence efficiently constructs the bicyclic skeleton of cadinene sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;euptox&#8197;A (2) in 8 steps from commercially available monoterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;carvone (6), with outstanding performance on diastereocontrol. The bioinspired synthesis of 1 was achieved from 2, a plausible biogenetic precursor, via transannular Michael addition. This work provides experimental evidence of our proposed biosynthetic hypothesis of 1. Additionally, compound 1 showed potent neuroprotective activity in H2O2&#8208;treated SH&#8208;SY5Y and PC12 cells.

         <title>Facile Processing of Unsubstituted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Aromatic Polymers through Water&#8208;solubilization Using Aromatic Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic micelles enable the solubilization of virtually insoluble, unsubstituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) in water through non&#8208;covalent encircling. The &#960;CAPs are solubilized as fine bundles within the micelles and can be facilely analyzed by UV/Visible, emission, AFM, and/or SEM analyses. The obtained aqueous solutions are processable into free&#8208;standing &#960;CAP thin films using a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) are central components of functional materials yet suffer from insolubility without multiple covalent substituents on their backbones. We herein disclose a new strategy for the facile processing of unsubstituted heterocyclic &#960;CAPs (i.e., poly(para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;benzobisoxazole) and poly(benzimidazobenzo&#8208;phenanthroline)), independent of the polymer length, via non&#8208;covalent encircling with aromatic micelles, composed of bent aromatic amphiphiles, in water. The UV/Visible studies reveal that the efficiencies of the present encircling method are &#8776;10 to 50&#8208;fold higher than those using conventional amphiphiles under the same conditions. The AFM and SEM analyses of the resultant aqueous polymer composites show that otherwise insoluble &#960;CAPs form fine bundles (e.g., &#8776;1&#8197;nm in thickness) in the tubular aromatic micelles, through efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. In the same way, pristine poly(para&#8208;phenylene) can be dissolved in water, displaying enhanced fluorescence (10&#8208;fold), relative to the polymer solid. Two types of unsubstituted &#960;CAPs are likewise co&#8208;encircled in water, indicated by UV/Visible analysis. Importantly, aqueous processing of the encircled &#960;CAPs into free&#8208;standing single&#8208; or multicomponent films with submicrometer thickness is demonstrated through a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.

         <title>Transformation of Type III to Type II Porous Liquids by Tuning Surface Rigidity of Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating N&#8208;donor molecules on the Rh&#8722;Rh axial sites of insoluble RhMOP, and making it soluble as porous host in bulky ionic liquid, a type&#8197;III porous liquid was transformed into type&#8197;II porous liquids for better catalyzing the cycloaddition of CO2.







Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs), a summation of porous hosts and bulky solvents bestowing permanent cavities, are the prominent emerging materials. Despite great efforts, exploration of porous hosts and bulky solvents is still needed to develop new PL systems. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with discrete molecular architectures can be considered as porous hosts; however, many of them are insoluble entities. Here we report the transformation of type&#8197;III PL to type&#8197;II PLs by tuning the surface rigidity of insoluble MOP, Rh24L24, in a bulky ionic liquid (IL). Functionalization of N&#8208;donor molecules on Rh&#8722;Rh axial sites ensue their solubilization in bulky IL which confer type&#8197;II PLs. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal the bulkiness of IL as per the cage apertures, and the cause of their dissolution as well. The obtained PLs, capturing more CO2 than neat solvent, have depicted higher catalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition compared to individual MOPs and IL.

         <title>The First Enantiomeric Stereogenic Sulfur&#8208;Chiral Organic Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the discovery of the first ferroelectric chiral Rochelle salt more than 100&#8197;years ago, the first pair of stereogenic heteroatom sulfur&#8208;chiral ferroelectric crystals is reported on this study. The findings provide a perspective for the development of heteroatomic chiral ferroelectric crystals with great application prospects.







Abstract
Chiral ferroelectric crystals with intriguing features have attracted great interest and many with point or axial chirality based on the stereocarbon have been successively developed in recent years. However, ferroelectric crystals with stereogenic heteroatomic chirality have never been documented so far. Here, we discover and report a pair of enantiomeric stereogenic sulfur&#8208;chiral single&#8208;component organic ferroelectric crystals, Rs&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (Rs&#8208;tBuSA) and Ss&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (Ss&#8208;tBuSA) through the deep understanding of the chemical design of molecular ferroelectric crystals. Both enantiomers adopt chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 (C2) and exhibit mirror&#8208;image relationships. They undergo high&#8208;temperature 432F2&#8208;type plastic ferroelectric phase transition around 348&#8197;K. The ferroelectricity has been well confirmed by ferroelectric hysteresis loops and domains. Polarized light microscopy records the evolution of the ferroelastic domains, according with the fact that the 432F2&#8208;type phase transition is both ferroelectric and ferroelastic. The very soft characteristics with low elastic modulus and hardness reveals their excellent mechanical flexibility. This finding indicates the first stereosulfur chiral molecular ferroelectric crystals, opening up new fertile ground for exploring molecular ferroelectric crystals with great application prospects.

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Directed Proximity&#8208;Driven Crosslinking Method for Native Peptide Bicyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;directed proximity&#8208;driven crosslinking strategy that is initiated by rapid cysteine labeling followed by proximity&#8208;driven amine acylation enables the construction of peptide bicycles with various ring topologies with high efficiency. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the bicyclization of peptides fused to proteins as well to the M13 phage, paving the way to phage display of novel peptide bicycles.







Abstract
Efficient and site&#8208;specific modification of native peptides and proteins is desirable for synthesizing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates as well as for constructing chemically modified peptide libraries using genetically encoded platforms such as phage display. In particular, there is much interest in efficient multicyclization of native peptides due to the appeals of multicyclic peptides as therapeutics. However, conventional approaches for multicyclic peptide synthesis require orthogonal protecting groups or non&#8208;proteinogenic clickable handles. Herein, we report a cysteine&#8208;directed proximity&#8208;driven strategy for the constructing bicyclic peptides from simple natural peptide precursors. This linear to bicycle transformation initiates with rapid cysteine labeling, which then triggers proximity&#8208;driven amine&#8208;selective cyclization. This bicyclization proceeds rapidly under physiologic conditions, yielding bicyclic peptides with a Cys&#8208;Lys&#8208;Cys, Lys&#8208;Cys&#8208;Lys or N&#8208;terminus&#8208;Cys&#8208;Cys stapling pattern. We demonstrate the utility and power of this strategy by constructing bicyclic peptides fused to proteins as well as to the M13 phage, paving the way to phage display of novel bicyclic peptide libraries.

         <title>Surface Adsorbed Hydroxyl: A Double&#8208;Edged Sword in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction over Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR), surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) are demonstrated to act as a double&#8208;edged sword for selective C2 production. OHad with adsorption well optimized and steered would contribute to the stable C2 production with high selectivity over OD&#8722;Cu for long&#8208;term ECO2RR.







Abstract
Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles (NPs) created via surface structure reconstruction was developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR). With surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) identified during ECO2RR, it is realized that OHad, sterically confined and adsorbed at OD&#8722;Cu by surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm NPs, should be determinative to the multi&#8208;carbon (C2) product selectivity. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that OHad favors the adsorption of low&#8208;frequency *CO with weak C&#8801;O bonds and strengthens the *CO binding at OD&#8722;Cu surface, promoting *CO dimerization and then selective C2 production. However, excessive OHad would inhibit selective C2 production by occupying active sites and facilitating competitive H2 evolution. In a flow cell, stable C2 production with high selectivity of &#8764;60&#8201;% at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved over OD&#8722;Cu, with adsorption of OHad well steered in the fast flowing electrolyte.

         <title>Pure and Metal&#8208;confining Carbon Nanotubes through Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide in Ca&#8208;based Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in affordable Ca&#8208;based molten salt is demonstrated as an efficient preparation of carbon nanotube (CNT, above) and metal&#8208;confining CNT (M@CNT, below) by a CaC2&#8208;mediated mechanism.







Abstract
To be successfully implemented, an efficient conversion, affordable operation and high values of CO2&#8208;derived products by electrochemical conversion of CO2 are yet to be addressed. Inspired by the natural CaO&#8208;CaCO3 cycle, we herein introduce CaO into electrolysis of SnO2 in affordable molten CaCl2&#8208;NaCl to establish an in situ capture and conversion of CO2. In situ capture of anodic CO2 from graphite anode by the added CaO generates CaCO3. The consequent co&#8208;electrolysis of SnO2 and CaCO3 confines Sn in carbon nanotube (Sn@CNT) in cathode and increases current efficiency of O2 evolution in graphite anode to 71.9&#8201;%. The intermediated CaC2 is verified as the nuclei to direct a self&#8208;template generation of CNT, ensuring a CO2&#8208;CNT current efficiency and energy efficiency of 85.1&#8201;% and 44.8&#8201;%, respectively. The Sn@CNT integrates confined responses of Sn cores to external electrochemical or thermal stimuli with robust CNT sheaths, resulting in excellent Li storage performance and intriguing application as nanothermometer. The versatility of the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in Ca&#8208;based molten salts for template&#8208;free generation of advanced carbon materials is evidenced by the successful generation of pure CNT, Zn@CNT and Fe@CNT.

         <title>Dimeric Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkenylation of Alkynes with a Versatile Silicon&#8208;Based Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of silanol as a removable directing group allows for dimeric manganese&#8208;catalyzed selective hydroalkenylation of alkynes at ambient conditions under an open air atmosphere. The resulting stereodefined 1,3&#8208;diene silanol products are obtained in good regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity while also being versatile building blocks for rich downstream transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we present a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, branched&#8208;selective hydroalkenylation of terminal alkynes, under mild conditions through facile installation of a versatile silanol as a removable directing group. With an alkenyl boronic acid as the coupling partner, this reaction produces stereodefined (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with high regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The protocol features mild reaction conditions such as room temperature and an air atmosphere, while maintaining excellent functional group compatibility. The resulting 1,3&#8208;dienesilanol products serve as versatile building blocks, as the removal of the silanol group allows for the synthesis of both branched terminal 1,3&#8208;dienes for downstream coupling reactions, as well as stereoselective construction of linear (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and (E,E,E)&#8208; or (E,E,Z)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienes. In addition, a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition can smoothly and selectively deliver silicon&#8208;containing pentasubstituted cyclohexene derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, in conjunction with DFT calculations, suggest a bimetallic synergistic activation model to account for the observed enhanced catalytic efficiency and good regioselectivity.

         <title>Multiple Heteroatom&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Bridging Electron Transport in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Supramolecular System for Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway is revealed in a noncovalent&#8208;linked supramolecular photosystem, starting from readily available COF and metal&#8208;bipyridine complex. The hydrogen bonding supramolecular system exhibits enhanced electron transfer and performance for CO2 photoreduction. This work provides an avenue to rationally design easily accessible photosystems.







Abstract
Supramolecular systems consisting of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and Ni complex are designed for robust photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Multiple heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonding between the COF and Ni complex is identified to play a decisive role in the photoexcited electron transfer across the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The diminution of steric groups on COF or metal complex can optimize catalytic performance, which is more attributable to the enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction rather than their intrinsic activity. The photosystem with relatively strong strength of hydrogen bonds exhibits remarkable photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, far superior to photosystems with supported atomic Ni or metal complex alone in the absence of hydrogen&#8208;bond effect. Such heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway confers supramolecular system with high photocatalytic performance, providing an avenue to rationally design efficient and steadily available photosystems.

         <title>Alleviating Side Reactions on Zn Anodes for Aqueous Batteries by a Cell Membrane Derived Phosphorylcholine Zwitterionic Protective Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyzwitterionic protective layer with phosphate and choline groups was engineered to alleviate the side reactions on Zn anode. The choline group can adsorb on Zn anode to expel H2O and regulate the Zn deposition behavior, and the phosphate group can decrease the Zn2+ desolvation energy barrier and form transfer route for faster ion migration, thus rendering the Zn anode with excellent rate performance and stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries are attractive for next generation batteries with high safety, yet their applications are still hindered by the uncontrollable dendrite formation and side reactions on Zn anode. Here, a polyzwitterion protective layer (PZIL) was engineered by polymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) in carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), which renders the following merits: the choline groups of MPC can preferentially adsorb onto Zn metal to avoid side reactions; the charged phosphate groups chelate with Zn2+ to regulate the solvation structure, further improving side reaction inhibition; the Hofmeister effect between ZnSO4 and CMCS can enhance the interfacial contact during electrochemical characterization. Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with PZIL can keep stable for more than 1000&#8197;hours under the ultra&#8208;high current density of 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The PZIL confers the Zn/MnO2 full battery and Zn/active carbon (AC) capacitor with stable cycling performance under high current density.

         <title>Dual Photosensitizer Coupled Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method allows dual&#8208;photosensitizer&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (3D MCOF) photocatalysts to be built by covalently linking two types of traditional photosensitizers (such as pyridine ruthenium and metalloporphyrin complex). These MCOFs exhibit outstanding activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and the in situ produced hydrogen can be used in tandem for alkyne hydrogenation.







Abstract
In this work, we innovatively assembled two types of traditional photosensitizers, that is pyridine ruthenium/ferrum (Ru(bpy)32+/Fe(bpy)32+) and porphyrin/metalloporphyrin complex (2HPor/ZnPor) by covalent linkage to get a series of dual photosensitizer&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs), which behaved strong visible light&#8208;absorbing ability, efficient electron transfer and suitable band gap for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution. Rubpy&#8208;ZnPor COF achieved the highest H2 yield (30&#8201;338&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.68&#8201;%@420&#8197;nm, which showed one of the best performances among all reported COF based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the in situ produced H2 was successfully tandem used in the alkyne hydrogenation with &#8776;99.9&#8201;% conversion efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that both the two photosensitizer units in MCOFs can be photoexcited and thus contribute optimal photocatalytic activity. This work develops a general strategy and shows the great potential of using multiple photosensitive materials in the field of photocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile method allows dual-photosensitizer-based three-dimensional metal-covalent organic framework (3D MCOF) photocatalysts to be built by covalently linking two types of traditional photosensitizers (such as pyridine ruthenium and metalloporphyrin complex). These MCOFs exhibit outstanding activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and the in situ produced hydrogen can be used in tandem for alkyne hydrogenation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we innovatively assembled two types of traditional photosensitizers, that is pyridine ruthenium/ferrum (Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and porphyrin/metalloporphyrin complex (2HPor/ZnPor) by covalent linkage to get a series of dual photosensitizer-based three-dimensional metal-covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs), which behaved strong visible light-absorbing ability, efficient electron transfer and suitable band gap for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) evolution. Rubpy-ZnPor COF achieved the highest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield (30&#8201;338&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.68&#8201;%@420&#8197;nm, which showed one of the best performances among all reported COF based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the in situ produced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was successfully tandem used in the alkyne hydrogenation with &#8776;99.9&#8201;% conversion efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that both the two photosensitizer units in MCOFs can be photoexcited and thus contribute optimal photocatalytic activity. This work develops a general strategy and shows the great potential of using multiple photosensitive materials in the field of photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harmonious Heterointerfaces Formed on 2D&#8208;Pt Nanodendrites by Facet&#8208;Respective Stepwise Metal Deposition for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Metal Nanohybrids with harmonious heterointerfaces have been synthesized by facet&#8208;respective stepwise metal deposition. These hybrid nanomaterial can approach superior electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance induced by unique multi heterointerfaces in specific facet for effective activation of platinum.







Abstract
The performance of nanocrystal (NC) catalysts could be maximized by introducing rationally designed heterointerfaces formed by the facet&#8208; and spatio&#8208;specific modification with other materials of desired size and thickness. However, such heterointerfaces are limited in scope and synthetically challenging. Herein, we applied a wet chemistry method to tunably deposit Pd and Ni on the available surfaces of porous 2D&#8722;Pt nanodendrites (NDs). Using 2D silica nanoreactors to house the 2D&#8208;PtND, an 0.5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (e&#8208;Pd or e&#8208;Ni) was exclusively formed on the flat {110} surface of 2D&#8722;Pt, while a non&#8208;epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (n&#8208;Pd or n&#8208;Ni) was typically deposited at the {111/100} edge in absence of nanoreactor. Notably, these differently located Pd/Pt and Ni/Pt heterointerfaces experienced distinct electronic effect to influence unequally in electrocatalytic synergy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For instance, an enhanced H2 generation on the Pt{110} facet with 2D&#8208;2D interfaced e&#8208;Pd deposition and faster water dissociation on the edge&#8208;located n&#8208;Ni overpowered their facet&#8208;located counterparts in respective HER catalysis. Therefore, a feasible assembling of the valuable heterointerfaces in the optimal 2D n&#8208;Ni/e&#8208;Pd/Pt catalyst overcame the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics, with a catalytic activity 7.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Influence of Molecular Separation on Through&#8208;Space Intervalence Transient Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Cofacially arranged Redox Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extent of electronic coupling and through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer in photo&#8208;conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks is unveiled through dynamic studies, charge transfer integral and charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;mobility measurement. Their influence on molecular separation is also revealed.







Abstract
We demonstrate direct evidence of photoinduced through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) between two cofacially arranged redox&#8208;active pairs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their dynamic variation with their molecular separation. Two homologous MOFs [Co2(NDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DPTTZ. DMF, 1 and [Co2(BDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DMF, 2 (where NDC=naphthalene dicarboxylate, BDC=benzene dicarboxylate, DPTTZ=N, N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiazolo&#8208;[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, DMF=N, N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl formamide) are considered for this, whose intra&#8208;dimer distance of redox&#8208;active DPTTZ ligands differs ca. 1&#8197;&#197; from one system to another. Spectroelectrochemical study detects the formation of IVCT band at the NIR region between cofacially oriented DPTTZ molecules in both MOFs. Transient spectroscopy shows faster charge separation as well as charge recombination when intra&#8208;dimer distance is lesser (in MOF 2) due to stronger electronic coupling. We quantify the extent of IVCT by charge transfer integral calculation; and also by optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy, where MOF 2 shows three times higher carrier mobility due to lesser inter&#8208;DPTTZ distance than MOF 1. These findings reveal a more localized aspect of through&#8208;space IVCT between cofacially organized redox&#8208;active pair in a three&#8208;dimensional framework.

         <title>Inside Cover: Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 31/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring new fields: Lanthanide&#8208;using bacteria that turn over methane or methanol in their metabolism can replace essential lanthanides by certain actinides. In their Research Article (e202303669), Lena&#8197;J. Daumann et&#8197;al. show that an extremophile isolated from a volcanic mud&#8208;pot as well as a methylotrophic laboratory strain can use americium and curium. In vivo growth experiments as well as in vitro studies with the key metabolic enzyme methanol dehydrogenase support that these actinides can sustain the one&#8208;carbon metabolism of these bacteria.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring new fields&lt;/b&gt;: Lanthanide-using bacteria that turn over methane or methanol in their metabolism can replace essential lanthanides by certain actinides. In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202303669"&gt;(e202303669)&lt;/a&gt;, Lena&#8197;J. Daumann et&#8197;al. show that an extremophile isolated from a volcanic mud-pot as well as a methylotrophic laboratory strain can use americium and curium. In vivo growth experiments as well as in vitro studies with the key metabolic enzyme methanol dehydrogenase support that these actinides can sustain the one-carbon metabolism of these bacteria.

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Photocatalytic Activation of CO2 in Ionic Liquids Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208; and photocatalytic CO2 activation by and in ionic liquids (ILs) offers sustainable fuels and valuable products. ILs form ionic nano&#8208;cages around the catalysts which are akin to membrane&#8208;like devices that selectively control the permeability/diffusion of substrates, intermediates, and products. In this minireview, the potential of ILs for academic research and the chemical industry are summarized.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered to be potential material devices for CO2 capturing and conversion to energy&#8208;adducts. They form a cage (confined&#8208;space) around the catalyst providing an ionic nano&#8208;container environment which serves as physical&#8208;chemical barrier that selectively controls the diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products to the catalytic active sites via their hydrophobicity and contact ion pairs. Hence, the electronic properties of the catalysts in ILs can be tuned by the proper choice of the IL&#8208;cations and anions that strongly influence the residence time/diffusion of the reactants, intermediates, and products in the nano&#8208;environment.

&lt;p&gt;Thermo- and photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation by and in ionic liquids (ILs) offers sustainable fuels and valuable products. ILs form ionic nano-cages around the catalysts which are akin to membrane-like devices that selectively control the permeability/diffusion of substrates, intermediates, and products. In this minireview, the potential of ILs for academic research and the chemical industry are summarized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered to be potential material devices for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capturing and conversion to energy-adducts. They form a cage (confined-space) around the catalyst providing an ionic nano-container environment which serves as physical-chemical barrier that selectively controls the diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products to the catalytic active sites via their hydrophobicity and contact ion pairs. Hence, the electronic properties of the catalysts in ILs can be tuned by the proper choice of the IL-cations and anions that strongly influence the residence time/diffusion of the reactants, intermediates, and products in the nano-environment. On the other hand, ILs provide driving force towards photocatalytic redox process to increase the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. By combining ILs with the semiconductor, unique solid semiconductor-liquid commodities are generated that can lower the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation energy barrier by modulating the electronic properties of the semiconductor surface. This mini-review provides a brief overview of the recent advances in IL assisted thermal conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to hydrocarbons, formic acid, methanol, dimethyl carbonate, and cyclic carbonates as well as its photo-conversion to solar fuels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Monomer Design Synergizing Property Trade&#8208;offs in Developing Polymers for Circularity and Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid monomer design can unify desired but conflicting properties in a single monomer that in turn leads to intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties that can be radically different than those of the parent homopolymers or copolymers.







Abstract
Current search for more sustainable plastics seeks to redesign polymers possessing both chemical recyclability to monomer for a circular plastics economy and desirable performance that can rival or even exceed today's non&#8208;recyclable or hard&#8208;to&#8208;recycle petroleum&#8208;based incumbents. However, within a traditional monomer framework it is challenging to optimize, concurrently, contrasting polymerizability/depolymerizability and recyclability/performance properties. Here, we highlight the emerging hybrid monomer design strategy to develop intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties, aiming to unify desired, but otherwise conflicting, properties in a single monomer. Conceptually, this design hybridizes parent monomer pairs of contrasting, mismatching, or matching properties into offspring monomers that not only unify the above&#8208;described conflicting properties but also radically alter the resultant polymer properties far beyond the limits of what either parent homopolymers or their copolymers can achieve.

         <title>Exploiting Interactions between Polyoxometalates and Proteins for Applications in (Bio)chemistry and Medicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>

This Review aims to provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the interactions between polyoxometalates and proteins that make this vast family of anionic nanoclusters interesting potential inorganic drugs, effective catalysts for selective protein modification, multifunctional crystallizing agents, and versatile protein separation materials.







Abstract
The specific interactions of anionic metal&#8208;oxo clusters, known as polyoxometalates (POMs), with proteins can be leveraged for a wide range of analytical and biomedical applications. For example, POMs have been developed as selective catalysts that can induce protein modifications and have also been shown to facilitate protein crystallization, both of which are instrumental in the structural characterization of proteins. POMs can also be used for selective protein separation and enzyme inhibition, which makes them promising therapeutic agents. Hence, understanding POM&#8208;protein interactions is essential for the development of POM&#8208;based materials and their implementation in several fields. In this Review we summarize in detail the key insights that have been gained so far on POM&#8208;protein interactions. Emphasis is also given to hybrid POMs functionalized with organic ligands to prompt further research in this direction owing to the promising recent results on tuning POM&#8208;protein interactions through POM functionalization.

         <title>Enantioselective Strategies for The Synthesis of N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers are highlighted and discussed within this Review. In particular, the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric architecture are presented while a particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Axially chiral compounds have been always considered a laboratory curiosity with rare prospects of being applied in asymmetric synthesis. Things have changed very quickly in the last twenty years when it was understood the important role and the enormous impact that these compounds have in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers became a rapidly expanding field and recent reports on the development of N&#8722;N atropisomers strongly prove how this research field is a hot topic open to new challenges and frontiers of asymmetric synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers highlighting the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric framework.

         <title>Connecting Ruthenium Photocatalysis to 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane&#8208;Mediated Chemiluminescence: a Versatile Combination for Optical Detection and Read&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful linkage of ruthenium photocatalysis with highly sensitive and selectively triggerable chemiluminescence read&#8208;out from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is demonstrated. The ruthenium&#8208;dioxetane system was shown to be useful for the quantification of optical input by inverse correlation with optical output. Further on, the system was applied to detect the Ru(bpy)3Cl2 catalyst at nanomolar concentrations, highlighting the future applicability.







Abstract
Optical storage and photon quantification systems based on sensitive photoreactions have numerous applications. Herein, we report a highly efficient photocatalytic reaction, in which ruthenium photoredox catalysis is combined with a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane from which chemiluminescence can be triggered. In this system, blue light irradiation as optical input enables a defined inverse correlation with base&#8208;triggered, blue light emission as optical output. Comparison of readout by 1H&#8197;NMR and chemiluminescence, relative to previous optical input, underlines the reliability and usefulness of the ruthenium&#8208;dioxetane system for optical storage, sensing and ruthenium detection.

         <title>Versatile Production of Multivariate, Hyperdimensional End Group and Main Chain Functionalized Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly versatile and general strategy is presented and experimentally validated for production of an endless variety of functionalized polyolefins through the (stereoselective) living coordinative (chain transfer) copolymerization of 1&#8208;alkenes and 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,6&#8208;heptadienes as comonomers. This includes telechelic polyolefins with orthogonal reactive end&#8208;group and main&#8208;chain functionality and microphase&#8208;segregated &#8220;two&#8208;color&#8221; block copolymers.







Abstract
The (stereoselective) living coordinative copolymerization of 1&#8208;alkenes with 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,6&#8208;heptadienes, in both the absence and presence of multiple equivalents of a reversible chain transfer agent, is established as a highly versatile strategy for production of multivariate hyperdimensional functionalized semi&#8208;crystalline or amorphous polyolefins that optionally possess either mono&#8208; or difunctionalized (telechelic) end&#8208;groups in combination with a programmable level of incorporation of orthogonal functional groups within the main&#8208;chain. The non&#8208;conjugated diene comonomers are readily obtained from a diverse range of aryl carboxaldehyde precursors through a one&#8208;step bis&#8208;allylation process. These results serve to provide a new platform for exploring the science and technology of a vast new landscape of functionalized classes of polyolefins that are now accessible in practical and scalable quantities.

&lt;p&gt;The (stereoselective) living coordinative copolymerization of 1-alkenes with 4-aryl-1,6-heptadienes, in both the absence and presence of multiple equivalents of a reversible chain transfer agent, is established as a highly versatile strategy for production of multivariate hyperdimensional functionalized semi-crystalline or amorphous polyolefins that optionally possess either mono- or difunctionalized (telechelic) end-groups in combination with a programmable level of incorporation of orthogonal functional groups within the main-chain. The non-conjugated diene comonomers are readily obtained from a diverse range of aryl carboxaldehyde precursors through a one-step bis-allylation process. These results serve to provide a new platform for exploring the science and technology of a vast new landscape of functionalized classes of polyolefins that are now accessible in practical and scalable quantities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Covered with Biomolecular Machine &#8220;Chaperonin GroEL&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanoparticle covered with the biomolecular machine &#8220;chaperonin GroEL&#8221; (GroELNP) allows the capture of denatured proteins and their controlled release in response to ATP and shows a nearly 5&#8208;times enhanced ATPase activity compared to the precursor GroEL. Building on GroELNP, 
NP having two layers of GroEL was iteratively synthesized, demonstrating the potential to construct higher&#8208;order structures therefrom.







Abstract
Herein, we report an ATP&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (GroELNP) whose surface is fully covered with the biomolecular machine &#8220;chaperonin protein GroEL&#8221;. GroELNP was synthesized by DNA hybridization between a gold NP with DNA strands on its surface and GroEL carrying complementary DNA strands at its apical domains. The unique structure of GroELNP was visualized by transmission electron microscopy including under cryogenic conditions. The immobilized GroEL units retain their machine&#8208;like function and enable GroELNP to capture denatured green fluorescent protein and release it in response to ATP. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of GroELNP per GroEL was 4.8 and 4.0 times greater than those of precursor cysGroEL and its DNA&#8208;functionalized analogue, respectively. Finally, we confirmed that GroELNP could be iteratively extended to double&#8208;layered 
NP.

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Hindered Molecular p&#8208;Dopants Promote Integer Charge Transfer in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integer charge transfer in the p&#8208;doping of organic semiconductors can be suppressed by intermolecular hybridization reducing the doping efficiency. We test the hypothesis that steric hindrance can be exploited to inhibit this process for a novel three&#8208;dimensional dopant whose doping behavior is contrasted with an equally strong planar species. We find that utilizing steric hindrance in dopant design indeed promotes integer charge transfer.







Abstract
Molecular p&#8208;dopants designed to undergo electron transfer with organic semiconductors are typically planar molecules with high electron affinity. However, their planarity can promote the formation of ground&#8208;state charge transfer complexes with the semiconductor host and results in fractional instead of integer charge transfer, which is highly detrimental to doping efficiency. Here, we show this process can be readily overcome by targeted dopant design exploiting steric hindrance. To this end, we synthesize and characterize the remarkably stable p&#8208;dopant 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(cyclopropane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triylidene)tris(2&#8208;(perfluorophenyl)acetonitrile) comprising pendant functional groups that sterically shield its central core while retaining high electron affinity. Finally, we demonstrate it outperforms a planar dopant of identical electron affinity and increases the thin film conductivity by up to an order of magnitude. We believe exploiting steric hindrance represents a promising design strategy towards molecular dopants of enhanced doping efficiency.

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization and Fluorogenic Labeling of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methyltransferase ribozyme (MTR1) catalyzes site&#8208;specific alkylation of a purine nucleobase to initiate the formation of the 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;formylimidazole nucleobase analogue, which serves as the precursor for the fluorogenic condensation with a trimethylindole moiety to yield fluorescent hemicyanine&#8208;labeled RNA. The reaction with other aldehyde&#8208;reactive probes is also demonstrated for short RNAs as well as fluorescent labeling of full&#8208;length tRNA.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific introduction of bioorthogonal handles into RNAs is in high demand for decorating RNAs with fluorophores, affinity labels or other modifications. Aldehydes represent attractive functional groups for post&#8208;synthetic bioconjugation reactions. Here, we report a ribozyme&#8208;based method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;functionalized RNA by directly converting a purine nucleobase. Using the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 as an alkyltransferase, the reaction is initiated by site&#8208;specific N1 benzylation of purine, followed by nucleophilic ring opening and spontaneous hydrolysis under mild conditions to yield a 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;formylimidazole residue in good yields. The modified nucleotide is accessible to aldehyde&#8208;reactive probes, as demonstrated by the conjugation of biotin or fluorescent dyes to short synthetic RNAs and tRNA transcripts. Upon fluorogenic condensation with a 2,3,3&#8208;trimethylindole, a novel hemicyanine chromophore was generated directly on the RNA. This work expands the MTR1 ribozyme's area of application from a methyltransferase to a tool for site&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage functionalization of RNA.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydrative Aldol Reaction (HAR) via Vinyl&#8208;Gold Promoted Intermolecular Ynamide Addition to Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
The application of Fe(acac)3 as a cocatalyst prevents vinyl gold protodeauration, allowing for its nucleophilic addition to aldehydes. Hence, the intermolecular vinyl gold&#8208;promoted asymmetric hydrative aldol reaction (HAR) of ynamides and aldehydes was shown possible and is herein presented. The reaction leads to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides with high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r, 99&#8201;% ee) under mild conditions (base&#8208;free, 40&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Herein, we reported an intermolecular asymmetric hydrative aldol reaction through vinyl&#8208;gold intermediate under ambient conditions. This tandem alkyne hydration and sequential nucleophilic addition afforded a &#8220;base&#8208;free&#8221; approach to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides with high efficiency (up to 95&#8201;% yields, &gt;50 examples). Vinyl gold intermediate was applied as reactive nucleophile and Fe(acac)3 was used as the critical co&#8208;catalyst to prevent undesired protodeauration, allowing this transformation to proceed under mild conditions with good functional group tolerance and excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r. and up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <dc:description>
ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) are rationally designed and prepared via the cation and ligand exchange reactions to serve as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8722;S batteries.

Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems in view of the high theoretical energy density and low cost of sulfur resources. The suppression of polysulfide diffusion and promotion of redox kinetics are the main challenges for Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, we design and prepare a novel type of ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) to serve as a functional sulfur host for Li&#8722;S batteries. The hollow architecture of ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can ensure fast charge transfer, improved sulfur utilization, and effective confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The atomically dispersed Co&#8722;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can firmly capture LiPSs and electrocatalytically accelerate their conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple structural advantages, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and prolonged cycling performance for 300&#8197;cycles.

         <title>A Humidity&#8208;Induced Large Electronic Conductivity Change of 107 on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Sensitive Water Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;induced large electronic conductivity change of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed with the &#8722;NH2 groups, and H2SO4 played an important role in regulating the conductivity. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, a high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensor was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range and lowest limit of detection amongst all the reported sensing materials to date.







Abstract
The electronic conductivity (EC) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is sensitive to strongly oxidizing guest molecules. Water is a relatively mild species, however, the effect of H2O on the EC of MOFs is rarely reported. We explored the effect of H2O on the EC in the MOFs (NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and its derivatives with experimental and theoretical investigations. Unexpectedly, a large EC increase of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 by H2O was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed with the &#8722;NH2 groups, and H2SO4 played an important role in promoting the charge transfer from H2O to the MOF. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, a high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensor was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range, and lowest limit of detection amongst all reported sensing materials to date. This work not only demonstrated that H2O can remarkably influence the EC of MOFs, but it also revealed that post&#8208;modification of the structure of MOFs could enhance the influence of the guest molecule on their EC to design high&#8208;performance sensing materials.

         <title>Active Ensembles in Methane Dehydroaromatization over Molybdenum/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Identified by 2D 1H&#8722;95Mo Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D 1H&#8208;95Mo heteronuclear correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy was used to reveal the active ensembles formed in the methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reaction over Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. The evolution of the local environment consisting of Mo species, acidic sites, and organic compounds was monitored during the reaction. Two types of active MoOxCy species were observed, which were differentiated by correlating with the MDA activity.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) over Mo&#8208;modified zeolite is a potential catalytic route for converting natural gas into valuable aromatics. However, the active species in this reaction are highly complex, involving diverse Mo species, acidic sites of zeolite, and organic molecules. Herein, we apply 1D 95Mo NMR and 2D 1H&#8208;95Mo heteronuclear correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to directly observe the active ensembles in the confined channels of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite during the MDA reaction. We monitor the evolution of the spatial correlations of Mo species with the Br&#248;nsted acid sites and organic products (olefins and aromatics) in the zeolite channels. We identified two kinds of MoOxCy species, with the more carbidic one (MoOxCy&#8208;II) exhibiting higher activity for methane activation and benzene formation. The strong spatial interactions between the active Mo species and the organic species in the Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 pores are related to the MDA activity.

         <title>Enaminone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enaminone&#8208;linked COFs (En&#8208;COFs) are synthesized and firstly attempted for photocatalysis. Compared with the corresponding imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) and quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (Qu&#8208;COFs) with almost identical structures but altered linkages, En&#8208;COFs possess boosted photocatalytic activity with extended light adsorption, facilitated exciton dissociation and improved stability, making them a promising platform for enhanced photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), possessing pre&#8208;designable structures and tailorable functionalities, are promising candidates for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the most studied imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) usually suffer from unsatisfactory stability and photocatalytic performance. To meet this challenge, a series of highly stable enaminone&#8208;linked COFs (En&#8208;COFs) have been synthesized and afford much improved visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production activities, ranging from 44 to 1078&#8197;times that of isoreticular Im&#8208;COFs, with the only difference being the linkages (enaminone vs. imine) in their structures. The enhanced light&#8208;harvesting ability, facilitated exciton dissociation and improved chemical stability account for the superior activity. Furthermore, quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (Qu&#8208;COFs) have been further obtained via the post&#8208;modification of Im&#8208;COFs. Compared with Im&#8208;COFs, the photocatalytic activities of Qu&#8208;COFs are significantly improved after modification, but still below those of the corresponding En&#8208;COFs (3&#8211;107&#8197;times). The facile synthesis, excellent activity, and high chemical stability demonstrate that En&#8208;COFs are a promising platform for photocatalysis.

         <title>Dynamical Equilibrium between Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Sites in Zeolites: Framework&#8208;Associated Octahedral Aluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The details of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum are revealed for the first time, based on a combined experimental and computational study. Framework&#8208;associated Al(Oh) becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions at sufficiently low Si/Al, while its thermodynamic stability with respect to regular Br&#248;nsted tetrahedral site decreases with decreasing water loading.







Abstract
While the structures of Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites are well understood, those of Lewis acid sites (LAS) remain an active area of investigation. Under hydrated conditions, the reversible formation of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum has been observed in zeolites in the acidic form. However, the structure and formation mechanisms are currently unknown. In this work, combined experimental 27Al NMR spectroscopy and computational data reveal for the first time the details of the zeolite framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium. The octahedral LAS site becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions in the presence of multiple nearby BAS sites. The critical condition for the existence of such octahedral LAS appears to be the availability of three protons: at lower proton concentration, either by increasing the Si/Al or by ion&#8208;exchange to non&#8208;acidic form, the tetrahedral BAS becomes thermodynamically more stable. This work resolves the question about the nature and reversibility of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium in zeolites.

&lt;p&gt;The details of framework-associated octahedral aluminum are revealed for the first time, based on a combined experimental and computational study. Framework-associated Al(O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions at sufficiently low Si/Al, while its thermodynamic stability with respect to regular Br&#248;nsted tetrahedral site decreases with decreasing water loading.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Illisimonin&#8197;A and Merrilactone&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive biosynthetic pathway was proposed for illicium sesquiterpenes. The key transformations of the biosynthetic pathway, which include retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction, were supported by the total syntheses of illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A from a common intermediate.







Abstract
Illicium sesquiterpenes are a large family of biologically active secondary metabolites isolated from Illicium species of plants and are well&#8208;known for their activity of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Herein, we propose a comprehensive biosynthetic pathway for illicium sesquiterpenes and report a synthetic route to illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A based on it. We think that the carbon scaffolds of most of the illicium sesquiterpenes could be synthesized from a dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane through retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction at suitable oxidation states in Nature. The common intermediate for illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A similar to the dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane was assembled with up to 82&#8201;% ee by an asymmetric intramolecular desymmetrizing reductive Heck reaction by the use of a new type of chiral phosphine ligand. The syntheses of illisimonin&#8197;A and merrilactone&#8197;A supported the key transformations of the proposed biosynthetic pathway.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of the Bacterial Sesterviridene Synthase from Kitasatospora viridis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase has been discovered from Kitasatospora viridis that produces sesterviridene&#8197;A in high yield. Several derivatives were synthesised, confirming the NMR based structure elucidation. The absolute configuration was determined through chemical correlation and anomalous dispersion X&#8208;ray. The cyclisation mechanism of the sesterviridene synthase StvirS was deeply studied in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A gene coding for a terpene synthase homolog from Kitasatospora viridis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein possessed sesterterpene synthase activity and efficiently converted geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP) with 19&#8201;% yield into the sesterterpene hydrocarbon sesterviridene&#8197;A. Large scale enzymatic conversions also allowed for the isolation of two side products that are generated with very low yields of ca. 0.1&#8201;%. Several derivatives of sesterviridene&#8197;A were obtained by chemical transformations, securing the NMR&#8208;based structural assignments. The absolute configuration of sesterviridene&#8197;A was determined by chemical correlation using stereoselectively deuterated precursors and by anomalous dispersion X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cyclisation mechanism from GFPP to sesterviridene&#8197;A was extensively studied through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Emitters Enable High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Red Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of narrowband red fluorescent emitters based on a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton were designed. These emitters explore the use of a methyl&#8208;shield strategy to assemble high&#8208;performance narrowband red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on traditional fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are receiving significant attention and have demonstrated impressive performance in blue and green OLEDs. However, developing high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs remains a highly desired yet challenging task. Herein, we have developed narrowband red fluorescent emitters by utilizing a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton in combination with a methyl&#8208;shield strategy. These emitters exhibit small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) ranging from 21&#8197;nm (0.068&#8197;eV) to 25&#8197;nm (0.081&#8197;eV) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) ranging from 88.5&#8201;% to 99.0&#8201;% in toluene solution. Using BODIPY&#8208;based luminescent materials as emitters, high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs have been assembled with external quantum efficiency as high as 18.3&#8201;% at 623&#8197;nm and 21.1&#8201;% at 604&#8197;nm. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first successful case of achieving NTSC pure&#8208;red OLEDs with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of [0.67, 0.33] based on conventional fluorescent emitters.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Biomimetic Extracellular Matrix for Cell Nanoencapsulation and Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic extracellular matrix is synthesized on the surface of live cells as a cell nanocapsule to carry nanoparticles. Nanoparticles at the vicinity of the encapsulated cell surface allow for on&#8208;demand regulation of intracellular gene expression. As any or multiple nanoparticles can be applied to decorate the nanocapsule, this work demonstrates a promising technology platform for cell encapsulation and regulation.







Abstract
Cell encapsulation has been studied for various applications ranging from cell transplantation to biological production. However, current encapsulation technologies focus on cell protection rather than cell regulation that is essential to most if not all cell&#8208;based applications. Here we report a method for cell nanoencapsulation and regulation using an ultrathin biomimetic extracellular matrix as a cell nanocapsule to carry nanoparticles (CN2). This method allows high&#8208;capacity nanoparticle retention at the vicinity of cell surfaces. The encapsulated cells maintain high viability and normal metabolism. When gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as a model to decorate the nanocapsule, light irradiation transiently increases the temperature, leading to the activation of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter and the regulation of reporter gene expression. As the biomimetic nanocapsule can be decorated with any or multiple NPs, CN2 is a promising platform for advancing cell&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Anthracene&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 31, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin dimer and trimer oligomers were synthesized by fusing porphyrin and anthracene units in an edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge manner. Efficient intramolecular &#960;&#8208;delocalization is demonstrated by absorption spectra extending far into the near&#8208;IR and by high redox activity. This is a promising strategy for incorporating metal ions into a 1D semiconductor through solution&#8208;phase synthesis.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated nanoribbons attract interest because of their unusual electronic structures and charge&#8208;transport behavior. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of fully edge&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;anthracene oligomeric ribbons (dimer and trimer), together with a computational study of the corresponding infinite polymer. The porphyrin dimer and trimer were synthesized in high yield, via oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of singly linked precursors, using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). The crystal structure of the dimer shows that the central &#960;&#8208;system is flat, with a slight S&#8208;shaped wave distortion at each porphyrin terminal. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation causes a dramatic red&#8208;shift in the absorption spectra: the absorption maxima of the fused dimer and trimer appear at 1188&#8197;nm and 1642&#8197;nm, respectively (for the nickel complexes dissolved in toluene). The coordinated metal in the dimer was changed from Ni to Mg, using p&#8208;tolylmagnesium bromide, providing access to free&#8208;base and Zn complexes. These results open a versatile avenue to longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanoribbons with integrated metalloporphyrin units.

         <title>Proton/Mg2+ Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Mg&#8208;Ion Batteries: From the Interface to the Inner</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;insertion of protons happens widely and enables divalent&#8208;ion aqueous batteries to achieve high performances. However, detailed investigations and comprehensive understandings of proton co&#8208;insertion are scarce.Herein, we demonstrate that proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution, the formation of Mg&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO2(B) electrode and co&#8208;insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg2++H2O is 2.7 eV, while that of the protons is 0.37 eV. Thus, protons dominate the subsequent insertion and inner diffusion.As a consequence, the VO2(B) achieves a high capacity of 257.0 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 A g&#8211;1, a high rate retention of 59.1% from 1 to 8 A g&#8211;1, and stable cyclability of 3000 times with a capacity retention of 81.5%. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the proton co&#8208;insertion and may promote the development of rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electronegative Channels as Cationic Highways for Sustainable Lithium Metal Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous interest in Li metal as an ideal anode material, the uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have plagued its practical application. These limitations can be attributed to the sluggish and uneven Li+ migration towards Li metal surface. Here, we report olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron&#8208;rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78 mS cm&#8722;1). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700 h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.</dc:description>

Here, we report olefin-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron-rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78 mS cm&#8722;1). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700 h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetalation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetalation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Bidirectional Axial Coordination into BiVO4@Metal Phthalocyanine Core&#8211;Shell Photoanodes for Efficient Water Oxidation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;shell photoanodes have shown great potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the construction of a high&#8208;quality interface between the core and shell, as well as a highly catalytic surface, remains a challenge. Herein, guided by computation, we present a BiVO4 photoanode coated with ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine using pyrazine as a coordination agent. The bidirectional axial coordination of pyrazine plays a dual role by facilitating intimate interfacial contact between BiVO4 and ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine, as well as regulating the electron density and spin configuration of metal sites in ZnCoFe phthalocyanine, thereby promoting the potential&#8208;limiting step of *OOH desorption. The resulting photoanode displayed a high photocurrent density of 5.7&#177;0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 VRHE. This study introduces a new approach for constructing core&#8208;shell photoanodes, and uncovers the key role of pyrazine axial coordination in modulating the catalytic activity of metal phthalocyanine.</dc:description>

         <title>One/Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Excited ESIPT&#8208;Attributed Coordination Polymers with Wide Temperature Range and Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple metastable excited states provided by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules are beneficial to bring temperature&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL). Meanwhile, ESIPT molecules are intrinsically suitable to be modulated as D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure to obtain both one/two&#8208;photon excitation and LPL emission simultaneously. Herein, we report the rational design of a dynamic Cd(II) coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) from ESIPT ligand to achieve the above goals. By comparing LIFM&#8208;106 with the counterparts, we established a temperature&#8208;regulated competitive relationship between singlet excimer and triplet LPL emission. The optimization of ligand aggregation mode effectively boost the competitiveness of the latter. In result, LIFM&#8208;106 shows outstanding one/two&#8208;photon excited LPL performance with wide temperature range (100 &#8208; 380 K) and tunable color (green to red). The multichannel radiation process was further elucidated by transient absorption and theoretical calculations, benefiting for the application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Defect&#8208;Induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the structure and spatial distance of Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites in a porous system to construct efficient solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst is vital for industrial application but remains challenging. Herein, we constructed FLP sites in a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) by introducing coordination&#8208;defect metal nodes (LA) and surface&#8208;basic POM with abundant oxygen (LB). The well&#8208;defined and unique spatial conformation of the defective POM&#8208;based MOF ensure that the distance between LA and LB is at ~4.3 &#197;, a suitable distance to activate H2. This FLP catalyst can heterolytically dissociate H2 into active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting high activity in hydrogenation, which is 55 and 2.7 times as high as that of defect&#8208;free POM&#8208;based MOF and defective MOF without POM, respectively. This work provides a new avenue toward precise design multi&#8208;site catalyst to achieve specific activation of target substrate for synergistic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing the Crystallinity and Film Formation of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes through In Situ Modulation for Efficient Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) layers hold great promise as molecular sieve membranes for efficient gas separation. Nevertheless, the high crystallinity tends to cause inter&#8208;crystalline defects/cracks in the nearby crystals, which makes crystalline porous materials face a great challenge in the fabrication of defect&#8208;free membranes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the balance between crystallinity and film&#8208;formation of MOF membrane through a facile in situ modulation strategy. Monocarboxylic acid was introduced as a modulator to regulate the crystallinity via competitive complexation and thus concomitantly control the film&#8208;forming state during membrane growth. Through adjusting the ratio of modulator acid/linker acid, an appropriate balance between this structural &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; was achieved. The resulting MOF membrane with moderate crystallinity and coherent morphology exhibits molecular sieving for H2/CO2 separation with selectivity  up to 82.5.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low&#160;Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3&#160;using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature&#160;and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130 kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.</dc:description>

Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis represents an exciting merger of selective biocatalysis and green electrochemical methods for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. In this review we introduce the key concepts and vital applications of both enzymatic and microbial electrosynthetic systems.







Abstract
Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis is the conversion of electrical energy into value&#8208;added products using biocatalysts. These methods merge the specificity and selectivity of biocatalysis and energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis to address challenges in the sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, fuels, feedstocks and fertilizers. However, the specialized experimental setups and domain knowledge for bioelectrocatalysis pose a significant barrier to adoption. This review introduces key concepts of bioelectrosynthetic systems. We provide a tutorial on the methods of biocatalyst utilization, the setup of bioelectrosynthetic cells, and the analytical methods for assessing bioelectrocatalysts. Key applications of bioelectrosynthesis in ammonia production and small&#8208;molecule synthesis are outlined for both enzymatic and microbial systems. This review serves as a necessary introduction and resource for the non&#8208;specialist interested in bioelectrosynthetic research.

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle the concentration polarization and drive the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a 24&#8208;fold improvement generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%) as compared with the bare one.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration polarization, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra&#8208;low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high&#8208;level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst, a 24&#8208;fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.

         <title>Cooperative Network Formation via Two&#8208;Colour Light&#8208;Activated &#955;&#8208;Orthogonal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterotelechelic dilinker enables the generation of a polymer network exclusively via dual&#8208;colour irradiation. In contrast, single&#8208;colour irradiation results in polymer functionalization.







Abstract
Independently addressing photoreactive sites within one molecule with two colours of light is a formidable challenge. Here, we combine two sequence independent &#955;&#8208;orthogonal chromophores in one heterotelechelic dilinker molecule, to exploit their disparate reactivity utilizing the same reaction partner, a maleimide&#8208;containing polymer. We demonstrate that polymer network formation only proceeds if two colours of light are employed. Upon single colour irradiation, linker&#8208;decorated post&#8208;functionalized polymers are generated at either wavelength and in either sequence. Network formation, however, is only achieved by sequential or simultaneous two colour irradiation. The herein introduced photoreactive system demonstrates the power of wavelength orthogonal chemistry in macromolecular synthesis.

         <title>Reforming the Uniformity of Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Nanoscale Structure Regulation for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is proposed and constructed to improve the uniformity of SEI, in which LiNxOy generated by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives occupies the top layer and LiF formed by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) dominates the bottom layer next to lithium metal anodes. A lithium metal pouch cell with a specific energy of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the cell level undergoes 173&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active lithium and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe N1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated 1,2,4&#8208;triazinium salts as new bioorthogonal reagents. These heterodienes are stable under biological conditions and react selectively and at high rates with strained alkynes such as BCN, allowing efficient modification of biomolecules. The unique ionic character makes the compounds more water soluble and cell permeable. These features enable efficient labeling of intracellular targets in living cells.







Abstract
The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice compression at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale was first achieved in a newly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 nanocluster, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction compared to the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 nanocluster without lattice variation. DFT calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Lattice tuning at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified.

&lt;p&gt;Lattice compression at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale was first achieved in a newly synthesized Au&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;(CHT)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction compared to the same-sized Au&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;(TBBT)&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster without lattice variation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice tuning at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a &#8776;1&#8197;nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single-crystal X-ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;(CHT)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt; (CHT=S-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58&#8197;&#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice-compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) compared to that exhibited by the same-sized Au&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;(TBBT)&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; (TBBT=4-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Artificial Urinary Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial biomarker probes (AMPro) are developed for noninvasive urinalysis of acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) in murine models. With advantages of high renal clearance and specific detection of graft&#8208;infiltrating immune cells, AMPros noninvasively detected the onset of ARAR as accurate as invasive flow cytometry analysis, and specifically distinguished ARAR from non&#8208;allograft diseases or non&#8208;alloimmune&#8208;specific inflammatory patterns.







Abstract
Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) after kidney transplantation associated with reduced graft survival and eventual graft failure is poorly diagnosed in hospitals. Here, we report the development of Artificial bioMarker Probes (AMPros) for sensitive urinalysis of ARAR in murine models. AMPros spontaneously go to the kidneys after systemic administration, specifically react with the prodromal immune biomarkers to activate their near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals to report cell&#8208;mediated rejection, and efficiently undergo renal excretion into urine. Thus, AMPros enable convenient optical urinalysis that detects ARAR prior to histological manifestation of rejection, which is also earlier than current diagnostic methods measuring proinflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNAs. Due to the high kidney specificity, AMPros&#8208;based urinalysis discriminates allograft rejection against other non&#8208;alloimmune specific diseases, which is unattainable by measurement of serological biomarkers. Such a noninvasive and sensitive urine test holds great promise in continuous monitoring of renal allograft conditions at low resource settings for timely clinical interventions.

         <title>Tracking an FeV(O) Intermediate for Water Oxidation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand is effective at stabilizing high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates involved in the water oxidation reaction. UV/Vis, XAS, EPR, electrochemical and kinetic measurements, allow a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species that participates in O&#8722;O bond formation with higher reactivity and shorter lifetime to be tracked in a real catalytic water oxidation reaction.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species are appealing for conducting O&#8722;O bond formation for water oxidation reactions. However, their high reactivity poses a great challenge to the dissection of their chemical transformations. Herein, we introduce an electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand, 2&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;6&#8208;yl]propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol to stabilize such fleeting intermediates. Advanced spectroscopies and electrochemical studies demonstrate a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species formation in water. Combining kinetic and oxygen isotope labelling experiments and organic reactions indicates that the FeV(O) species is responsible for O&#8722;O bond formation via water nucleophilic attack under the real catalytic water oxidation conditions.

         <title>Unravelling the Superiority of Nonbenzenoid Acepleiadylene as a Building Block for Organic Semiconducting Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonbenzenoid acepleiadylene (APD) has been explored as a new building block to construct organic electronic material (APD&#8208;IID), which exhibits higher hole mobility than its pyrene&#8208;based isomers because of the stronger intermolecular interaction induced by the unique charge&#8208;separated character. These results demonstrate the superiority of nonbenzenoid arenes in the future development of organic semiconducting materials.







Abstract
Acepleiadylene (APD), a nonbenzenoid isomer of pyrene, exhibits a unique charge&#8208;separated character with a large molecular dipole and a small optical gap. However, APD has never been explored in optoelectronic materials to take advantage of these appealing properties. Here, we employ APD as a building block in organic semiconducting materials for the first time, and unravel the superiority of nonbenzenoid APD in electronic applications. We have synthesized an APD derivative (APD&#8208;IID) with APD as the terminal donor moieties and isoindigo (IID) as the acceptor core. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that APD&#8208;IID has an obvious charge&#8208;separated structure and enhanced intermolecular interactions as compared with its pyrene&#8208;based isomers. As a result, APD&#8208;IID displays significantly higher hole mobilities than those of the pyrene&#8208;based counterparts. These results imply the advantages of employing APD in semiconducting materials and great potential of nonbenzenoid polycyclic arenes for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Generic Platform for Upcycling Polystyrene to Aryl Ketones and Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochemical degradation utilizing AlCl3 recovers benzene from polystyrene in quantitative yields. The subsequent addition of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chlorides to the same reactor produces aryl ketones and sulfides in moderate to high yields. The one&#8208;pot cascade degradation&#8211;upcycling reactions present an effective strategy for converting polystyrene to valuable chemicals, including benzophenone, acetophenone, and diphenyl sulfide.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is one of the least recycled large&#8208;volume commodity plastics due to bulkiness of foam products and associated contaminants. PS recycling is also severely hampered by the lack of financial incentive, limited versatility, and poor selectivity of existing methods. To this end, herein we report a thermochemical recycling strategy of &#8220;degradation&#8208;upcycling&#8221; to synthesize a library of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals from PS wastes with high versatility and selectivity. Two cascade reactions are selected to first degrade PS to benzene under mild temperatures, followed by the derivatization thereof utilizing a variety of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chloride additives. To demonstrate the versatility, nine ketones and sulfides of cosmetic and pharmaceutical relevance were prepared, including propiophenone, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide. The approach is also amenable to sophisticated upcycling reaction designs and can produce desired products stepwise. The facile and versatile approach will provide a scalable and profitable methodology for upcycling PS waste into value&#8208;added chemicals.

An anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and anti&#8208;cluster of differentiation 3 bispecific antibody was synthesized which enabled the recruitment and activation of endogenous cytolytic T lymphocyte cells for tumor killing within organoids.







Abstract
Glycoengineering has provided powerful tools to construct site&#8208;specific antibody conjugates. However, only small&#8208;molecule payloads can be directly transferred to native or engineered antibodies using existing glycoengineering strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment (Fc) glycans could dramatically boost the chemoenzymatic modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) via an engineered fucosyltransferase. In this platform, antibodies with Fc glycans engineered to a simple N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) disaccharide are successfully conjugated to biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in a single step within hours. Accordingly, we synthesized an antibody&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) bispecific antibody and used it to selectively destroy patient&#8208;derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T lymphocyte cells (T cells) inside the organoid. Our results highlight that this platform is a general approach to construct antibody&#8208;biomacromolecule conjugates with translational values.

         <title>Mechanisms of Cysteine&#8208;Lysine Covalent Linkage&#8212;The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Competition with Disulfide Bonds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual &#8220;NOS&#8221; bond with a bridging oxygen atom can form under oxidising conditions between a cysteine and a lysine residue. Now the reaction mechanisms for the formation of single and double NOS bonds in proteins have been computationally investigated. More than 30 reactions were considered for oxidation pathways involving different reactive oxygen species, providing a comprehensive overview of cysteine oxidation pathways.







Abstract
Recently, a new naturally occurring covalent linkage was characterised, involving a cysteine and a lysine, bridged through an oxygen atom. The latter was dubbed as the NOS bond, reflecting the individual atoms involved in this uncommon bond which finds little parallel in lab chemistry. It is found to form under oxidising conditions and is reversible upon addition of reducing agents. Further studies have identified the bond in crystal structures across a variety of systems and organisms, potentially playing an important role in regulation, cellular defense and replication. Not only that, double NOS bonds have been identified and even found to be competitive in relation to the formation of disulfide bonds. This raises several questions about how this exotic bond comes to be, what are the intermediates involved in its formation and how it competes with other pathways of sulfide oxidation. With this objective in mind, we revisited our first proposed mechanism for the reaction with model electronic structure calculations, adding information about the reactivity with alternative reactive oxygen species and other potential competing products of oxidation. We present a network with more than 30 reactions which provides one of the most encompassing pictures for cysteine oxidation pathways to date.

         <title>[2+2+1+1] Cycloaddition for de novo Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized phenols can be easily obtained through formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO. The new benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation of up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from and complementary to those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.







Abstract
A unique benzannulation strategy for regioselective de novo synthesis of densely functionalized phenols is described. Through metal&#8208;mediated formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO, a series of densely functionalized phenols were obtained. The benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation up to five different substituents on a phenol ring.

         <title>A Porous Crystalline Nitrone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, has been synthesized for the first time via polycondensation reaction. The sorption analyses of COF&#8208;115 revealed a porosity of 1387&#8197;m2/g, and a superior potential for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications compared to their imine&#8208;based analogs. Finally, COF&#8208;115 was found to undergo a photochemical rearrangement to the corresponding amide&#8208;linked material.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, by combining N, N&#8242;, N&#8242;, N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1, 1, 2, 2&#8208;tetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;4, 1&#8208;diyl))tetrakis(hydroxylamine) and terephthaladehyde via a polycondensation reaction. The formation of the nitrone functionality was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 13C multi cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy of the 13C&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled COF&#8208;115 and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The permanent porosity of COF&#8208;115 was evaluated through low&#8208;pressure N2, CO2, and H2 sorption experiments. Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF&#8208;115 and the isoreticular imine&#8208;linked COF indicated a superior potential of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF&#8208;115 to the associated amide&#8208;linked material was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Pore Modulation of Hydrogen&#8722;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that combine functional sites, size control, and storage capability for targeting gas molecule capture is a novel and challenging venture. However, there is a lack of effective strategies to tune the hydrogen&#8722;bonded network to achieve high&#8208;performance HOFs. Here, a series of HOFs termed as HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;M (M = 1, 2, and 3) with different pore structures are obtained by introducing structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs) into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). These HOFs have distinct space configurations with pore channels ranging from discrete to continuous multi&#8208;dimensional. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals a rare diversity of hydrogen&#8722;bonding models dominated by SDAs. HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2, which forms a strong layered hydrogen&#8722;bonding network with ammonium (NH4+) through multiple carboxyl groups, has a suitable 1D "pearl&#8208;chain&#8221; channel for the selective capture of propylene (C3H6). At 298 K and 1 bar, the C3H6 storage density of HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 reaches 0.6 kg L&#8208;1, representing one of the best C3H6 storage materials, while offering a propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) selectivity of 12.2. Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ SCXRD provide a detailed analysis of the binding strength of C3H6 at different locations in the pearl&#8208;chain channel. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirm that HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 can effectively separate C3H6 from multi&#8208;mixtures.</dc:description>

Synergetic and orthogonal responses to temperature and excitation wavelength are achieved by confining the stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), leading to the preparation of a novel photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive spiropyran&#8208;diarylethene based material. Synergistic behavior of two photoswitches enables the study of stimuli&#8208;responsive resonance energy transfer as well as control of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, milestones required to advance optoelectronics development. Spectroscopic studies in combination with theoretical modeling revealed a nonlinear effect on the material electronic structure arising from the coordinative integration of photoresponsive molecules with distinct photoisomerization mechanisms. Thus, the reported work covers multivariable facets of not only fundamental aspects of photoswitch cooperativity, but also provides a pathway to modulate photophysics and electronics of multidimensional functional materials exhibiting thermo&#8208;photochromism.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) with Anti&#8208;Hook Effect for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimera&#160;(PROTAC) is an emerging pharmacological modality with innovated post&#8208;translational protein degradation capabilities. However, off&#8208;target induced unintended tissue effects and intrinsic &#8220;hook effect&#8221; hinder PROTAC biotechnology to be maturely developed. Herein, an intracellular fabricated nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) modality with a center&#8208;spoke degradation network for achieving efficient dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation in tumor is reported. The PROTAC precursors are triggered by higher GSH concentrations inside tumor cells, which subsequently in situ self&#8208;assemble into Nano&#8208;PROTACs through intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The fibrous Nano&#8208;PROTACs can form effective polynary complexes and E3 ligases degradation network with multi&#8208;binding sites, achieving dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221;. The generality and efficacy of Nano&#8208;PROTACs are validated by degrading variable protein of interest (POI) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (AR) in a wide&#8208;range dose&#8208;dependent manner with a 95 % degradation rate and long&#8208;lasting potency up to 72 h in vitro. Significantly, Nano&#8208;PROTACs achieve in vivo dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation up to 79 % and tumor growth inhibition in A549 and LNCap xenograft mice models, respectively. Taking advantages of in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy, the Nano&#8208;PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to promote precise clinical translational application of PROTAC.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Biomass Upgrading By A Ni&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst Featuring Passivation of Water Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electricity&#8208;driven organo&#8208;oxidations have shown an increasing potential recently. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the primary competitive reaction, especially under high current densities, which leads to low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the product and catalyst detachment from the electrode. Here, we report a bimetallic Ni&#8208;Cu electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni&#8208;Cu/NF) to passivate the OER process while the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is significantly enhanced. A current density of 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 can be achieved at 1.50 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, and both FE and yield keep close to 100% over a wide range of potentials. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that Cu doping impedes the OH* deprotonation to O* and hereby OER process is greatly passivated. Those instructive results provide a new approach to realizing highly efficient biomass upgrading by regulating the OER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis for the Isoquinoline&#8208;Forming Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the feasibility of atroposelective PIII/PV=O redox organocatalysis by the Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction. The formation of the isoquinoline heterocycle thereby enables the synthesis of a broad range of valuable atropisomers under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98:2 e.r. Readily prepared azido cinnamate substrates convert in high yield with stereocontrol by a chiral phosphine catalyst, which is regenerated using a silane reductant under Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis. The reaction provides access to diversified aryl isoquinolines, as well as benzoisoquinoline and naphthyridine atropisomers. The products are expeditiously transformed into N&#8208;oxides, naphthol and triaryl phosphine variants of prevalent catalysts and ligands. With dinitrogen release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, it is anticipated that atroposelective redox organocatalysis provide access to a multitude of aromatic heterocycles with precise control over their configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Centimeter&#8208;Size Single Crystals of Halide Perovskite Photoferroelectric Solid Solution with Ultrahigh Pyroelectricity Boosted Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoferroelectrics, especially emerging halide perovskite ferroelectrics, have motivated tremendous interests owing to their fascinating bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and cross&#8208;coupled functionalities. However, solid solutions of halide perovskite photoferroelectrics with controllable structure and enhanced performance are scarcely explored. Herein, through mixing cage cation, a homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8208;xPb2Br7 solid solution (PA, FA and MA are CH3CH2CH2NH3+, NH2CHNH2+ and CH3NH3+, 0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1) has been developed, which demonstrates tunable Curie temperature in a wide range of 263&#8208;323 K and excellent optoelectrical features. As the component adjusted to x = 0.7, the bulk crystal demonstrates ultrahigh pyroelectric coefficient up to 1.48 &#956;C cm&#8208;2 K&#8208;1 around room temperature. Strikingly, benefiting from the light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity and remarkable BPVE, a self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetector based solid solution crystals with boosted responsivity and detectivity over than 1300% has been achieved. This pioneering work sheds light on the exploration of photoferroelectric solid solutions towards high&#8208;performance photoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Syntheses of Polyarylopeptides Involving Large Molecular Motions: Frustrated Monomer Packing Leads to the Formation of Polymer Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the topochemical syntheses of three polyarylopeptides, wherein triazolylphenyl group is integrated into the backbone of peptide chains. We synthesized three different monomers having azide and arylacetylene as end&#8208;groups from glycine, L&#8208;alanine and L&#8208;valine. We crystallized these monomers and the crystal structures of two of them were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Due to the steric constraints, both of these monomers crystallized with two molecules, viz. conformers A and B, in the asymmetric unit. Consistently, in both cases, the A&#8208;conformers are antiparallelly &#960;&#8208;stacked and B&#8208;conformers are parallelly slip&#8208;stacked, exploiting weak interactions. Though the arrangements of molecules in the pristine crystals were unsuitable for topochemical reaction, upon heating, they undergo large motion inside the crystal lattice to reach a transient reactive orientation and thereby the self&#8208;sorted conformer stacks react to give a blend of triazole&#8208;linked polyarylopeptides having two different linkages. Due to the large molecular motion inside crystals, the product phase loses its crystallinity.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Achiral and Chiral Organic Ligands in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides to Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) could combine excellent optical properties and chirality, making them promising for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral 0D HMHs with efficient CPL have been rarely reported. Here, we propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and large dissymmetry factor (glum), by integrating achiral and chiral ligands into 0D HMHs. Specifically, three pairs of chiral 0D hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides are synthesized by combing achiral guanidine with three types of chiral methylbenzylammonium&#8208;based derivatives as the organic cations. These chiral 0D HMHs exhibit near&#8208;unity PLQY and large glum values up to around &#177;1 &#215; 10&#8208;2. The achiral guanidine ligand is not only essential to crystallize these hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides to achieve near&#8208;unity PLQYs, but also greatly enhances the chirality induction from organic ligands to inorganic units in these 0D HMHs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral zero-dimensional hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) could combine excellent optical properties and chirality, making them promising for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral 0D HMHs with efficient CPL have been rarely reported. Here, we propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and large dissymmetry factor (glum), by integrating achiral and chiral ligands into 0D HMHs. Specifically, three pairs of chiral 0D hybrid indium-antimony chlorides are synthesized by combing achiral guanidine with three types of chiral methylbenzylammonium-based derivatives as the organic cations. These chiral 0D HMHs exhibit near-unity PLQY and large glum values up to around &#177;1 &#215; 10-2. The achiral guanidine ligand is not only essential to crystallize these hybrid indium-antimony chlorides to achieve near-unity PLQYs, but also greatly enhances the chirality induction from organic ligands to inorganic units in these 0D HMHs. Furthermore, the choice of different chiral ligands can modify the strength of hydrogen bonding interactions in these 0D HMHs, to maximize their glum values.&#160; Overall, this study provides a robust way to realize efficient CPL in chiral HMHs, expanding their applications in chiroptical fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Electronic Structures of Iron Clusters through Orbital Rehybridization by&#160;Adjacent&#160;Single Copper Sites&#160;for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atom&#8211;cluster interaction has recently been exploited as an effective way to increase the performance of metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the rational design of such catalysts and understanding their structure&#8211;property correlations remain a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent metal (M)&#8208;N4 single atoms (SAs) could significantly improve the ORR performance of a well&#8208;screened Fe atomic cluster (AC) catalyst by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis. The DFT studies suggest that the Cu&#8208;N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O&#8208;O bond on the Fe AC active center, as well as optimize the release of OH* intermediates to accelerate the whole ORR kinetic. The depositing of Fe AC with Cu&#8208;N4 SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 eV in alkali and 0.80 eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8 mW cm&#8208;2 in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly&#8208;metallic centers for electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Promotes Acetylide Formation on MgO During Methane Coupling Under Non&#8208;Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A prototypical material for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is Li/MgO, for which Li is known to be essential as a dopant to obtain high C2&#160;selectivities. Herein, Li/MgO is demonstrated to be an effective catalyst for non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM). Moreover, the presence of Li is shown to favor the formation of magnesium acetylide (MgC2), while pure MgO promotes coke formation as evidenced by solid&#8208;state&#160;13C NMR, thus indicating that Li promotes C&#8211;C bond formation. Metadynamic simulations of the carbon mobility in MgC2&#160;and Li2C2&#160;at the density functional theory (DFT) level show that carbon easily diffuses as a C2&#160;unit at 1000&#176;C.

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Molybdenum Complexes Bearing PNP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligand toward Ammonia Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We newly designed and prepared a novel molybdenum complex bearing a 4&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand, based on the bond dissociation free energies of the N&#8722;H bonds in molybdenum&#8208;imide complexes bearing various substituted PNP pincer ligands. The complex worked as an excellent catalyst toward ammonia formation, where up to 3580 equivalents of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst.







Abstract
We newly designed and prepared a novel molybdenum complex bearing a 4&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand, based on the bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in molybdenum&#8208;imide complexes bearing various substituted pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands. The complex worked as an excellent catalyst toward ammonia formation from the reaction of an atmospheric pressure of dinitrogen with samarium diiodide as a reductant and water as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions, where up to 3580 equivalents of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. The catalytic activity was significantly improved by one order of magnitude larger than that observed when using the complex before modification.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life, High&#8208;Rate Rechargeable Lithium Batteries Based on Soluble Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) Disulfide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosulfides are promising candidates as cathode materials for the development of electric vehicles and energy storage systems due to their low&#8208;cost and high capacity properties. However, they generally suffer from slow kinetics because of the large rearrangement of S&#8208;S bonds and structural degradation upon cycling in batteries. In this paper, we reveal that bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym2S2) can be a high&#8208;rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. Benefiting from the superdelocalization of pyrimidyl group, the extra electrons prefer to be localized on the &#960;* (pyrimidyl group) than &#963;* (S&#8208;S bond) molecular orbitals initially, generating the anion&#8208;like intermedia of [Pym2S2]2&#8208; and thus decreasing the dissociation energy of the S&#8208;S bond. It makes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociative electron transfer depleted, therefore the lithium half cell exhibits 3000 cycles at 5 C. This study provides a distinct pathway for the design of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life organic cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning C1/C2 Selectivity of CO2 Electrochemical Reduction over in&#8208;Situ Evolved CuO/SnO2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterostructured oxides with versatile active sites, as a class of efficient catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER), are prone to undergo structure reconstruction under working conditions, thus bringing challenges to understanding the reaction mechanism and rationally designing catalysts. Herein, we for the first time elucidate the structural reconstruction of CuO/SnO2 under electrochemical potentials and reveal the intrinsic relationship between CO2ER product selectivity and the in&#8208;situ evolved heterostructures. At &#8208;0.85 VRHE, the CuO/SnO2 evolves to Cu2O/SnO2 with high selectivity to HCOOH (Faradaic efficiency of 54.81%). Mostly interestingly, it is reconstructed to Cu/SnO2&#8208;x at &#8208;1.05 VRHE with significantly improved Faradaic efficiency to ethanol of 39.8%. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of Cu/SnO2&#8208;x favors the formation of *CO and decreases the energy barrier of C&#8208;C coupling, leading to high selectivity to ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomization&#8208;Induced High Intrinsic Activity of a Biocompatible MgAl&#8208;LDH Supported Ru Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Efficient Radicals Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient nanozymes to mimic natural enzymes for scavenging reactive radicals remains a significant challenge owing to the insufficient activity of conventional nanozymes. Herein, we report a novel Ru single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAE), featuring atomically dispersed Ru atoms on a biocompatible MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Ru1/LDH). The prepared Ru1/LDH SAE shows high intrinsic peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, which 20 times outperforms the Ru nanoclusters (NCs) nanozyme and surpasses most SAEs. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the high intrinsic POD&#8208;like activity of Ru1/LDH can be attributed to a heterolytic path of H2O2 dissociation on the single Ru sites, which requires lower free energy (0.43 eV) compared to the homolytic path dissociation on Ru NC (0.63 eV). In addition, the Ru1/LDH SAE shows excellent multiple free radicals scavenging ability, including superoxide anion radical (O2&#183;&#8208;), hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH), nitric oxide radical (NO&#183;) and 2, 2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH&#183;). Given the advantages of Ru1/LDH with high enzymatic activities, biosafety, and ease to scale&#8208;up, it paves the way for exploring SAEs in the practical biological immunity system.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient nanozymes to mimic natural enzymes for scavenging reactive radicals remains a significant challenge owing to the insufficient activity of conventional nanozymes. Herein, we report a novel Ru single-atom nanozyme (SAE), featuring atomically dispersed Ru atoms on a biocompatible MgAl-layered double hydroxide (Ru1/LDH). The prepared Ru1/LDH SAE shows high intrinsic peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic activity, which 20 times outperforms the Ru nanoclusters (NCs) nanozyme and surpasses most SAEs. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the high intrinsic POD-like activity of Ru1/LDH can be attributed to a heterolytic path of H2O2 dissociation on the single Ru sites, which requires lower free energy (0.43 eV) compared to the homolytic path dissociation on Ru NC (0.63 eV). In addition, the Ru1/LDH SAE shows excellent multiple free radicals scavenging ability, including superoxide anion radical (O2&#183;-), hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH), nitric oxide radical (NO&#183;) and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH&#183;). Given the advantages of Ru1/LDH with high enzymatic activities, biosafety, and ease to scale-up, it paves the way for exploring SAEs in the practical biological immunity system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reaction&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Selective Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 System for Dual&#8208;Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR system&#8208;assisted immunotherapy is an attractive option in cancer therapy. However, its efficacy is still less than expected due to the limitations in delivering the CRISPR system to target cancer cells. Here, we report a new CRISPR/Cas9 tumor&#8208;targeting delivery strategy based on bioorthogonal reactions for dual&#8208;targeted cancer immunotherapy. First, selective in vivo metabolic labeling of cancer and activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved simultaneously through tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;biodegradable hollow manganese dioxide (H&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;platform. Subsequently, CRISPR/Cas9 system&#8208;loaded liposome was accumulated within the modified tumor tissue through in vivo click chemistry, resulting in the loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) and further sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, our strategy provides a modular platform for precise gene editing in vivo and exhibits potent antitumor response by boosting innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.</dc:description>

         <title>Materials Space&#8208;Tectonics: Atomic&#8208;level Compositional and Spatial Control Methodologies for Synthesis of Future Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review proposes a novel methodology, materials space&#8208;tectonics, as a game&#8208;changing concept of materials synthesis. Many reactions occur at surfaces and interfaces, making the formation of well&#8208;designed surface and interfacial structures a crucial matter. To establish both a bulk material body (i.e., framework) and an empty void space, careful consideration is required to &#8220;nano&#8208;architect&#8221; the space. Traditional porous materials, such as mesoporous silicas, zeolites, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), lack advanced cooperative functionalities due to their largely monotonous pore geometries and limited conductivities. To overcome these limitations and create functional structures with surface&#8208;specific functions, &#8220;Materials space&#8208;tectonics&#8221; is proposed as a game&#8208;changing methodology for future materials synthesis. This review summarizes recent examples of materials synthesis according to the synthesis of building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization. It also provides practical tips for successfully implementing materials syntheses and showcase various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances from the viewpoint of practical applications. Finally, the potential integration of materials space&#8208;tectonics with emerging technologies such as materials informatics is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Control over Reversible Single Chain Nanoparticle Folding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a class of single chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) that respond to visible light (&#955;max = 415 nm) with complete unfolding from their compact structure into linear chain analogues. The initial folding is achieved by a simple esterification reaction of the polymer backbone constituted of acrylic acid and polyethylene glycol carrying monomer units, introducing bimane moieties, which allow for the photochemical unfolding reversing the ester&#8208;bond formation. The compaction and the light driven unfolding proceed cleanly and both are readily followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) monitoring the change in the hydrodynamic radius (RH). Importantly, the folding reaction and the light&#8208;induced unfolding are reversible, supported by the high conversion of the photo cleavage. As the unfolding reaction occurs in aqueous systems, the system holds promise for controlling the unfolding of SCNPs in biological environments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) switches are powerful tools for&#160;in situ&#160;cell purification, especially for cells derived from stem cells. However, the&#160;retention&#160;effectiveness of the target&#160;cells&#160;is limited by&#160;the&#160;leaky expression of toxic protein. The&#160;elimination efficiency of non&#8208;target cells is also constrained due to the lack of signal amplification. In this study, we designed a novel approach that uses synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular marker molecule information into spatially controlled extracellular toxic assembly formation. The approach bypasses the use of toxic protein to&#160;ensure&#160;high target cell recovery effectiveness. Meanwhile, the marker molecule information is amplified at multiple levels to ensure high non&#8208;target cell elimination effectiveness. Our approach can be tailored to meet various&#160;in situ&#160;cell purification needs, promising high&#8208;quality&#160;in situ&#160;cell purification for a wide range of biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing polymeric systems with ultra&#8208;high optical activity is instrumental in the pursuit of smart artificial chiroptical materials, including the fundamental understanding of structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relations. Herein, we report on a diacetylene (DA) moiety flanked by chiral D and L&#8208;FF dipeptide methyl esters that exhibits efficient topochemical photopolymerization in the solid phase to furnish polydiacetylene (PDA) with desired control over the chiroptical properties. The doping of the achiral gold nanoparticles provides plasmonic interaction with the PDAs to render asymmetric shape of the circular dichroism bands. With the judicious design of chiral amino acid ligand appended to AuNPs, we demonstrate the first example of selective chiral amplification mediated by stereo&#8208;structural matching of the polymer&#8208;plasmonic AuNP hybrid pairs. Such ordered self&#8208;assembly aided by topochemical polymerization in peptide&#8208;tethered PDA provides a smart strategy to produce soft responsive materials for applications in chiral photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Local Charge Symmetry of Iron Single Atoms for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of nitrate pollutants into value&#8208;added ammonia is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the development of electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) has been hampered by high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency. Here we develop an iron single&#8208;atom catalyst coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe&#8208;N/P&#8208;C) as a NO3&#8208;RR catalyst electrode. Owing to the tuning effect of phosphorus atoms on breaking local charge symmetry of the single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom catalyst, it facilitates the adsorption of nitrate ions and enrichment of some key reaction intermediates during the NO3&#8208;RR process. The Fe&#8208;N/P&#8208;C catalyst exhibits 90.3% ammonia Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 17980 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1, greatly outperforming the reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, operando SR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy measurements reveal the reaction pathway based on key intermediates observed under different applied potentials and reaction durations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the optimized free energy of NO3&#8208;RR intermediates is ascribed to the asymmetric atomic interface configuration, which achieves the optimal electron density distribution. This work demonstrates the enhanced function of heteroatom doping on single atoms for NO3&#8208;RR, and provides an effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts in different electrochemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic and Cell&#8208;Permeable Rhodamine Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Live&#8208;Cell Protein Labeling in Bioimaging and Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of fluorescence microscopy techniques has opened up new opportunities for visualizing proteins and unraveling their functions in living biological systems. Small&#8208;molecule organic dyes, which possess exceptional photophysical properties, small size, and high photostability, serve as powerful fluorescent reporters in protein imaging. However, achieving high&#8208;contrast live&#8208;cell labeling of target proteins with conventional organic dyes remains a considerable challenge in bioimaging and biosensing due to their inadequate cell permeability and high background signal. Over the past decade, a novel generation of fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable dyes has been developed, which have substantially improved live&#8208;cell protein labeling by fine&#8208;tuning the reversible equilibrium between a cell&#8208;permeable, nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion (protein&#8208;bound) of rhodamines. In this review, we present the mechanism and design strategies of these fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamines, as well as their applications in bioimaging and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Block Copolymers from Tricarboxamides. Biasing Co&#8208;assembly by the Incorporation of Pyridine Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a series of triangular&#8208;shape tricarboxamides endowed with three picolin or nicotin (compounds&#160;2&#160;and&#160;3) or just one nicotine unit (compound&#160;4) is reported and their self&#8208;assembling features investigated. The pyridine rings make compounds&#160;2&#8208;4&#160;electronically complementary with our previously reported OPETA&#160;1&#160;to form supramolecular copolymers.&#160;C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide&#160;2&#160;forms highly stable intramolecular five&#8208;membered pseudocycles that impedes its supramolecular polymerization into&#160;poly&#8208;2&#160;and the co&#8208;assembly with&#160;1&#160;to yield copolymer&#160;poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2.

The copolymer&#160;poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3&#160;can only be obtained by a previous complete disassembly of the constitutive homopolymers in CHCl3. Helical&#160;poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3&#160;arises in a process involving the transfer of the helicity from racemic&#160;poly&#8208;1&#160;to&#160;poly&#8208;3, and the amplification of asymmetry from chiral&#160;poly&#8208;3&#160;to&#160;poly&#8208;1.

         <title>Platinum and Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria as Dual&#8208;Active Sites for Efficient Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction faces the following obstacles: low activity and unsatisfactory selectivity. Herein, the dual&#8208;active sites of platinum (Pt) clusters and frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods (Ptcluster/PN&#8208;CeO2) provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost the highly performed RWGS reaction at low temperatures. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that Pt clusters can effectively activate and dissociate H2. The FLP sites, instead of the metal and support interfaces, not only enhance the strong adsorption and activation of CO2, but also significantly weaken CO adsorption on FLP to facilitate CO release and suppress the CH4 formation. With the help of hydrogen spillover from Pt to PN&#8208;CeO2, the Ptcluster/PN&#8208;CeO2 catalysts achieved a CO yield of 29.6%, which was very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium yield of CO (29.8%) at 350 &#176;C. Meanwhile, the Ptcluster/PN&#8208;CeO2 catalysts delivered a large turnover frequency of 8720 h&#8208;1. Moreover, Ptcluster/PN&#8208;CeO2 was stably and continuously operated for at least 840 h. This finding provides a promising path towards the utilization of RWGS reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Umpolung of Tertiary Amide Enabled by Catalytic Reductive Stannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivity umpolung is an important concept in organic chemistry. Established reactivity umpolung mainly focuses on the aldehyde and umpolung of amide carbonyl group is not known. In this report, we describe a process to obtain the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide. This process hinges on the efficient reductive stannylation catalyzed by Ir/silane and facile Sn&#8208;Li exchange. By leveraging this umpolung reactivity, drug Fluoxetine was derivatized to 12 different analogues via reacting with various electrophiles and four biologically active molecules were prepared concisely. This unlocked umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide is expected to find applications to synthesize complex amines from amides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy for Controlling the Polymerizations of Thiyl Radical Propagation by RAFT Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to extend the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be regulated by existing controlled methods would be highly desirable, yet remained very challenging to achieve because the thiyl radicals still cannot be reversibly controlled by these methods. In this article, we reported a novel strategy that could enable the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides, wherein propagating specie is thiyl radical, to be controlled by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents. The key to the success of this strategy is the propagating thiyl radical can undergo desulfurization with isocyanide and generate a stabilized alkyl radical for reversible control. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions allowed good control over the polymerization, leading to the formation of polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures, exemplified by the radical block copolymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides and vinyl monomers and the incorporation of sequence&#8208;defined segments into the polymer backbone. This work represents a significant step toward directly enabling the polymerizations of heteroatom&#8208;centered radical propagation to be regulated by existing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Lewis acid&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;divergent Bissilylation of Alkynoates: Scope, Mechanism, and Origin of Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed bissilylation reactions of alkynes with disilane reagents have become one of the most straightforward and efficient protocols to rapidly produce structurally diverse alkenyl silicon derivatives. In these reactions, the utilization of unsymmetrical disilane reagents provided the possibilities for reactivity enhancement as well as the synthetic merits in contrast to symmetrical disilane reagents. However, a major yet challenging objective is achieving precise control over the selectivity including the regioselectivity and the&#160;cis/trans&#8208;selectivity. Herein we realized the first divergent bissilylation of alkynoates with our developed air&#8208;stable disilane reagent TMDQ by means of synergistic Pd/Lewis acid catalytic system. The catalytic system precisely dictates the selectivity, resulting in the divergent synthesis of 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes. The power of these 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes serving as the key synthetic intermediates has been clearly demonstrated by rapid construction of diverse motifs and densely functionalized biologically active compounds. In addition, the origins of the switchable selectivities were well elucidated by experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism and were mainly attributed to different ligand steric effects, the use of the specific disilane reagent TMDQ and the different coordination modes of different Lewis acid with alkynoates.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of Heptacoordinated Fe(III) Bifunctional Complexes for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this research, highly efficient heterogeneous bifunctional (BF) electrocatalysts (ECs) have been strategically designed by Fe coordination (CR) complexes, [Fe2L2(H2O)2Cl2] (C1) and [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O) (C2) where the high seven CR number synergistically modifies the electronic environment of the Fe centre for facilitation of H2O electrolysis. The electronic status of Fe and its adjacent atomic sites have been further modified by the replacement of &#8208;Cl&#8208; in C1 by &#8208;SO42&#8208; in C2. Interestingly, compared to C1, the O&#8208;S&#8208;O bridged C2 reveals superior&#160;BF&#160;activity with extremely low overpotential (h) at 10&#160;mAcm&#8211;2 (140 mVOER, 62 mVHER) and small Tafel slope (120.9 mVdec&#8208;1OER, 45.8 mVdec&#8208;1HER). Additionally, C2 also facilitates a high&#8208;performance alkaline H2O electrolyzer with cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mAcm&#8211;2 and exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term stability. Thus, exploration of the intrinsic properties of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based ECs opens up a new approach to the rational design of a wide range of molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Pressure Carbonylation of Benzyl Carbonates and Carbamates for Applications in 13C Isotope Labeling and Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an oxygen atom deletion strategy via sequential Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative carbonylation of carbonates and carbamates to afford esters and amides is reported. Operating under low pressures (near stoichiometric or substoichiometric), either 13C labeled products are accessed or a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that CO2 formed upon decarboxylation can be reduced in situ and reincorporated as CO is shown.







Abstract
Herein, we report a methodology to access isotopically labeled esters and amides from carbonates and carbamates employing an oxygen deletion strategy. This methodology utilizes a decarboxylative carbonylation approach for isotope labeling with near stoichiometric, ex situ generated 12C, or 13C carbon monoxide. This reaction is characterized by its broad scope, functional group tolerance, and high yields, which is showcased with the synthesis of structurally complex molecules. A complementary method that operates by the catalytic in situ generation of CO via the reduction of CO2 liberated during decarboxylation has also been developed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach that CO2&#8208;derived compounds can be converted to CO&#8208;containing frameworks. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the catalytic steps which highlight the impact of ligand choice to overcome challenges associated with low&#8208;pressure carbonylation methodologies, along with rational for the development of future methodologies.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphido Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Phosphines to Cyclopropenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes that occurs at ambient temperature is reported. It proceeds through a copper&#8208;phosphido intermediate while various cyclopropylphosphines can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) process. Expeirmental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
We describe a copper catalyst that promotes the addition of phosphines to cyclopropenes at ambient temperature. A range of cyclopropylphosphines bearing different steric and electronic properties can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DyKAT) process. A combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study supports an elementary step featuring insertion of a CuI&#8208;phosphido into a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. Density functional theory calculations reveal migratory insertion as the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, followed by a syn&#8208;protodemetalation.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Control of Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light Transparency Based on Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Association of Tetrathiafulvalene Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble consisting of the solid form of the tetrathiafulvalene radical cation and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide showed rapid and reversible changes in short&#8208;wave infrared light (&gt;1000&#8197;nm) transparency upon weak external stimulation. This behavior originated from the conversion of the association structures of the radical cation from columnar arrangements of &#960;&#8208;dimers into isolated &#960;&#8208;dimers.







Abstract
The light&#8208;transmissive properties of a solid&#8208;state tetrathiafulvalene radical cation&#8208;bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 1&#8208;C5&#8901;+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NTf2&#8722;, underwent instantaneous changes in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region (1000&#8211;2500&#8197;nm) upon exposure to solvent vapor or the application of mechanostress at room temperature. The initial solid state of 1&#8208;C5&#8901;+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NTf2&#8722; exhibited strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR; 700&#8211;1000&#8197;nm) and SWIR regions, whereas the absorption in the SWIR region was significantly diminished in the stimulated state induced by dichloromethane vapor. Upon cessation of vapor stimulation, the solid state spontaneously and promptly reverted to its original state, characterized by absorption bands in the NIR/SWIR region. Moreover, the SWIR absorption was absent upon the application of mechanical stress using a steel spatula. The reversal was fast and occurred within 10&#8197;s. These changes were visualized using a SWIR imaging camera under 1450&#8208;nm light irradiation. Experimental investigations demonstrated that the transparency to the SWIR light in the solid states was modulated through significant structural transformations of the associated radical cations, with transitions between columnar and isolated &#960;&#8208;dimer structures under ambient and stimulated conditions, respectively.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Aided Thermoelectric Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the Soret effect of protons and the classical proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (H2Q) in hydrogels, an overall and giant thermoelectric performance including the thermopower, ionic conductivity, power factor, ionic Figure of merit is achieved. Above all, an energy&#8208;storage function is achieved by the BQ and H2Q redox couple after the removal of temperature difference and the mechanism is evaluated.







Abstract
Low&#8208;grade heat is ubiquitous in the environment and its thermoelectric conversion by the ionic conductors remains a challenge because of the low efficiency and poor sustainability. Here we demonstrate that the thermoelectric performances can be boosted by combining the Soret effect of protons and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction of benzoquinone and hydroquinone in hydrogels. An overall enhancement of thermopower (25.9&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1), power factor (5&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2), figure of merit (&gt;2.4) and continuity of power output is achieved. Moreover, an energy&#8208;storage function can be achieved by the redox couple, and a retained power output of 27.7&#8201;%, or 14&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2 for more than 3&#8197;hours is obtained by the re&#8208;balance of PCET reactants in the hydrogel after the removal of the temperature gradient.

         <title>Redox Reorganization: Aluminium Promoted 1,5&#8208;Hydride Shifts Allow the Controlled Synthesis of Multisubstituted Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of multisubstituted cyclohexenes has been achieved from tetrahydropyrans (easily accessible via many synthetic approaches). The process operates via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation mediated by simple aluminium reagents (e.g. Al2O3), enabling the synthesis of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) bearing substituents at each position around the cyclohexene ring with high levels of chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity.@DonohoeGroup







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of cyclohexenes has been achieved from easily accessible tetrahydropyrans via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation. We discovered that readily available aluminium reagents, e.g. Al2O3 or Al(OtBu)3 are essential for this process, promoting the 1,5&#8208;hydride shift with complete regio&#8208; and enantiospecificity (in stark contrast to results obtained under basic conditions). The mild conditions, coupled with multiple methods available to access the tetrahydropyran starting materials makes this a versatile method with exceptional functional group tolerance. A wide range of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) have been prepared, many in enantiopure form, showing our ability to selectively install a substituent at each position around the newly forged cyclohexene ring. Experimental and computational studies revealed that aluminium serves a dual role in facilitating the hydride shift, activating both the alkoxide nucleophile and the electrophilic carbonyl group.

         <title>Electroreductive Desulfurative Transformations with Thioethers as Alkyl Radical Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl alkyl thioethers are an underutilized class of alkyl radical precursors that are demonstrated to outperform their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues under electroreductive conditions. Single electron transfer results in C&#8722;S bond cleavage and alkyl radicals that may react in C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond forming events or undergo radical&#8208;polar crossover, followed by protonation or carboxylation to furnish alkanes or arylacetic acids.







Abstract
Thioethers are highly prevalent functional groups in organic compounds of natural and synthetic origin but remain remarkably underexplored as starting materials in desulfurative transformations. As such, new synthetic methods are highly desirable to unlock the potential of the compound class. In this vein, electrochemistry is an ideal tool to enable new reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient use of aryl alkyl thioethers as alkyl radical precursors in electroreductive transformations, along with mechanistic details. The transformations proceed with complete selectivity for C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, orthogonal to that of established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron routes. We showcase a hydrodesulfurization protocol with broad functional group tolerance, the first example of desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation in Giese&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling and the first protocol for electrocarboxylation of synthetic relevance with thioethers as starting materials. Finally, the compound class is shown to outcompete their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues as alkyl radical precursors, demonstrating their synthetic potential for future desulfurative transformations in a one&#8208;electron manifold.

         <title>Association of Radical Chemistry with LanD Flavoprotein Activity for C&#8208;Terminal Macrocyclization of a Ribosomal Peptide by Formation of an Unsaturated Thioether Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the C&#8208;terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce a reactive enethiol. This enzyme activity can couple with radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;3&#8208;carbamoylcysteine, by conjugation of the enethiol with C&#946; of the Asn residue in the C&#8208;terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization.







Abstract
LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the C&#8208;terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce an enethiol. This enethiol is highly reactive and can be coupled with an upstream dehydroamino acid through Michael addition to form S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl](3&#8208;methyl)cysteine, an unsaturated thioether residue known to be characteristic of an array of C&#8208;terminally macrocyclized, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Based on a two&#8208;stage bioinformatics mining of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) related to C&#8208;terminal Cys processing, we report herein that LanD activity can couple with radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;3&#8208;carbamoylcysteine, by conjugating the resultant enethiol with C&#946; of the Asn residue in the C&#8208;terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization. This study furthers our understanding of the variety of PTMs involved in creating the structure diversity of macrocyclic RiPPs.

         <title>Multiple Dynamic Bonds&#8208;Driven Integrated Cathode/Polymer Electrolyte for Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated cathode/ultrathin polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries was constructed driven by multiple dynamic bonds in a dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomer (DSICE), thus achieving minimum thickness of pure polymer electrolyte and maximum compatibility of the solid electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interface at the molecular level. The well&#8208;constructed cells present superior cyling stability, excellent flexibility and safety.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as the promising higher&#8208;energy and improved&#8208;safety energy&#8208;storage systems. Nevertheless, the electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial issues due to the limited solid physical contact lead to discontinuous interfacial charge transport and large interfacial resistance, thereby suffering from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we construct an integrated cathode/polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs under the action of polymer chains exchange and recombination originating from multiple dynamic bonds in our well&#8208;designed dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers (DSICE) molecular structure. The DSICE acts as polymer electrolytes with excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical properties, achieving the ultrathin pure polymer electrolyte thickness (12&#8197;&#956;m). Notably, the DSICE also functions as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathode binders with enhanced adhesive capability. Such well&#8208;constructed Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE cells generate delicate electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial contact at the molecular level, providing continuous Li+ transport pathways and promoting uniform Li+ deposition, further delivering superior long&#8208;term charge/discharge stability (&gt;600&#8197;cycles, Coulombic efficiency, &gt;99.8&#8201;%) and high capacity retention (80&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of mechanochemistry enabled the rapid in situ generation of Grignard reagents, thereby overcoming the longstanding limitations of the Magnesium&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction in solution.







Abstract
Organomagnesium halides (Grignard reagents) are essential carbanionic building blocks widely used in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with various electrophiles. In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, and C&#8722;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent&#8208;free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.

Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg-mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, and C&#8722;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent-free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled NiII&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylarylation of Alkenes with Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylarylation of alkenes has been realized with highly efficient and excellent regioselectivity employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant and hydroxyl source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#947;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols, &#947;&#8208;aminoalcohols, and 1,3&#8208;diols in high yields.







Abstract
The use of molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant in transition metal catalyzed oxidative process is an appealing and challenging task in organic synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylarylation of unactivated alkenes enabled by a &#946;&#8208;diketone ligand with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant and hydroxyl source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#947;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols, &#947;&#8208;aminoalcohols, and 1,3&#8208;diols in high yields. The synthetic value of this methodology was demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of two bioactive compounds, (&#177;)&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyl citreochlorol and tea catechin metabolites M4.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions Enforce Conformation in Switchable and Water&#8208;Soluble Diketopiperazine&#8208;Pyridine Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a diketopiperazine&#8208;based foldamer design that maintains its conformation in challenging environments, making it a promising platform for future therapeutic applications. The conformation is enforced by juxtaposition of dipolar repulsion and torsional strain interactions. The foldamers show dynamic switching capabilities, responding to external stimuli and paving the way for new applications in mimicking biological systems.







Abstract
To reach their potential as mimics of the dynamic molecules present in biological systems, foldamers must be designed to display stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. Here we report such a foldamer architecture based on alternating pyridine&#8208;diketopiperazine linkers. Epimerization is conveniently prevented through a copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling protocol. The compounds&#8217; native unswitched conformation is first discovered in the solid and solution state. The foldamers can be solubilized in DMSO and pH&#8197;9.5 buffer, retaining conformational control to a large degree. Lastly, dynamic switching is demonstrated through treatment with acid, leading to behaviour we describe as stimulus&#8208;responsive sidechain reconfiguration.

         <title>Synthesis of Cobalt&#8208;Tin and &#8208;Lead Tetrylidynes&#8212;Reactivity Study of the Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrylidynes featuring a triple bond between cobalt and tin or lead have been synthesized via a substitution reaction between anionic cobalt complex [Co(PMe3)4]&#8722; and halides of tin and lead. The cobalt stannylidyne adds two equivalents of water to give a cobalt dihydride moiety and tin dihydroxide unit. In reaction with carbon dioxide the stannylidyne forms a cobalt carbonyl complex featuring a carbonate ligand coordinated at tin.







Abstract
Tetrylidynes [TbbSn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1&#8201;a) and [TbbPb&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (2) (Tbb=2,6&#8208;[CH(SiMe3)2]2&#8208;4&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)C6H2) are accessed for the first time via a substitution reaction between [Na(OEt2)][Co(PMe3)4] and [Li(thf)2][TbbEBr2] (E=Sn, Pb). Following an alternative procedure the stannylidyne [Ar*Sn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by hydrogen atom abstraction using AIBN from the paramagnetic hydride complex [Ar*SnH=Co(PMe3)3] (4) (AIBN=azobis(isobutyronitrile)). The stannylidyne 1&#8201;a adds two equivalents of water to yield the dihydroxide [TbbSn(OH)2CoH2(PMe3)3] (5). In reaction of the stannylidyne 1&#8201;a with CO2 a product of a redox reaction [TbbSn(CO3)Co(CO)(PMe3)3] (6) was isolated. Protonation of the tetrylidynes occurs at the cobalt atom to give the metalla&#8208;stanna vinyl cation [TbbSn=CoH(PMe3)3][BArF4] (7&#8201;a) [ArF=C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2]. The analogous germanium and tin cations [Ar*E=CoH(PMe3)3][BArF4] (E=Ge 9, Sn 7&#8201;b) (Ar*=C6H3(2,6&#8208;Trip)2, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3) were also obtained by oxidation of the paramagnetic complexes [Ar*EH=Co(PMe3)3] (E=Ge 3, Sn 4), which were synthesized by substitution of a PMe3 ligand of [Co(PMe3)4] by a hydridoylene (Ar*EH) unit.

         <title>Cl2&#8901;&#8722; Mediates Direct and Selective Conversion of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds into Aldehydes/Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine polymer facilitates effective conversion of O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl2&#8901;&#8722; in the aqueous phase. Cl2&#8901;&#8722;, with a longer lifetime, transfers into organic phase and activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates by successive hydrogen abstraction and chlorination. These unstable intermediates hydrolyze into either aldehydes or ketones with higher selectivity than that of benzyl dichloride.







Abstract
Developing new reactive pathway to activate inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds for valuable oxygenated products remains a challenge. We prepared a series of triazine conjugated organic polymers to photoactivate C&#8722;H into aldehyde/ketone via O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl2&#8901;&#8722;. Experiment results showed Cl2&#8901;&#8722; could successively activate C(sp3)&#8722;H more effectively than Cl&#8901; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily, when compared with typical stable dichlorinated complexes, avoiding chlorinated by&#8208;product generation. Moreover, an integrated two&#8208;phase system in an acid solution strengthened the Cl2&#8901;&#8722; mediated process and inhibited product overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94&#8197;mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5&#8201;%. This work presents a facile and efficient approach for selective conversion of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using Cl2&#8901;&#8722;.

We prepared a series of triazine conjugated organic polymers to photoactivate C&#8722;H into aldehyde/ketone via O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Experiment results showed Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; could successively activate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H more effectively than Cl&#8901; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily, when compared with typical stable dichlorinated complexes, avoiding chlorinated by-product generation. Moreover, an integrated two-phase system in an acid solution strengthened the Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; mediated process and inhibited product overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94&#8197;mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5&#8201;%. This work presents a facile and efficient approach for selective conversion of inert C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds using Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Alkylureido Imidazole Artificial Water Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;alkylureido&#8208;imidazoles have been used to construct bis&#8208;alkylureido&#8208;imidazole presenting increased water transport and lower H+ translocation activities than monosubstituted I&#8208;quartets across lipid bilayers. These studies shed light on potential mechanisms of biological proton/water translocation and inspire novel designs for engineering artificial water channels membranes.







Abstract
Nature creates aquaporins to effectively transport water, rejecting all ions including protons. Aquaporins (AQPs) has brought inspiration for the development of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). Imidazole&#8208;quartet (I&#8208;quartet) was the first AWC that enabled to self&#8208;assemble a tubular backbone for rapid water and proton permeation with total ion rejection. Here, we report the discovery of bis&#8208;alkylureido imidazole compounds, which outperform the I&#8208;quartets by exhibiting &#8776;3&#8197;times higher net and single channel permeabilities (107 H2O/s/channel) and a &#8776;2&#8211;3&#8197;times lower proton conductance. The higher water conductance regime is associated to the high partition of more hydrophobic bis&#8208;alkylureido channels in the membrane and to their pore sizes, experiencing larger fluctuations, leading to an increase in the number of water molecules in the channel, with decreasing H&#8208;bonding connectivity. This new class of AWCs will open new pathways toward scalable membranes with enhanced water transport performances.

         <title>Polymers of intrinsic microporosity solid ion conductors for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and superior stability are considered to be a key technology for the safe operation of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, current SSEs are incapable of meeting the requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here we report a general strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance SSEs by engineering polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). Taking advantage of the interconnected ion pathways generated from the ionizable groups, high ionic conductivity (1.06&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) is achieved for the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs. The mechanically strong (50.0 MPa) and non&#8208;flammable SSEs combine the two superiorities of outstanding Li+ conductivity and electrochemical stability, which can restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short&#8208;circuiting even after more than 2200 h cycling. Benefiting from the rational design of SSEs, PIMs&#8208;based SSEs Li&#8211;metal batteries can achieve good cycling performance and superior feasibility in a series of withstand abuse tests including bending, cutting, and penetration. Moreover, the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs endow high specific capacity (11307 mAh g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (247 cycles) for solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;O2 batteries. The PIMs&#8208;based SSEs present a powerful strategy for enabling safe operation of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;Oriented&#160;Polyaniline&#8208;Supported Palladium Nanoclusters for Reductive Homocoupling
of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing well&#8208;defined structures and desired properties for porous organic polymer (POP) supported catalysts by controlling their composition, size, and morphology is of great significance. Herein, we report a preparation of polyaniline (PANI) supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable of the structure and morphology. The protocol involves the introduction of MnO2 with different crystal structures (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#949;) serving as both reaction templates and oxidants. MnO2 selectively oxidizes the aniline to polyaniline with diverse regular distribution of benzene and quinone, thus leading to the Pd/PANI catalyst growth mode which prominently impacts the charge transfer between Pd and PANI, as well as the dispersion of metal NPs. In particular, Pd/&#949;&#8208;PANI greatly improves the turnover frequency (TOF), up to 88.3 h&#8208;1,in the reductive coupling of the furfural derivatives to potential bio&#8208;based plasticizers. Systematic characterizations reveal the unique oxidation state of the support in the Pd/&#949;&#8208;PANI catalyst and coordination mode of Pd that drives the formation of highly dispersed Pd nanoclusters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the more electron rich Pd/PANI catalyst has the lower energy barrier in the oxidative addition step, which favors the C&#8208;C coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Polysulfide Conversion Catalysis and Reversible Anode Operation by A Single Cathode Modifier in Li&#8208;Metal Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two major issues confronting the commercialization of rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reactions on the cathode and inadequate lithium deposition/stripping reversibility on the anode. They are commonly mitigated with additives designed specifically for the anode and the cathode individually. Here, we report the use of a single cathode modifier, In2Se3, which can effectively catalyse the polysulfide reactions on the cathode, and also improve the reversibility of Li deposition and removal on the anode through a LiInS2/LiInSe2 containing solid electrolyte interface formed in&#8208;situ by the Se and In ions dissolved in the electrolyte. The amounts of dissolved Se and In are small relative to the amount of In2Se3 administered. The benefits of using this single modification approach were verified in Li&#8208;metal anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;S batteries with a Li2S loading of 4 mg cm&#8208;2 and a low electrolyte/Li2S ratio of 7.5 &#181;L mg&#8208;1. The resulting battery showed 60% capacity retention after 160 cycles at the 0.2 C rate and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.27%, comparing very well with recent studies using separate electrode modifiers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane Tension&#8208;Responsive Mechanosensitive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a biomimetic DNA nanomachine inspired by the natural PIEZO channel. This nanomachine incorporates multifunctional molecular components onto DNA frameworks, allowing for the in situ measurement of membrane tension and membrane curvatures in real time, which opens up new avenues for studying cellular membrane dynamics.







Abstract
Membrane curvature reflects physical forces operating on the lipid membrane, which plays important roles in cellular processes. Here, we design a mechanosensitive DNA (MSD) nanomachine that mimics natural mechanosensitive PIEZO channels to convert the membrane tension changes of lipid vesicles with different sizes into fluorescence signals in real time. The MSD nanomachine consists of an archetypical six&#8208;helix&#8208;bundle DNA nanopore, cholesterol&#8208;based membrane anchors, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, spiropyran (SP). We find that the DNA nanopore effectively amplifies subtle variations of the membrane tension, which effectively induces the isomerization of weakly emissive SP into highly emissive merocyanine isomers for visualizing membrane tension changes. By measuring the membrane tension via the fluorescence of MSD nanomachine, we establish the correlation between the membrane tension and the curvature that follows the Young&#8208;Laplace equation. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;enabled strategy opens new routes to studying membrane mechanics in physiological and pathological settings.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane curvature reflects physical forces operating on the lipid membrane, which plays important roles in cellular processes. Here, we design a mechanosensitive DNA (MSD) nanomachine that mimics natural mechanosensitive PIEZO channels to convert the membrane tension changes of lipid vesicles with different sizes into fluorescence signals in real time. The MSD nanomachine consists of an archetypical six-helix-bundle DNA nanopore, cholesterol-based membrane anchors, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, spiropyran (SP). We find that the DNA nanopore effectively amplifies subtle variations of the membrane tension, which effectively induces the isomerization of weakly emissive SP into highly emissive merocyanine isomers for visualizing membrane tension changes. By measuring the membrane tension via the fluorescence of MSD nanomachine, we establish the correlation between the membrane tension and the curvature that follows the Young-Laplace equation. This DNA nanotechnology-enabled strategy opens new routes to studying membrane mechanics in physiological and pathological settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thiophene Backbone Enables Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(arylene vinylene)s with High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline, planar and fully thiophene&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional poly(arylene vinylene) is developed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation. It exhibits a narrow optical band gap and efficient &#960;&#8208;delocalization for band&#8208;like transport and high charge carrier mobility.







Abstract
Linear conjugated polymers have attracted significant attention in organic electronics in recent decades. However, despite intrachain &#960;&#8208;delocalization, interchain hopping is their transport bottleneck. In contrast, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers, as represented by 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs), can provide multiple conjugated strands to enhance the delocalization of charge carriers in space. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of thiophene&#8208;based 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (PAVs, 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT and 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, BDT=benzodithiophene, BT=bithiophene, BP=biphenyl) via Knoevenagel polycondensation. Compared with 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, the fully thiophene&#8208;based 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT exhibits enhanced planarity and &#960;&#8208;delocalization with a small band gap (1.62&#8197;eV) and large electronic band dispersion, as revealed by the optical absorption and density functional calculations. Remarkably, temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz spectroscopy discloses a unique band&#8208;like transport and outstanding room&#8208;temperature charge mobility for 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT (65&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), which far exceeds that of the linear PAVs, 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, and the reported 2D c&#8208;COFs in the powder form. This work highlights the great potential of thiophene&#8208;based 2D PAVs as candidates for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronics.

         <title>Tetraazacoronenes and Their Dimers, Trimers and Tetramers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraazacoronenes were synthesized from bay&#8208;functionalized tetraazaperylenes by Zr&#8208;mediated cyclization and four&#8208;fold Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling. The latter not only gives the tetraazacoronene target compound but also the condensed azacoronene dimer and higher oligomers.







Abstract
Tetraazacoronenes were synthesized from bay&#8208;functionalized tetraazaperylenes by Zr&#8208;mediated cyclization and four&#8208;fold Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling. In the Zr&#8208;mediated approach, an &#951;4&#8208;cyclobutadiene&#8208;zirconium(IV) complex was isolated as an intermediate to cyclobutene&#8208;annulated derivatives. Using bis(pinacolatoboryl)vinyltrimethylsilane as a C2 building block gave the tetraazacoronene target compound along with the condensed azacoronene dimer as well as higher oligomers. The series of extended azacoronenes show highly resolved UV/Vis absorption bands with increased extinction coefficients for the extended aromatic cores and fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;% at 659&#8197;nm.

         <title>A Quadruple&#8208;Borylated Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitter with para/meta Heteroatomic Patterns for Narrowband Orange&#8208;Red Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid pattern strategy is proposed, and a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept multiple resonance emitter B4N6&#8208;Me containing four boron atoms and six nitrogen atoms, namely, B4N6&#8208;Me, is designed. B4N6&#8208;Me bracingly realizes narrowband orange&#8208;red emission with an extremely narrow full width at half maxima of 19&#8197;nm (energy unit: 70&#8197;meV) and delivers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 35.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hindered by spectral broadening issues with redshifted emission, long&#8208;wavelength (e.g., maxima beyond 570&#8197;nm) multiple resonance (MR) emitters with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) below 20&#8197;nm remain absent. Herein, by strategically embedding diverse boron (B)/nitrogen (N) atomic pairs into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) skeleton, we propose a hybrid pattern for the construction of a long&#8208;wavelength narrowband MR emitter. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter B4N6&#8208;Me realized orange&#8208;red emission with an extremely small FWHM of 19&#8197;nm (energy unit: 70&#8197;meV), representing the narrowest FWHM among all reported long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cooperation of the applied para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N and para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B/N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N patterns is complementary, which gives rise to both narrowband and redshift characteristics. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing B4N6&#8208;Me achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, e.g., a narrowband orange&#8208;red emission with an FWHM of 27&#8197;nm (energy unit: 99&#8197;meV), an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8&#8201;%, and ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE of 28.4&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2). This work provides new insights into the further molecular design and synthesis of long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters.

         <title>Observing the Entry Events of a Titanium&#8208;Based Photoredox Catalytic Cycle in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence and ultrafast mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopies are combined to watch the decisive primary events of entry into a sustainable photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle utilizing an affordable, non&#8208;toxic, and highly efficient titanium(IV) photocatalyst.







Abstract
Titanium&#8208;based catalysis in single electron transfer (SET) steps has evolved into a versatile approach for the synthesis of fine chemicals and first attempts have recently been made to enhance its sustainability by merging it with photo&#8208;redox (PR) catalysis. Here, we explore the photochemical principles of all&#8208;Ti&#8208;based SET&#8208;PR&#8208;catalysis, i.e. in the absence of a precious metal PR&#8208;co&#8208;catalyst. By combining time&#8208;resolved emission with ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe (UV/MIR) spectroscopy on femtosecond&#8208;to&#8208;microsecond time scales we quantify the dynamics of the critical events of entry into the catalytic cycle; namely, the singlet&#8208;triplet interconversion of the do&#8208;it&#8208;all titanocene(IV) PR&#8208;catalyst and its one&#8208;electron reduction by a sacrificial amine electron donor. The results highlight the importance of the PR&#8208;catalyst's singlet&#8208;triplet gap as a design guide for future improvements.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual magneto&#8208;optical thermometer is demonstrated using a high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnet. A multiparametric approach based on the independent magneto&#8208;optical readouts makes possible a 10&#8208;fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometer, allowing the limitations inherent to Boltzmann thermometers to be overcome.







Abstract
Luminescent thermometry allows the remote detection of the temperature and holds great potential in future technological applications in which conventional systems could not operate. Complementary approaches to measuring the temperature aiming to enhance the thermal sensitivity would however represent a decisive step forward. For the first time, we demonstrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that luminescence thermometry could be associated with a complementary temperature readout related to a different property. Namely, we propose to take advantage of the temperature dependence of both magnetic (canonical susceptibility and relaxation time) and luminescence features (emission intensity) found in Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets (SMM) to develop original dual magneto&#8208;optical molecular thermometers to conciliate high&#8208;performance SMM and Boltzmann&#8208;type luminescence thermometry. We highlight this integrative approach to concurrent luminescent and magnetic thermometry using an air&#8208;stable benchmark SMM [Dy(bbpen)Cl] (H2bbpen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethyl&#8208;enediamine)) exhibiting Dy3+ luminescence. The synergy between multiparametric magneto&#8208;optical readouts and multiple linear regression makes possible a 10&#8208;fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometer over the whole temperature range, compared with the values obtained with the single optical or magnetic devices.

         <title>Extension of Non&#8208;alternant Nanographenes Containing Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saddle&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales topological defects have been synthesized that possess much narrower energy gaps than similar&#8208;sized N&#8208;doped nanographenes with six&#8208;membered rings. This work indicates that the introduction of non&#8208;alternant topologies is an efficient way to narrow the energy gap without extending the molecular size.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant topologies have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics in recent years. Here, three novel topological nanographenes molecular models of nitrogen&#8208;doped Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales (S&#8211;T&#8211;W) defects were achieved through intramolecular direct arylation. Their chemical structures were unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal analysis. Among them, threefold intramolecular direct arylation compound (C42H21N) is the largest nanographene bearing a N&#8208;doped non&#8208;alternant topology to date, in which the non&#8208;benzenoid rings account for 83&#8201;% of the total molecular skeleton. The absorption maxima of this compound was located in the near&#8208;infrared region with a long tail up to 900&#8197;nm, which was much longer than those reported for similarly sized N&#8208;doped nanographene with six&#8208;membered rings (C40H15N). In addition, the electronic energy gaps of these series compounds clearly decreased with the introduction of non&#8208;alternant topologies (from 2.27&#8197;eV to 1.50&#8197;eV). It is noteworthy that C42H21N possesses such a low energy gap (Egopt=1.40&#8197;eV; Egcv=1.50&#8197;eV), yet is highly stable under ambient conditions. Our work reported herein demonstrates that the non&#8208;alternant topology could significantly influence the electronic configurations of nanocarbons, where the introduction of a non&#8208;alternanting topology may be an effective way to narrow the energy gap without extending the molecular &#960;&#8208;conjugation.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Activation of Hydroxyl Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxyl polymer PTFHQ has been designed to obtain electrochemical activity through an in situ electrochemical activation process. The synergistic effects of the different functional groups (C=O, &#8722;OH, and &#8722;S&#8722;) and the unique Z&#8208;folded structure of the activated PTFHQ effectively improve its electrochemical activity and contribute to the rapid reaction kinetics, realizing the construction of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;organic batteries.







Abstract
The slow reaction kinetics and structural instability of organic electrode materials limit the further performance improvement of aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we have synthesized a Z&#8208;folded hydroxyl polymer polytetrafluorohydroquinone (PTFHQ) with inert hydroxyl groups that could be partially oxidized to the active carbonyl groups through the in situ activation process and then undertake the storage/release of Zn2+. In the activated PTFHQ, the hydroxyl groups and S atoms enlarge the electronegativity region near the electrochemically active carbonyl groups, enhancing their electrochemical activity. Simultaneously, the residual hydroxyl groups could act as hydrophilic groups to enhance the electrolyte wettability while ensuring the stability of the polymer chain in the electrolyte. Also, the Z&#8208;folded structure of PTFHQ plays an important role in reversible binding with Zn2+ and fast ion diffusion. All these benefits make the activated PTFHQ exhibit a high specific capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 3400 stable cycles with a capacity retention of 92&#8201;%, and an outstanding rate capability of 196&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering of Therapeutic and Detoxifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Therapeutic enzymes have immense potential for treating human diseases, but their clinical application is hindered by the need for substantial improvement through protein engineering. Advanced techniques like design and directed evolution can enhance therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new therapeutic activities and high selectivity.







Abstract
Therapeutic enzymes present excellent opportunities for the treatment of human disease, modulation of metabolic pathways and system detoxification. However, current use of enzyme therapy in the clinic is limited as naturally occurring enzymes are seldom optimal for such applications and require substantial improvement by protein engineering. Engineering strategies such as design and directed evolution that have been successfully implemented for industrial biocatalysis can significantly advance the field of therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new&#8208;to&#8208;nature therapeutic activities, high selectivity, and suitability for medical applications. This minireview highlights case studies of how state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging methods in protein engineering are explored for the generation of therapeutic enzymes and discusses gaps and future opportunities in the field of enzyme therapy.

         <title>A Paramagnetic Compass Based on Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic lanthanide metal&#8211;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF) crystals show unexpected compass&#8208;like alignments at low fields (&#8764;mT). The magnetic alignments originate from the symmetry&#8208;related summation of Ln&#8208;ions&#8217; molecular anisotropy, among which the perpendicular, parallel, and inclined alignments can be manipulated and switched by crystal structures and chemical environments.







Abstract
Macroscopic compass&#8208;like magnetic alignment at low magnetic fields is natural for ferromagnetic materials but is seldomly observed in paramagnetic materials. Herein, we report a &#8220;paramagnetic compass&#8221; that magnetically aligns under &#8764;mT fields based on the single&#8208;crystalline framework constructed by lanthanide ions and organic ligands (Ln&#8208;MOF). The magnetic alignment is attributed to the Ln&#8208;MOF's strong macroscopic anisotropy, where the highly&#8208;ordered structure allows the Ln&#8208;ions&#8217; molecular anisotropy to be summed according to the crystal symmetry. In tetragonal Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignment is either parallel or perpendicular to the field depending on the easiest axis of the molecular anisotropy. Reversible switching between the two alignments is realized upon the removal and re&#8208;adsorption of solvent molecules filled in the framework. When the crystal symmetry is lowered in monoclinic Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignments become even inclined (47&#176;&#8208;66&#176;) to the field. These fascinating properties of Ln&#8208;MOFs would encourage further explorations of framework materials containing paramagnetic centers.

         <title>Improved Thermal and Chemical Stability of Oxynitride Phosphor from Facile Chemical Synthesis for Vehicle Cornering Lights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxynitride SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ derived from the nitride SrAlSi4N7:Eu2+ not only enables the facile synthesis by air&#8208;stable raw materials SrCO3, AlN and Si3N4 but also achieves zero&#8208;thermal quenching, due to oxygen vacancies. Additionally, the SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ phosphor shows high chemical stabilities against heat and water immersion.







Abstract
Orange Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors are essential for light&#8208;emitting diodes for cornering lights to prevent fatal road accidents at night, but such phosphors require features of high thermal, chemical stability and facile synthesis. This study reports a series of yellow&#8208;orange&#8208;red emitting SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ oxynitride phosphors, derived from the SrAlSi4N7 nitride iso&#8208;structure by replacing Si4+&#8722;N3&#8722; with Al3+&#8722;O2&#8722;. The introduction of a certain amount of oxygen enabled the facile synthesis under atmospheric pressure using the air&#8208;stable raw materials SrCO3, Eu2O3, AlN and Si3N4. SrAl2Si3ON6 has a smaller band gap and lower structure rigidity than SrAlSi4N7 (5.19&#8197;eV vs 5.50&#8197;eV, Debye temperature 719&#8197;K vs 760&#8197;K), but exhibits higher thermal stability with 100&#8201;% of room temperature intensity remaining at 150&#8201;&#176;C compared to 85&#8201;% for SrAlSi4N7. Electron paramagnetic resonance, thermoluminescence and density functional theory revealed that the oxygen vacancy electron traps compensated the thermal loss. Additionally, no decrease in emission intensity was found after either being heated at 500&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;hours or being immersed in water for 20&#8197;days, implying both of the thermal and chemical stability of SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ phosphors. The strategy of oxynitride&#8208;introduction from nitride promotes the development of low&#8208;cost thermally and chemically stable luminescent materials.

         <title>Regulation of d&#8208;Band Centers in Localized CdS Homojunctions through Facet Control for Improved Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The d&#8208;band center of localized CdS homojunctions has been regulated by high and low index facet control for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates in water overall splitting reaction. Photoexcited electrons and holes are separately transferred to reductive (002) and oxidative (110) facets within localized field to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen (H2) and oxygen evolution at a solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 efficiency of 2.20&#8201;%.







Abstract
The accelerated kinetic behaviour of charge carrier transfer and its unhindered surface reaction dynamic process involving oxygenated&#8208;intermediate activation and conversion are urgently required in photocatalytic water (H2O) overall splitting, which has not been nevertheless resolved yet. Herein, localized CdS homojunctions with optimal collocation of high and low index facets to regulate d&#8208;band center for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates (*&#8208;OH and *&#8208;O) have been achieved in H2O overall splitting into hydrogen. Density functional theory, hall effect, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy confirm that, electrons and holes are kinetically transferred to reductive high index facet (002) and oxidative low index facet (110) of the localized CdS homojunction induced by facet Fermi level difference to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, along with a solar conversion into hydrogen (STH) of 2.20&#8201;% by Air Mass 1.5 Global filter irradiation. These findings contribute to solving the kinetic bottleneck issues of photocatalytic H2O splitting, which will further enhance STH.

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Cyclic Mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic 32&#8208;mer polymannoside, which represents the largest cyclic polysaccharide synthesized so far, was successfully constructed by a promoter&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach under high&#8208;dilution conditions. Analysis of the cyclic 2&#8208;mer, 4&#8208;mer, 8&#8208;mer, 16&#8208;mer, and 32&#8208;mer mannosides by advanced NMR spectroscopy and computational studies indicated that the cyclic mannosides of various sizes adopted different conformational states and shapes.







Abstract
Cyclodextrins are widely used as carriers of small molecules for drug delivery owing to their remarkable host properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, cyclic oligosaccharides with different sizes and shapes are limited. Cycloglycosylation of ultra&#8208;large bifunctional saccharide precursors is challenging due to the constrained conformational spaces. Herein we report a promoter&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach for the synthesis of cyclic &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer. Cycloglycosylation of the bifunctional thioglycosides and (Z)&#8208;ynenoates was found to be highly dependent on the promoters. In particular, a sufficient amount of a gold(I) complex played a key role in the proper preorganization of the ultra&#8208;large cyclic transition state, providing a cyclic 32&#8208;mer polymannoside, which represents the largest synthetic cyclic polysaccharide to date. NMR experiments and a computational study revealed that the cyclic 2&#8208;mer, 4&#8208;mer, 8&#8208;mer, 16&#8208;mer, and 32&#8208;mer mannosides adopted different conformational states and shapes.

         <title>Reversing the Enantioselectivity of Enzymatic Carbene N&#8722;H Insertion Through Mechanism&#8208;Guided Protein Engineering
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational modelling was employed to rationally guide protein engineering toward controlling the accessible conformations of a key lactone&#8208;carbene (LAC) intermediate in the enzyme active site by installing a new H&#8208;bond anchoring point. This H&#8208;bonding interaction controls the relative orientation of the fleeting carbene intermediate, orienting it for an enantioselective N&#8208;nucleophilic attack by the amine substrate.







Abstract
We report a computationally driven approach to access enantiodivergent enzymatic carbene N&#8722;H insertions catalyzed by P411 enzymes. Computational modeling was employed to rationally guide engineering efforts to control the accessible conformations of a key lactone&#8208;carbene (LAC) intermediate in the enzyme active site by installing a new H&#8208;bond anchoring point. This H&#8208;bonding interaction controls the relative orientation of the reactive carbene intermediate, orienting it for an enantioselective N&#8208;nucleophilic attack by the amine substrate. By combining MD simulations and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screening targeted to only two key residues, we were able to reverse the stereoselectivity of previously engineered S&#8208;selective P411 enzymes. The resulting variant, L5_FL&#8208;B3, accepts a broad scope of amine substrates for N&#8722;H insertion with excellent yields (up to &gt;99&#8201;%), high efficiency (up to 12&#8201;300 TTN), and good enantiocontrol (up to 7&#8201;:&#8201;93 er).

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Dendritic Hyperbranched Polyacrylates and Their Topological Block Polymers by Organotellurium&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization in Water

         <dc:description>
Copolymerization of a vinyl telluride and butyl acrylate (BA) using organotellurium&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (TERP) under emulsion conditions afforded structurally controlled hyperbranched poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) as polymer particles dispersed in water. Various block copolymers consisting of different topologies were successfully synthesized using macro&#8208;TERP CTA with linear and HB structures.







Abstract
The practical synthesis of structurally controlled hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) by organotellurium&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (TERP) in water under emulsion conditions is reported. Copolymerization of vinyltelluride named evolmer, which induces controlled branch structure, and acrylates with TERP chain transfer agent (CTA) in water afforded HBPs having dendron structure. The molecular weight, dispersity, branch number, and branch length of the HBPs were controlled by changing the amount of CTA, evolmer, and acrylate monomers. HB&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) with up to the 8th generation having an average of 255 branches were successfully synthesized. As the monomer conversion reached nearly quantitative and the obtained polymer particles were well dispersed in water, the method is highly suitable for synthesizing topological block polymers, block polymers consisting of different topologies. Thus, linear&#8208;block&#8208;HB, HB&#8208;block&#8208;linear, and HB&#8208;block&#8208;HB&#8208;PBAs with the controlled structure were successfully synthesized by adding the second monomer(s) to the macro&#8208;CTA. The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting homo&#8208; and topological block PBAs was systematically controlled by the degree of the branch, the branch length, and the topology. Therefore, the method opens the possibility of obtaining various HBPs with diverse branch structures and tuning the polymer properties by the polymer topology.

         <title>Cooperative Ni(Co)&#8208;Ru&#8208;P Sites Activate Dehydrogenation for Hydrazine Oxidation Assisting Self&#8208;powered H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique atomic Ni(Co)&#8722;Ru&#8722;P interfacial sites on a matrix of NiCoP nanowire arrays were designed as highly active and stable catalysts for alkaline hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A self&#8208;powered H2 production system utilizing an overall hydrazine splitting device driven by a direct hydrazine fuel cell achieved a promising rate of 24.0&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Water electrolysis for H2 production is restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using the thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has attracted ever&#8208;growing attention. Herein, we report a twisted NiCoP nanowire array immobilized with Ru single atoms (Ru1&#8722;NiCoP) as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing an ultralow working potential of &#8722;60&#8197;mV and overpotential of 32&#8197;mV for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Inspiringly, two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer based on overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) demonstrates outstanding activity with a record&#8208;high current density of 522&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at cell voltage of 0.3&#8197;V. DFT calculations elucidate the cooperative Ni(Co)&#8722;Ru&#8722;P sites in Ru1&#8722;NiCoP optimize H* adsorption, and enhance adsorption of *N2H2 to significantly lower the energy barrier for hydrazine dehydrogenation. Moreover, a self&#8208;powered H2 production system utilizing OHzS device driven by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) achieve a satisfactory rate of 24.0&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Non&#8208;radiative Recombination Energy Losses in Organic Solar Cells Based on Asymmetric Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric acceptors, BTP&#8208;Cl and BTP&#8208;2Cl, were developed to study the relationship between the energy loss mechanism and molecular structure. The results demonstrate that the decreased surface electrostatic potential difference between asymmetric acceptor and donor reduces the charge transfer state ratio, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss.







Abstract
Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) is one key to boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells. Although the recent studies have indicated that the Y&#8208;series asymmetric acceptors&#8208;based devices featured relatively low &#916;E3, the understanding of the energy loss mechanism derived from molecular structure change is still lagging behind. Herein, two asymmetric acceptors named BTP&#8208;Cl and BTP&#8208;2Cl with different terminals were synthesized to make a clear comparative study with the symmetric acceptor BTP&#8208;0Cl. Our results suggest that asymmetric acceptors exhibit a larger difference of electrostatic potential (ESP) in terminals and semi&#8208;molecular dipole moment, which contributes to form a stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. Besides, the experimental and theoretical studies reveal that a lower ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular interaction can reduce the distribution of PM6 near the interface to enhance the built&#8208;in potential and decrease the charge transfer state ratio for asymmetric acceptors. Therefore, the devices achieve a higher exciton dissociation efficiency and lower &#916;E3. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and provides a new perspective to understand the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric acceptors.

         <title>Decoding Protein Dynamics in Cells Using Chemical Cross&#8208;Linking and Hierarchical Analysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study presents a hierarchical strategy using in vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry to decode dynamic protein conformations within cells. By integrating prior structural information and utilizing diverse structure calculation algorithms, we accurately characterize dynamic conformations of multi&#8208;domain proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive protein functions within cellular environments.







Abstract
Protein dynamics play a crucial role in their diverse functions. The intracellular environment significantly influences protein dynamics, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To comprehensively capture structural information from various proteins within cells and characterize protein dynamics, chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry was employed. In this study, we introduce a hierarchical decoding strategy that enables the investigation of protein dynamics in vivo. Computational analysis based on distance restraints derived from cross&#8208;links is used to infer protein dynamics in cells. To facilitate this analysis, we leverage the prior structure obtained from AlphaFold2. By employing this strategy, we can characterize the full&#8208;length structure of multi&#8208;domain proteins taking into account their distinct dynamic features. Furthermore, by combining restraint sampling with an unbiased sampling and evaluation approach, we can provide a comprehensive description of the intrinsic motion of IDPs. Consequently, the hierarchical strategy we propose holds significant potential in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that undelie protein functions in cells.

         <title>Base&#8208;Modulated 1,3&#8208;Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Carboboration of Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing two remote functional groups into rings via chain&#8208;walking represents a new strategy to efficiently access multi&#8208;substituted saturated cyclic compounds. We report an unprecedented 1,3&#8208;cis&#8208;carboboration of cyclohexenes by nickel catalysis. The application of LiOMe as base plays a crucial role in the success of this reaction.







Abstract
While chain&#8208;walking stimulates wide interest in both polymerization and organic synthesis, site&#8208; and stereoselective control of chain&#8208;walking on rings is still a challenging task in the realm of organometallic catalysis. Inspired by a controllable chain&#8208;walking on cyclohexane rings in olefin polymerization, we have developed a set of chain&#8208;walking carboborations of cyclohexenes based on nickel catalysis. Different from the 1,4&#8208;trans&#8208;selectivity disclosed in polymer science, a high level of 1,3&#8208;regio&#8208; and cis&#8208;stereoselectivity is obtained in our reactions. Mechanistically, we discovery that the base affects the reduction ability of B2pin2 and different bases lead to different catalytic cycles and different regioselective products (1,2&#8208; Vs 1,3&#8208;addition). This study provides a concise and modular method for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexylboron compounds. The incorporation of a readily modifiable boronate group greatly enhances the value of this method, the synthetic potential of which was highlighted by the synthesis of a series of high&#8208;valued commercial chemicals and pharmaceutically interesting molecules.

&lt;p&gt;While chain-walking stimulates wide interest in both polymerization and organic synthesis, site- and stereoselective control of chain-walking on rings is still a challenging task in the realm of organometallic catalysis. Inspired by a controllable chain-walking on cyclohexane rings in olefin polymerization, we have developed a set of chain-walking carboborations of cyclohexenes based on nickel catalysis. Different from the 1,4-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity disclosed in polymer science, a high level of 1,3-regio- and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-stereoselectivity is obtained in our reactions. Mechanistically, we discovery that the base affects the reduction ability of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and different bases lead to different catalytic cycles and different regioselective products (1,2- Vs 1,3-addition). This study provides a concise and modular method for the synthesis of 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexylboron compounds. The incorporation of a readily modifiable boronate group greatly enhances the value of this method, the synthetic potential of which was highlighted by the synthesis of a series of high-valued commercial chemicals and pharmaceutically interesting molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bonding and Acidity of the Formal Hydride in the Prototypical Au9(PPh3)8H2+ Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;bound hydrogen has been shown to improve chemical reactivity and selectivity in gold clusters. However, the chemical properties and reactivity of these hydrogen atoms is difficult to directly probe. We show for the prototypical cluster Au9(PPh3)8H2+ that the hydrogen bonds to the cluster in a manner somewhere between a covalent bond and a particle in a box, and that it is likely to behave as a moderate acid.







Abstract
The role of hydrogen atoms as surface ligands on metal nanoclusters is of profound importance but remains difficult to directly study. While hydrogen atoms often appear to be incorporated formally as hydrides, evidence suggests that they donate electrons to the cluster's delocalized superatomic orbitals and may consequently behave as acidic protons that play key roles in synthetic or catalytic mechanisms. Here we directly test this assertion for the prototypical Au9(PPh3)8H2+ nanocluster, formed by addition of a hydride to the well&#8208;characterized Au9(PPh3)83+. Using gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy, we were able to unambiguously isolate Au9(PPh3)8H2+ and Au9(PPh3)8D2+, revealing an Au&#8722;H stretching mode at 1528&#8197;cm&#8722;1 that shifts to 1038&#8197;cm&#8722;1 upon deuteration. This shift is greater than the maximum expected for a typical harmonic potential, suggesting a potential governing cluster&#8208;H bonding that has some square&#8208;well character consistent with the hydrogen nucleus behaving as a metal atom in the cluster core. Complexing this cluster with very weak bases reveals a redshift of 37&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the Au&#8722;H vibration, consistent with those typically seen for moderately acidic groups in gas phase molecules and providing an estimate of the acidity of Au9(PPh3)8H2+, at least with regard to its surface reactivity.
