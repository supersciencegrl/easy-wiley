         <title>Schiff Base Mediated Dipeptide Assembly toward Nanoarchitectonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is fascinating because of its dual nature. It perfectly combines the reversible nature of noncovalent bonds with the robustness of covalent bonds, effectively enhancing the stability of assemblies and meanwhile giving rise to unprecedent properties. Therefore, integration of DCC with supramolecular chemistry has emerged as a versatile and an extraordinarily useful approach in directing peptide assembly. This minireview focuses on recent strategy, which exploits dynamic Schiff base chemistry in combination with supramolecular chemistry to mediate dipeptide assembly toward nanoarchitectonics. Diversified structures, new emergent properties and their related applications are highlighted. Lastly, the opportunities and prospects in this exciting field have also been introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a M&#246;bius Helicene Carbon Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the first helicene carbon nanoohop that integrates a [6]helicene into [7]cycloparaphenylene. The [6]helicene endows the helicene carbon nanohoop with chiroptical properties and configurational stability typical for higher helicenes, while the radially conjugated seven  para  &#8208;phenylenes largely determine the optoelectronic properties. The structure of the helicene carbon nanoohop was unambiguously characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray analysis that revealed that it possesses a topology of a M&#246;bius strip in the solid state and in solution. The chirality transfers from the [6]helicene to the  para  &#8208;phenylenes and leads to a pronounced circular dichroism and bright circularly polarized luminescence, which is affected by the structural topology of the nanohoop.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Solar Evaporation Using a Scalable MoS2&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Highly Efficient Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) was successfully constructed with a hydrophilic polyacrylamide as its skeleton and commercial MoS2 as the solar absorbent through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. The SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination.







Abstract
Interfacial photo&#8208;vapor conversion has been suggested as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable technology for seawater desalination. However, the conversion performance was still limited by some drawbacks, like salt accumulation and poor mechanical stability. Herein, a scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) with good mechanical stability and salt resistance was successfully constructed through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. With the high porosity (92.63&#8201;%), the SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination. Most importantly, the SMoS2&#8208;PH could maintain high and stable photothermal properties for 15&#8197;days on the surface of seawater. We believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial MoS2 make the SMoS2&#8208;PH a promising device for full&#8208;scale seawater desalination.

         <title>Multicomponent Crystals with Competing Intermolecular Interactions: In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction and Luminescent Features Reveal Multimolecular Assembly under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of multicomponent molecules with three or more components, which is considered difficult, can be solved by using pre&#8208;stored intermolecular interactions. The fast progression of mechanochemical synthesis has been revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, whereby the self&#8208;assembly behavior could be expressed as a function of solid&#8208;state luminescence driven by the combination of components.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry under mechanochemical conditions has drawn attention because it can induce low&#8208;solubility molecules to self&#8208;assemble, although most of the reported examples have been limited to two&#8208;component systems. We applied mechanochemical synthesis to achieve multimolecular self&#8208;assembly in more challenging three&#8208;component systems. The produced crystals showed multicolor solid&#8208;state luminescence depending on the components when exposed to UV light. Optical outputs and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were used to examine the self&#8208;assembling behavior in greater depth. Using synchrotron radiation, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction permitted direct observation of the milling process, which started the self&#8208;assembly process within 1&#8197;min. This research emphasizes the importance of multicomponent molecules with optical functions and self&#8208;assembling behavior and offers the possibility of developing more complicated multicomponent crystals and organic solid solutions for advanced materials.

         <title>Alcohols as Alkylating Agents: Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Alkylation via In Situ Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcohols are among the most commercially accessible alkyl fragments, yet their direct use in C(sp3)&#8208;based fragment couplings remains underdeveloped. In this report, a mild strategy for the in situ activation of alcohols by benzoxazolium salts is applied to deoxygenative conjugate alkylation for a broad range of alcohol and Michael acceptor substrates, including structurally diverse drugs, natural products, and biomolecules.







Abstract
The rapid exploration of sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is facilitated by fragment&#8208;coupling technologies that utilize simple and abundant alkyl precursors, among which alcohols are a highly desirable, commercially accessible, and synthetically versatile class of substrate. Herein, we describe an operationally convenient, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;mediated deoxygenative Giese&#8208;type addition of alcohol&#8208;derived alkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes under mild photocatalytic conditions. The fragment coupling accommodates a broad range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol partners, as well as structurally varied Michael acceptors containing traditionally reactive sites, such as electrophilic or oxidizable moieties. We demonstrate the late&#8208;stage diversification of densely functionalized molecular architectures, including drugs and biomolecules, and we further telescope our protocol with metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;coupling for step&#8208;economic access to sp3&#8208;rich complexity.

         <title>Anionic Co&#8208;insertion Charge Storage in Dinitrobenzene Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic co&#8208;insertion charge storage in dinitrobenzene cathodes is reported, which entails two successive coordination/decoordinations of Zn(OTF)+ complex with the nitro oxygen. The nitroaromatic multielectron chemistry contributes to ultrahigh capacity, fast redox kinetics, and superior cycle stability for the assembled aqueous Zn&#8211;organic battery.







Abstract
Highly active and stable cathodes are critical for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries with high capacity, fast redox kinetics, and long life. We herein report para&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and ortho&#8208;dinitrobenzene (p&#8208;, m&#8208;, and o&#8208;DB) containing two successive two&#8208;electron processes, as cathode materials to boost the battery performance. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that nitro constitutional isomerism is key to zincophilic activity and redox kinetics. p&#8208;DB hosted in carbon nanoflower harvests a high capacity of 402&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a superior stability up to 25&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, giving a Zn&#8211;organic battery with a high energy density of 230&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. An anionic co&#8208;insertion charge storage mechanism is proposed, entailing a two&#8208;step (de)coordination of Zn(CF3SO3)+ with nitro oxygen. Besides, dinitrobenzene can be electrochemically optimized by side group regulation via implanting electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs. This work opens a new window to design multielectron nitroaromatics for Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Low&#8208;Valent Metal Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of low&#8208;valent MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers formed by bonding interactions between metals and multitopic organic ligands. These are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of low&#8208;valent MOFs and offers a perspective on the future development of these materials.

         <title>Tuning Interphase Chemistry to Stabilize High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode Material via Spinel Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compositions of cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) are largely controlled by the abundant species in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and could be tuned from material aspects. Passivating the reactive cathode surface enables anion&#8208;rich IHLs and LiF&#8208;rich CEIs, not only demonstrating high thermal/cycling stability but also shedding new light on the formation, properties, and modulation of CEIs for advanced battery materials.







Abstract
Cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) are critical to the cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage cathodes for batteries, yet their formation mechanism and properties remain elusive. Here we report that the compositions of CEIs are largely controlled by abundant species in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and can be tuned from material aspects. The IHL of LiCoO2 (LCO) was found to alter after charging, with a solvent&#8208;rich environment that results in fragile organic&#8208;rich CEIs. By passivated spinel Li4Mn5O12 coating, we achieve an anion&#8208;rich IHL after charging, thus enabling robust LiF&#8208;rich CEIs. In situ microscopy reveals that LiF&#8208;rich CEIs maintain mechanical integrity at 500&#8201;&#176;C, in sharp contrast to organic&#8208;rich CEIs which undergo severe expansion and subsequent voids/cracks in the cathode. As a result, the spinel&#8208;coated LCO exhibits a high specific capacity of 194&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;C and a capacity retention of 83&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. Our work sheds new light on modulating CEIs for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Template&#8208;Guided Regioselective Encaging of Platinum Single Atoms into Y Zeolite: Enhanced Selectivity in Semihydrogenation and Resistance to Poisoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single platinum atoms were selectively encaged into six&#8208;membered rings of sodalite cages within Y zeolite with the aid of a template&#8208;guiding method. The catalyst exhibited good selectivity and stability, and excellent resistance to poisoning in semihydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
It is challenging to establish single metal atoms with a uniform coordination environment at targeted sites of a zeolite. In this study, single platinum atoms were selectively encaged in the six&#8208;membered rings of sodalite (SOD) cages within Y zeolite using a template&#8208;guiding strategy. During the in&#8197;situ synthesis process, template molecules were designed to occupy supercages and thereby force coordinated platinum species into SOD cages. Subsequent control of the post&#8208;treatment conditions yielded the Y zeolite with selectively encaged single platinum atoms, denoted Pt@Y&#8208;SOD. The Pt@Y&#8208;SOD catalyst had good stability and excellent catalytic selectivity in the semihydrogenation reaction, and it exhibited interesting thiophene and carbon monoxide resistance in this transformation because interactions with these poisons are weakened by the configuration of the encaged single platinum atoms.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Photocatalysis Using Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: Sensitizing Molecular Isomerization and Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet energy transfer from perovskite nanocrystals can drive a host of organic isomerization and cycloaddition reactions, under much milder conditions than photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
A relatively new addition to the application portfolio of lead halide perovskites is to photosensitize molecular triplets for a variety of photochemical applications. Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven isomerization and cycloaddition of organic molecules sensitized by spectrally&#8208;tunable perovskite nanocrystals. We first demonstrate with stilbene as the substrate molecule that photoisomerization can proceed efficiently and rapidly by either directly grafting carboxylated stilbene onto nanocrystal surfaces or using triplet&#8211;acceptor ligands as the energy relay. The relay approach is more generally applicable as it does not require anchoring&#8208;group functionalization of substrate molecules, allowing us to facilely extend it to isomerization of a series of substituted stilbene molecules and ring&#8208;closing isomerization of diarylethene, as well as intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of acenaphthylene. This study opens an avenue of energy&#8208;transfer photocatalysis using perovskite nanocrystals.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Interpretable Descriptors for the Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship of Surface Lattice Oxygen on Doped Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data&#8208;driven interpretable descriptors were constructed to predict the redox activity of surface lattice oxygen on doped vanadium oxides by combining density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Based on descriptors, physical insights into the structure&#8211;activity relationships were obtained and further guided the experimental verification of efficient redox catalysts for chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL&#8208;ODH) of propane.







Abstract
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship of surface lattice oxygen is critical but challenging to design efficient redox catalysts. This paper describes data&#8208;driven redox activity descriptors on doped vanadium oxides combining density functional theory and interpretable machine learning. We corroborate that the p&#8208;band center is the most crucial feature for the activity. Besides, some features from the coordination environment, including unoccupied d&#8208;band center, s&#8208; and d&#8208;band fillings, also play important roles in tuning the oxygen activity. Further analysis reveals that data&#8208;driven descriptors could decode more information about electron transfer during the redox process. Based on the descriptors, we report that atomic Re&#8208; and W&#8208;doping could inhibit over&#8208;oxidation in the chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which is verified by subsequent experiments and calculations. This work sheds light on the structure&#8211;activity relationship of lattice oxygen for the rational design of redox catalysts.

         <title>Direct Enantioselective Addition of Alkynes to Imines by a Highly Efficient Palladacycle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrocenyl palladacycle complex has been identified as a highly enantioselective catalyst for 1,2&#8208;additions of a diverse range of alkynes to imines (39 examples) providing nearly enantiopure propargylic amine derivatives. Compared to known methods turnover numbers could be increased by ca. 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude.







Abstract
Enantiopure propargylic amines are highly valuable synthetic building blocks. Much effort has been devoted to develop methods for their preparation. The arguably most important strategy is the 1,2&#8208;addition of alkynes to imines. Despite remarkable progress, the known methods using Zn and Cu catalysts suffer from the need for high catalyst loadings, typically ranging from 2&#8211;60&#8197;mol&#8201;% for neutral aldimine substrates. Here we report a planar chiral Pd complex acting as very efficient catalyst for direct asymmetric alkyne additions to imines, requiring very low catalyst loadings. Turnover numbers of up to 8700 were accomplished. Our investigation suggests that a Pd&#8208;acetylide complex is generated as a catalytically relevant intermediate by the aid of an acac ligand acting as internal catalytic base. It is shown that the catalyst is quite stable under the reaction conditions and that product inhibition is not an issue. A total of 39 examples is shown which all yielded almost enantiopure products.

         <title>Surface Activation and Ni&#8208;S Stabilization in NiO/NiS2 for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk doped Fe not only accelerates the surface reconstruction of NiO/NiS2 into the active NiOOH phase at a lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential but also alleviates the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni&#8722;S bonds to provide a promising way to balance the activity and stability of sulfur&#8208;containing materials in the OER process.







Abstract
Manipulating the active species and improving the structural stabilization of sulfur&#8208;containing catalysts during the OER process remain a tremendous challenge. Herein, we constructed NiO/NiS2 and Fe&#8722;NiO/NiS2 as catalyst models to study the effect of Fe doping. As expected, Fe&#8722;NiO/NiS2 exhibits a low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The accumulation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials after Fe doping can promote the formation of highly active NiOOH at a lower OER potential. Moreover, we investigated the level of corrosion of M&#8722;S bonds and compared the stability variation of M&#8722;S bonds with Fe at different locations. Interestingly, Fe bonded with S in the bulk as the sacrificial agent can alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni&#8722;S bonds and thus endow Fe&#8722;NiO/NiS2 long&#8208;term durability. This work could motivate the community to focus more on resolving the corrosion of sulfur&#8208;containing materials.

         <title>A Copper Cage&#8208;Complex as Mimic of the pMMO CuC Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of copper complexes that replicate the CuC site of particulate methane monooxygenase is presented. Although this site is of great interest in the debate about the nature of the active site, it has not yet been modeled in a biomimetic study. The detailed replication leads to striking EPR similarities of the copper(II) state to purified pMMO. Further aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as bioinspired substrates is shown.







Abstract
The active site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and its mechanism of action are not known. Recently, the CuC site emerged as a potential active site, but to date it lacks any study on biomimetic resemblance of the coordination environment provided by the enzyme. Here, the synthesis of a cage ligand providing such an environment is reported. Copper is incorporated, and coordination occurs by the two imidazole and one carboxylate group offered by the ligand. Depending on the oxidation state, it can adopt different coordination modes, as evidenced by the solid&#8208;state structures and computational investigation. The copper(I) state readily reacts with dioxygen and thereby undergoes CH activation. Moreover, the catalytic aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as ubiquinol mimics is shown. Clean one&#8208;electron oxidation occurs under mild conditions and EPR analysis of the copper(II) state in the presence of water reveals striking similarities to the data obtained from pMMO.

         <title>Giant Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption by Heptazine Organometalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic donors covalently attached to an s&#8208;heptazine acceptor afford photo&#8208;stable materials that possess outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections in the technologically important near&#8208;infrared III region of the spectrum, and exceptional four&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections in the recently proposed 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm window.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) is of increasing interest for applications in technologically important &#8220;windows&#8221; of the electromagnetic spectrum (near&#8208;infrared III, NIR&#8208;III, 1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm; and the new 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm region); however, few molecules exist that display strong MPA at these long wavelengths. We herein report the syntheses of the first 2,5,8&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine&#8208;cored organometallic complexes, together with organic analogues. The complexes exhibit outstanding 3PA cross&#8208;sections in the NIR&#8208;III and exceptional 4PA cross&#8208;sections in the new 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm window. We demonstrate that replacing organic donor groups by organometallic units results in an order of magnitude increase in 3PA, the &#8220;switching on&#8221; of 4PA, and a dramatic improvement in photo&#8208;stability. Our results highlight the impressive outcomes possible with an &#8220;organometalation&#8221; approach to NLO materials design.

         <title>Light&#8208; and Field&#8208;Controlled Diffusion, Ejection, Flow and Collection of Liquid at a Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensionally steered liquid transport at nanoporous liquid crystal polymer coatings is realized by sequential UV exposure and electric field application. UV induces through&#8208;thickness unidirectional liquid secretion. The subsequently applied electric field reallocates the ejected liquid to predesigned locations. Interestingly, UV&#8208;gated liquid transport is revealed, which dramatically decreases both threshold voltage and threshold frequency.







Abstract
Liquid manipulation at solid surfaces has attracted plenty of interest yet most of them are limited to one or two direction(s), while transport in three dimensions is largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate three&#8208;dimensionally steered dynamic liquid mobility at nanoporous liquid crystal polymer coatings. To this end, we orchestrate liquid motion via sequential triggers of light and/or electric field. Upon a primary flood exposure to UV light, liquid is ejected globally over the entire coating surfaces. We further reallocate the secreted liquid by applying a secondary electric field stimulus. By doing so, the liquid is transported and collected at pre&#8208;set positions as determined by the electrode positions. We further monitor this process in real&#8208;time and perform precise analysis. Interestingly, when applying those two triggers simultaneously, we discover a UV&#8208;gated liquid&#8208;release effect, which decreases threshold voltage as well as threshold frequency.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant progress in recent years. Innovations in material design and device optimization have improved the power conversion efficiencies to over 19%. In this review, based on recent advances, we discuss molecular design strategies to tune the absorption spectrum, energy level, and intermolecular aggregation as well as highlight the role of molecular electrostatic potential in decreasing energy loss. Then, we introduce the latest progress in four types of OSCs composed of different donor:acceptor combinations: polymer donor:small&#8208;molecule acceptor, all&#8208;polymer, all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule, and small&#8208;molecule donor:polymer acceptor OSCs. Finally, the challenges of OSCs in practical applications, including material cost, stability, and multi&#8208;function integration, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Depletion of Tumorigenic Energy Sources Driven by Cascade Reactions for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose and lactate play important roles for tumor growth. How to simultaneously deprive glucose and lactate of tumors is a big challenge. Herein, we developed a cascade catalytic system (denoted as FPGLC) based on fluorinated polymer (FP) with co&#8208;loading of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx) and catalase (CAT). GOx and LOx deprive glucose and lactate, respectively, resulting in abundant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Meanwhile, CAT catalyzes H2O2 into O2, which not only promotes catalytic reactions of GOx and LOx for consuming more glucose and lactate, but also alleviates tumor hypoxia. Benefiting from the excellent cross&#8208;membrane and transmucosal penetration capacities of FP, FPGLC rapidly accumulated in tumors and subsequently mediated enhanced cascade catalytic therapy under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. These results demonstrate that the dual&#8208;depletion of glucose and lactate with O2 supply is a promising strategy for efficient antitumor starvation therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemically Generated Calcium&#8208;Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium&#8208;based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents. This method will allow synthetic chemists to readily access the novel and unique reactivity of organocalcium nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Addition Reactions of Alkylarenes to Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation with Michael acceptors was achieved. The catalyst is proposed to activate the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating benzylic deprotonation and addition of the resulting carbanion to the electrophile in the absence of a base. This byproduct&#8208;free method features a wide scope of alkylarenes bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary benzylic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The use of alkylarenes as nucleophile precursors in benzylic addition is challenging because the benzylic hydrogen atoms of these compounds are inert to deprotonation. Herein, we report Rh&#8208;catalyzed benzylic addition of alkylarenes to Michael acceptors for the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds. The catalyst is proposed to activate the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating deprotonation of the unactivated benzylic C&#8722;H bond and addition of the resulting carbanion to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated double bond in the absence of bases. Notably, this byproduct&#8208;free method provides an access to all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through the development of ligands.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Molybdenum&#8211;N3 Sites for Selective Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for CO2  hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is desired yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report that single Mo atoms with a MoN3  (pyrrolic) moiety enable remarkable CO2  adsorption and hydrogenation to CO, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by a high and stable conversion of CO2  reaching about 30.4% with a CO selectivity of almost 100% at 500 &#176;C and very low H  2  partial pressure. Atomically dispersed MoN3  is calculated to facilitate CO2  activation and reduces CO2  to CO* via the direct dissociation path. Furthermore, the highest transition state energy in CO formation is 0.82 eV, substantially lower than that of CH4  formation (2.16 eV), accounting for the dominant yield of CO. The enhanced catalytic performances of Mo/NC originate from facile CO desorption with the help of the lack of atomic ensemble in Mo/NC. The resulting catalyst preserves good stability without degradation of CO2  conversion rate even after 68 h of continuous reaction. This finding provides a promising route for the construction of highly active, selective, and robust single&#8208;atom non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for reverse water gas shift reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Driven Rotatory Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are a major step towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light&#8208;induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task. In this review, an overview of approaches towards the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of different classes of atropisomers which can undergo controlled switching or rotation under the influence of a chemical stimulus is presented. They are categorized into molecular switches, rotors, motors and autonomous motors according to their type of responses. Furthermore, we provide a future perspective and challenges focusing on building sophisticated molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Sulfonium&#8208;Stabilized High&#8208;Efficiency Cesium or Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new X&#8208;type ligand, i.e., organic sulfonium bromide, for high&#8208;efficiency CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). We first confirmed the facile synthesis of the titled ligands in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at room temperature. By reacting dodecylmethylsulfide with allyl bromide, (3&#8208;bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane, and 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane, respectively, three representative ligands (named DAM, DSM, and DMM) are acquired. All of them result in CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 PNCs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and decent ambient stability (no less than 90% PLQY after 2 months) using a room&#8208;temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation technique. Among them, DSM and DMM endow CsPbBr3 PNCs with higher thermal/light stability arising from the cross&#8208;linkable or bidentate ligand structure. Further, DSM&#8208;CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene through in situ thermal polymerization and the composite shows a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8%.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Quenchers for F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Structure, Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanism to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, which are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This review is in prospected of providing suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8208;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible imaging probes that allow for the dynamic visualization of the redox cycle between hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are vital to probe the redox imbalance&#8208;involved pathological process in vivo. Herein, we report a reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging nanoprobe (1&#8208;PAIN) for the real&#8208;time imaging of &#8226;OH/H2S redox cycle in vivo. 1&#8208;PAIN displays a low PA ratio between 690 and 825 nm (PA690/PA825), which significantly increases by ~5&#8208;fold upon oxidation by &#8226;OH, and is switched back to the initially low PA690/PA825 value upon reduction by H2S. Taking the reversibility of 1&#8208;PAIN toward &#8226;OH/H2S redox couple, dynamic monitoring of the hepatic &#8226;OH and H2S fluctuation in mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS)&#8208;induced hepatitis and the following anti&#8208;inflammation process upon N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment is achieved. 1&#8208;PAIN can act as a useful tool to probe the redox state in living biology, beneficial for the study of redox imbalance&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The application of an alkyne cyclotrimerization regime with an [Fe(salen)]  2  &#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo (  1  ) catalyst to triphenylmethylphosphaalkyne (  2  ) yields access to gram&#8208;scale quantities of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(triphenylmethyl)&#8208;Dewar&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene (  3  ). Bulky lithium salt LiHMDS facilitates a rearrangement of  3  to the 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene valence isomer (  3&#8217;  ), which subsequently undergoes an intriguing phosphorus migration reaction to form the ring&#8208;contracted species (  3&#8217;&#8217;  ). Density functional theory calculations provide a plausible mechanism for this rearrangement. Given the stability of  3  , a diverse array of unprecedented transformations was investigated. We report novel crystallographically characterized products of successful nucleophilic/electrophilic addition and protonation/oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Semisynthesis of Homogeneous, Active Granulocyte Colony&#8208;Stimulating Factor Glycoforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G&#8208;CSF) is a cytokine used to treat neutropenia. Different glycosylated and non&#8208;glycosylated variants of G&#8208;CSF for therapeutic application are currently generated by recombinant expression. Here, we describe our approaches to establish a first semisynthesis strategy to access the aglycone and  O  &#8208;glycoforms of G&#8208;CSF, thereby enabling the preparation of selectively and homogeneously posttranslationally modified variants of this important cytokine. Eventually, we succeeded by combining selenocysteine ligation of a recombinantly produced N&#8208;terminal segment with a synthetic C&#8208;terminal part, transiently equipped with a sidechain&#8208;linked, photocleavable PEG moiety, at low concentration. The transient PEGylation enabled quantitative enzymatic elongation of the carbohydrate at Thr 133. Overall, we were able to significantly reduce the problems related to the low solubility and the tendency to aggregate of the two protein segments, which allowed the preparation of four G&#8208;CSF variants that were successfully folded and demonstrated biological activity in cell proliferation assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Macrocycles with Fixed Chirality and Two Distinct Sides: Dipole&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of symmetry is fundamental in molecular design with aimed properties. Herein we report a set of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with variable dipolar structures based on a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle, pillar[5]arene. Incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing ester groups formed an explicit two&#8208;sided structure, leading to increase in response wavelength and luminescence efficiency. On the other hand, chiroptical measurement of separated enantiomers revealed that such a dipolar character diminished dissymmetry of the electronic transitions. By suppressing the dipole, the dissymmetry factor for luminescence was enhanced from 0.4&#215;10&#8211;3 to 5.1&#215;10&#8211;3 in a less dipolar methoxy&#8208;substituted molecule, which was larger than reported pillar[5]arene derivatives without C5&#8208;symmetry around one order of magnitude.</dc:description>

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultra&#8208;Microporosity for Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation at High Temperature and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of CO2/C2H2  to obtain pure C2H2  presents a challenge for the chemical industry. CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents are favored because of the convenient separation process. However, there are only a few CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO2  from CO2/C2H2  , and there is almost no research on CO2/C2H2  separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on  &#949;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO2/C2H2  at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO2  with almost no C2H2  taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO2/C2H2  , and highly pure C2H2  is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333 K with 18.12% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Bonding Oxidation Group and Ti&#8208;cluster to Synthesize a Porous Crystalline Catalyst for Selective Photo&#8208;oxidation Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is important due to its substitute&#8208;role in polyester&#8208;fabrication. Here, a kind of Ti&#8208;cluster based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling between Ti6&#8208;NH2 and benzotrithiophene tricarbaldehyde (BTT). The synergistic integration of them endows the nanosheet with visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and suitable photo&#8208;oxidation ability. Specifically, its photo&#8208;selectivity for HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA can be &gt;95% with ~100% conversion, which is more than 2, 5, and 10 times higher than MOF&#8208;901 (43%), Ti6&#8208;NH2 (19%) and under&#8208;darkness (9%), respectively. Notably, an O2&#8208;involved mechanism is proposed and the vital roles of Ti6&#8208;NH2 and BTT are verified by DFT calculations.

         <title>Differential Dihydrofunctionalization: A Dual Catalytic Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Alkynes, Alkenyl Bromides, and Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne. The synthesis of allylic boronate esters can be accomplished in the presence of a wide range of functional groups, including, esters, nitriles, alkyl halides, sulfonyl esters, acetals, protected terminal alkynes, aryl halides, and silyl ethers. Mechanistic experiments reveal the importance of subtle ligand effects on the performance of the palladium co&#8208;catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies of Platinum(II) Tweezers and a Guest System: From Discrete Molecules to High&#8208;Ordered Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest assembly process of a platinum(II) tweezers&#8211;guest system can be controlled by varying the solvent composition. The change in the assembly behavior from discrete host and guest molecules to high&#8208;ordered host&#8211;guest oligomers can be probed by drastic changes in the color from yellow to orange to green, demonstrating a three&#8208;state supramolecular system with potential application as a colorimetric micro&#8208;environment sensor.







Abstract
A series of platinum(II) calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular tweezers was synthesized. The studies of the host&#8211;guest association with a charge&#8208;neutral cyclometalated platinum(II) complex showed a drastic color change and the turning on of near&#8208;infrared emission resulting from Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Control of the host&#8211;guest assembly process by varying the solvent composition can lead to a change from discrete host and guest molecules to high&#8208;ordered host&#8211;guest oligomers with the formation of sheet&#8208;like nanostructures, demonstrating a rare example of three&#8208;state supramolecular host&#8211;guest system with high solubility in solvents of diverse polarity. The change in host&#8211;guest assembly behaviors could be probed by drastic color changes from yellow to orange to green. The present study provides insights into the systematic design of solvent&#8208;responsive molecular materials using molecular tweezers&#8208;directed host&#8211;guest assembly, with potential applications in colorimetric sensing of changes in the micro&#8208;environment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of platinum(II) calix[4]arene-based molecular tweezers was synthesized. The studies of the host&#8211;guest association with a charge-neutral cyclometalated platinum(II) complex showed a drastic color change and the turning on of near-infrared emission resulting from Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Control of the host&#8211;guest assembly process by varying the solvent composition can lead to a change from discrete host and guest molecules to high-ordered host&#8211;guest oligomers with the formation of sheet-like nanostructures, demonstrating a rare example of three-state supramolecular host&#8211;guest system with high solubility in solvents of diverse polarity. The change in host&#8211;guest assembly behaviors could be probed by drastic color changes from yellow to orange to green. The present study provides insights into the systematic design of solvent-responsive molecular materials using molecular tweezers-directed host&#8211;guest assembly, with potential applications in colorimetric sensing of changes in the micro-environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role&#8208;Specialized Division of Labor in CO2 Reduction with Doubly&#8208;Functionalized Iron Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe porphyrin decorated with two cationic units in a cis&#8208;arrangement was synthesized and showed exceptional high activity for the electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Theoretical studies revealed that the two cationic units function differently but cooperatively to promote the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. This work presents a significant example of synthetic catalysts, which use a role&#8208;specialized division of labor strategy in small&#8208;molecule activation.







Abstract
In enzymes, the active site residues function differently to promote chemical reactions. Such a role&#8208;specialized division of labor has been rarely realized by synthetic catalysts. We report herein on catalytic CO2 reduction with Fe porphyrins decorated with two cationic N,N,N&#8208;trimethylbenzylamine groups in cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;arrangement. The cis&#8208;isomer outperforms the trans&#8208;isomer and reaches a TOFmax of 4.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in acetonitrile using phenol proton source. Theoretical studies revealed that the two cationic units in the cis&#8208;isomer are more effective than a single cationic unit to improve the CO2 binding, and more importantly, they function differently but cooperatively to promote the C&#8722;O bond cleavage: one interacts with the CO2&#8208;adduct, while the other one interacts with the phenol molecule through electrostatic interactions. This work therefore presents a significant example of synthetic catalysts, which boost chemical reactions using a role&#8208;specialized strategy for substrate activation.

         <title>Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Near&#8208;Infrared Electron Acceptors for Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric and asymmetric near&#8208;infrared double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers based on a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (TPD) core with 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC) side units were successfully synthesized for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). The asymmetric polymer exhibited improved hole mobility, leading to SCOSCs with high quantum efficiencies over 0.80 and power conversion efficiencies over 10&#8201;%.







Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electron acceptors are synthesized for use in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Through the development of a judicious synthetic pathway, the highly sensitive nature of the 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC)&#8208;based electron acceptors in basic and protonic solvents is overcome. In addition, an asymmetric design motif is adopted to optimize the packing of donor and acceptor segments, enhancing charge separation efficiency. As such, the new double&#8208;cable polymers are successfully applied in SCOSCs, providing an efficiency of over 10&#8201;% with a broad photo response from 300 to 850&#8197;nm and exhibiting excellent thermal/light stability. These results demonstrate the powerful design of NIR&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based double&#8208;cable polymers and will enable SCOSCs to enter a new stage.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer: A New Way to Develop a High&#8208;Performance Fluorescence Sensing Film towards Opto&#8208;Electronically Inert Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of an o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based U&#8208;shaped fluorophore possessing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) properties enables the development of a fluorescence film sensor, which allows high&#8208;performance sensing of opto&#8208;electronically inert alkanes vapors. This is ascribed to the microenvironmental sensitivity of the fluorophore and the facilitated mass transfer in the film state.







Abstract
New strategies are in high demand for fast, sensitive, selective, on&#8208;site and real&#8208;time detection of the important but challenging alkane vapors owing to their opto&#8208;electronic inertness. Herein, we report, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance fluorescent film sensor (FFS) for the alkanes with a rationally designed through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) molecule as the sensing fluorophore. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence, femto&#8208;second transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical studies revealed continuous TSCT dynamics in the excited U&#8208;shaped molecule with increasing medium polarity. Furthermore, the interlocked, face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment between the donor and acceptor favors mass transport of the analyte molecules in the film state. As anticipated, the compound&#8208;based FFS showed an experimental detection limit of &#8776;10&#8197;ppm for n&#8208;pentane, less than 5&#8197;s for a full detection, negligible interference and super&#8208;stability, revealing the effectiveness of the design strategy. Notably, the sensor is small (&#8776;3.7&#8197;cm3), power&#8208;saving, and workable at room temperature.

         <title>Highly Active and Thermally Robust Nickel Enolate Catalysts for the Synthesis of Ethylene&#8208;Acrylate Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of polar functionalities into the polyethylene backbone via coordination copolymerization can provide value&#8208;added polyolefins with improved properties. Nickel enolate catalysts with steric constraints in the axial positions were developed and applied to polyolefin synthesis. They are highly active (up to 7.7&#215;103&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and thermally stable in ethylene/acrylate copolymerization, and their behavior correlates with the level of axial shielding.







Abstract
The insertion copolymerization of polar olefins and ethylene remains a significant challenge in part due to catalysts&#8242; low activity and poor thermal stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy toward addressing these obstacles through ligand design. Neutral nickel phosphine enolate catalysts with large phosphine substituents reaching the axial positions of Ni achieve activity of up to 7.7&#215;103&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (efficiency &gt;35&#215;103&#8197;g copolymer/g Ni) at 110&#8201;&#176;C, notable for ethylene/acrylate copolymerization. NMR analysis of resulting copolymers reveals highly linear microstructures with main&#8208;chain ester functionality. Structure&#8208;performance studies indicate a strong correlation between axial steric hindrance and catalyst performance.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Semiconductor&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Nano Hybrids for Sustainable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion with High Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient reduction of CO2 to CH4 by a designed bio&#8208;nano hybrid with high product selectivity and record quantum yield is reported. In this process, distinct capacitance and conductive effects promote electron storage and redistribution. This work sheds light on the development of sustainable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion to meet environmental and energy requirements.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;nano hybrids with methanogens and nano&#8208;semiconductors provide an innovative strategy for solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion; however, the efficiency mismatch between electron production and utilisation results in low quantum yield and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we report the integration of metal&#8208;free polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx) decorated with cyanamide (NCN) groups and Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The self&#8208;assembled M. b&#8208;NCNCNx exhibited a quantum yield of 50.3&#8201;% with 92.3&#8201;% CH4 selectivity under illumination, which outperforms other reported bio&#8208;nano hybrid systems and photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction. This excellent performance was attributed to the distinct capacitance and conductive effects of NCNCNx, which promoted electron storage and redistribution at the biotic&#8211;abiotic interface to alleviate recombination losses and side reaction. This study provides new design guidelines for bio&#8208;nano hybrids for the sustainable photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into fuels.

         <title>Combinatorial Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Cages with Systematically Fine&#8208;Tuned Cavities for Efficient Co&#8208;Encapsulation and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combinatorial self&#8208;assembly approach with enPd(NO3)2 and three different ligands is demonstrated by Li&#8208;Xuan Cai, Qihui Chen, Qing&#8208;Fu Sun and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204732). Controllable arrangement of different ligands not only gives rise to a family of six different palladium&#8208;organic cages with systematically varied shapes and cavities, but also brings emergent host&#8211;guest chemistry on the heteroleptic cages due to the fusion of two half cavities from their parent homoleptic cages.

         <title>Cathodic Radical Cyclisation of Aryl Halides Using a Strongly&#8208;Reducing Catalytic Mediator in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic radical cyclisations of aryl halides have been achieved in an undivided flow electrolysis cell, using phenanthrene as mediator in loadings down to 0.05&#8197;equiv, and without the requirement for a sacrificial anode. It is proposed that mediated homogeneous electron transfer proceeds in a reaction layer detached from the cathode, accounting for the observed selectivity.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reductive radical cyclisation of aryl halides affords the corresponding hetero&#8208; and carbo&#8208;cycles in an undivided flow reactor equipped with steel and carbon electrodes using an organic mediator. A dissolving metal anode is not needed, and the mediator can be employed in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount (0.05&#8197;equiv), increasing the practical utility of cathodic radical cyclisation. The methodology is applied to O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;tethers, yielding tricyclic fused and spiro systems. In the absence of mediator, the major pathway is hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;X bond, a 2&#8201;e&#8722; process occurring at the cathode. Predominance of the radical pathway in presence of a strongly reducing mediator (M) is consistent with homogeneous electron&#8208;transfer in a reaction layer detached from the cathode surface, where the flux of M.&#8722; leaving the electrode is such that little aryl halide reaches the cathode.

Predominance of the radical pathway in presence of a strongly reducing mediator (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;) is consistent with homogeneous electron-transfer in a reaction layer detached from the cathode surface, where the flux of &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; leaving the electrode is such that little aryl halide reaches the cathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Encapsulated within Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallacycles embrace carbon nanotubes: The encapsulation of SWNTs within a Pd&#8208;based metallosquare featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene ligands is described. It is found that the formation of MINTs with this type of metallo&#8208;assembly is very sensitive to structural variations, but with the correct one it proceeds successfully both by &#8220;clipping&#8221; and &#8220;threading&#8221; strategies.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked derivatives of carbon nanotubes (MINTs) are interesting nanotube products since they show high stability without altering the carbon nanotube structure. So far, MINTs have been synthesized using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, disulfide exchange reaction, H&#8208;bonding or direct threading with macrocycles. Here, we describe the encapsulation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes within a palladium&#8208;based metallosquare. The formation of MINTs was confirmed by a variety of techniques, including high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find the making of these MINTs is remarkably sensitive to structural variations of the metallo&#8208;assemblies. When a metallosquare with a cavity of appropriate shape and size is used, the formation of the MINT proceeds successfully by both templated clipping and direct threading. Our studies also show indications on how supramolecular coordination complexes can help expand the potential applications of MINTs.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Conversion of Dinitrogen to Benzonitrile: Selectivity Control by Electrophile&#8208; versus Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the conversion of N2 to benzonitrile within a simple two&#8208;step cycle is demonstrated. Photoelectrochemical, reductive splitting of N2 is mediated by a Re pincer complex. The resulting ReV nitride undergoes electrochemical N&#8208;atom transfer in the presence of benzoyl bromide and acid at mild potentials. The high selectivity with respect to nitrile formation is attributed to the unfavorable thermochemistry of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the nitride.







Abstract
Nitride complexes are key species in homogeneous nitrogen fixation to NH3 via stepwise proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). In contrast, direct generation of nitrogenous organic products from N2&#8208;derived nitrides requires new strategies to enable efficient reductive nitride transfer in the presence of organic electrophiles. We here present a 2&#8208;step protocol for the conversion of dinitrogen to benzonitrile. Photoelectrochemical, reductive N2 splitting produces a rhenium(V) nitride with unfavorable PCET thermochemistry towards ammonia generation. However, N&#8208;benzoylation stabilizes subsequent reduction as a basis for selective nitrogen transfer in the presence of the organic electrophile and Br&#248;nsted acid at mild reduction potentials. This work offers a new strategy for photoelectrosynthetic nitrogen fixation beyond ammonia&#8212;to yield nitrogenous organic products.

         <title>Asymmetric Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Hydroarylation&#8211;Nazarov Cyclization: Enantioselective Access to Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new enantioselective version of the Nazarov cyclization is reported. The reaction design uses readily available alkenynones to trigger a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Michael hydroarylation of the ynone followed by Nazarov cyclization. A chiral gold complex is able to control the absolute stereochemistry of the process. Cyclopenta[c]chromenones, which combine the 2H&#8208;chromene and cylopentanone cores, are synthesized with high yields and ee values.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of cyclopentachromenones from gold&#8208;catalyzed reaction of readily available skipped alkenynones is described. This cascade reaction involves an initial anti&#8208;Michael hydroarylation of the ynone moiety to form a gold&#8208;functionalized dialkenylketone intermediate, followed by a Nazarov cyclization that proceeds in an unprecedented enantioselective manner. Excellent enantiomeric ratios and chemical yields are obtained under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive, Selective and Repeatable Fluorescence Sensor for Methanol Based on a Highly Emissive 0D Hybrid Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
0D hybrid lead&#8208;free halide displays highly efficient broadband green light emission with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and acts as a unique fluorescence sensor for methanol in ethanol with ultrahigh selectivity, sensitivity and repeatability as well as fast response time.







Abstract
A convenient and rapid detection method for methanol in ethanol remains a major challenge due to their indistinguishable physical properties. Herein, a novel fluorescence probe based on perovskite was successfully designed to overcome this bottleneck. We report a new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid perovskite of [MP]2InxSb1&#8722;xCl7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O (MP=2&#8208;methylpiperazine) displaying an unusual green light emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Remarkably, this 0D perovskite exhibits reversible methanol&#8208;response luminescence switching between green and yellow color but fail in any other organic vapors. Even for blended alcohol solutions, the luminescent probe exhibits excellent sensing performance with multiple superiorities of rapid response time (30&#8197;s) and ultra&#8208;low detection limit (40&#8197;ppm), etc. Therefore, this 0D perovskite can be utilized as a perfect fluorescence probe to detect traces of methanol from ethanol with ultrahigh sensitivity, selectivity and repeatability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first perovskite as fluorescence probe for methanol with wide potential in environmental monitoring and methanol detection, etc.

         <title>Hexagonal Planar [B6H6] within a [B6H12] Borate Complex: Structure and Bonding of [(Cp*Ti)2(&#956;&#8208;&#627;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#627;6&#8208;B6H6)(&#956;&#8208;H)6]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexagonal borane [B6H6] ring supported by six B&#8722;H&#8722;Ti bonds in the coordination sphere of {Cp*Ti} fragments is formed from the reaction of [Cp*TiCl3] with [LiBH4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF] followed by thermolysis in presence of an excess of [BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF].







Abstract
Isolation of planar [B6H6] is a long&#8208;awaited goal in boron chemistry. Several attempts in the past to stabilize [B6H6] were unsuccessful due to the domination of polyhedral geometries. Herein, we report the synthesis of a triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex of titanium [(Cp*Ti)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;6&#8208;B6H6)(&#956;&#8208;H)6] (1), which features the first&#8208;ever experimentally achieved nearly planar six&#8208;membered [B6H6] ring, albeit within a [B6H12] borate. The small deviation from planarity is a direct consequence of the predicted structural pattern of the middle ring in 24 Valence Electron Count (VEC) triple&#8208;decker complexes. The large ring size of [B6H6] in 1 brings the metal&#8211;metal distance into the bonding range. However, significant electron delocalization from the M&#8722;M bonding orbital to the bridging hydrogen and B&#8722;B skeleton in the middle decreases its bond strength.

         <title>Stabilization of Imines and Hemiaminals in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Container Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8208;functionalized naphthotube featuring a cavity with both hydrogen bonding sites and hydrophobic surfaces has been developed that traps aldehydes in bulk aqueous solution through the formation of hemiaminals. Dehydration of the hemiaminal to the imine is favored by the release of water from the hydrophobic microenvironment. Both the hemiaminals and imines could be detected by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry at room temperature.







Abstract
Stabilizing water&#8208;sensitive reaction intermediates is challenging but desirable for guiding reactions to desired products in water. Herein, we report that labile imine and hemiaminal functional groups can be stabilized inside a synthetic container compound, a water&#8208;soluble naphthotube. The naphthotube features a primary amine group anchored in a cavity with both hydrogen bonding sites and hydrophobic surfaces. Aldehydes in bulk aqueous solution are trapped in the cavity by the amine to form hemiaminals stabilized through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects. Dehydration of the hemiaminal to the imine is favored by the release of water from the hydrophobic microenvironment. Both the hemiaminals and imines can be detected at room temperature by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

         <title>Synergistic Mechanism of Platinum&#8208;GaOx Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic mechanism of Pt&#8208;modified Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation is discussed. The presence of Pt can assist H2 dissociation and increase the surface coverage of hydrogen species, which promotes the propylene production. The research provides guidance for the rational design of metal&#8211;metal oxide catalysts.







Abstract
The synergy between metals and metal oxides can effectively improve the heterogeneous catalytic process. This paper describes the intrinsic effect of Pt modification over GaOx (Pt&#8722;GaOx) on propane dehydrogenation. The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of C&#8722;H in propane. With excessive Pt, Ga&#948;+ can be further reduced to form Pt&#8722;Ga alloy with less surface hydrogen species. Consequently, the relative propylene formation rate between Pt&#8722;GaOx and the summed contribution of individual Pt and GaOx increases linearly with the content of hydrogen species. Optimally, the relative propylene formation rate of Pt&#8722;GaOx with 0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exceeds 25&#8201;% of the summed contribution of individual components.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal dual photoredox catalysis platform based on metal&#8211;organic polymers synergistically constructed with triphenylpyrylium mimic ligands and reductive metal ions is reported by Yunhe Jin, Chunying Duan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204918). This novel strategy enables integration of photoinduced electron transfer and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer events, and spatial and kinetic confinement effects of structurally confined pores for enhanced efficiency in photocatalysis of various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation.

         <dc:description>Highly efficient biological ion channels with sophisticated transport characteristics in living organisms have inspired the design of artificial channels that are functionally comparable to those of their natural counterparts and applicable on a much larger scale. To date, self&#8208;assembly offers a facile process for producing nanoconfined ion channels that exhibit smart ion transport properties, including ion selectivity, gating, and rectification, showing great potential for various applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of strategies for engineering bioinspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels. We focus on emerging channel assemblies based on different fabrication processes such as supramolecular assembly, nanosystem&#8208;based fabrication, and polymer&#8208;based integration. The applications of these bioinspired channels, in exploration of physiological events, detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion, are concisely presented. Finally, the future developments and challenges of this booming research field are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Diborylmethyl Group as a Transformable Building Block for the Diversification of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new approaches to installing diverse carbon fragments to a nitrogen atom has attracted considerable attention in chemical science. While numerous strategies have been devised to forge C(sp  3  )&#8208;N bonds, one conceptually powerful and straightforward approach is to insert a transformable sp  3  &#8208;carbon unit onto a nitrogen atom for modular diversification. Here we describe the successful synthesis of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their applications to the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes through their homologative coupling with a variety of nitrogen nucleophiles including biologically relevant molecules. This process exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, and the usefulness of the obtained compounds is demonstrated by the modular diversification of the diborylmethyl group to access various nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Organic Cathodes for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries through Electron Cloud and Solvation Structure Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during this process. Based on the Nernst equation, a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change of the redox process was proposed that improved the output voltage of organosulfur&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries from 0.8&#8197;V to 1.7&#8197;V.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active organic materials, as a new generation of sustainable resources, are receiving increasing attention in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their resource abundance and tunable structure. However, organic molecules with high potential are rare, and the voltage of most reported organic cathode&#8208;based ZIBs is less than 1.2&#8197;V. Herein, we explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during the process. Then, we proposed a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change and eventually improve the output voltage of the organic electrode. Combining the regulation of the electron cloud of organic molecules and the manipulation of the solvation structure, the output voltage of an organosulfur compound based ZIB was greatly increased from 0.8&#8197;V to 1.7&#8197;V. Our results put forward a specific pathway to improve the working voltage and lay the foundation for the practical application of organic electrodes.

         <title>Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence of Lanthanide in Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskites via Breakdown of the Local Site Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide&#8208;doped double perovskites (DPs) of Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Ln3+ is proposed. By virtue of the Na+&#8208;induced breakdown of the local site symmetry, optimal absolute NIR photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 19.0&#8201;% and 4.3&#8201;% for Yb3+ and Er3+, respectively, are achieved in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6 DPs through the effective sensitization of Bi3+.







Abstract
Currently, lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting double perovskites (DPs) suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we develop a new class of NIR&#8208;emitting DPs based on Ln3+&#8208;doped Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6. Benefiting from the Na+&#8208;induced breakdown of local site symmetry in the Cs2AgBiCl6 DPs, effective NIR emissions of Ln3+ are realized through Bi3+ sensitization. Specifically, 7.3&#8208;fold and 362.9&#8208;fold enhanced NIR emissions of Yb3+ and Er3+ are achieved in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6 DPs relative to those in Na&#8208;free Cs2AgBiCl6 counterparts, respectively. The optimal absolute NIR PLQYs for Yb3+ and Er3+ in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6 DPs are determined to be 19.0&#8201;% and 4.3&#8201;%, respectively. Raman spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations verify the sublattice distortion in Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6 DPs via Na+ doping. These findings provide fundamental insights into the design of efficient NIR&#8208;emitting Ln3+&#8208;doped DPs for versatile optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Fluorinated Isochromans via Iodine(I)/Iodine(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral II/IIII catalysis platform is reported to facilitate the fluorocyclization of 2&#8208;vinyl benzaldehydes thereby generating novel fluorinated isochromans in a single operation (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;05 d.r. and 97&#8201;:&#8201;03 e.r.). Not only does the benzylic fluoride shield an oxidatively labile position, X&#8208;ray analyses demonstrate that the [CH2&#8208;CHF] fragment functions as a stereoelectronic mimic of the O&#8208;CH(OR) acetal motif.







Abstract
The success of saturated, fluorinated heterocycles in contemporary drug discovery provides a stimulus for creative endeavor in main group catalysis. Motivated by the ubiquity of isochromans across the bioactive small molecule spectrum, the prominence of the anomeric effect in regulating conformation, and the metabolic lability of the benzylic position, iodine(I)/iodine(III) catalysis has been leveraged for the stereocontrolled generation of selectively fluorinated analogs. To augment the current arsenal of fluorocyclization reactions involving carboxylic acid derivatives, the reaction of readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl benzaldehydes is disclosed (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;05 d.r. and 97&#8201;:&#8201;03 e.r.). Key stereoelectronic interactions manifest themselves in the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the products, thereby validating the [CH2&#8208;CHF] fragment as a stereoelectronic mimic of the [O&#8208;CH(OR)] acetal motif.

         <title>Unravelling the Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence Mechanism of a Fluorescein&#8208;Based Probe in GABAA Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescein&#8208;based imaging probe turns&#8208;on upon binding to the human &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. Multiscale calculations show that fluorescence is due to the rod&#8208;like conformation of the probe within the receptor. In contrast, intramolecular &#960;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions in the folded conformation present in solution quench emission.







Abstract
GABAA (&#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid type A) receptors are ligand&#8208;gated ion channels mediating fast inhibitory transmission in the mammalian brain. Here we report the molecular and electronic mechanism governing the turn&#8208;on emission of a fluorescein&#8208;based imaging probe able to target the human GABAA receptor. Multiscale calculations evidence a drastic conformational change of the probe from folded in solution to extended upon binding to the receptor. Intramolecular &#960;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions present in the folded probe are responsible for quenching fluorescence in solution. In contrast, unfolding within the GABAA receptor changes the nature of the bright excited state triggering emission. Remarkably, this turn&#8208;on effect only manifests for the dianionic prototropic form of the imaging probe, which is found to be the strongest binder to the GABAA receptor. This study is expected to assist the design of new photoactivatable screening tools for allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor.

         <title>Growth of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Assemblies on Cu(100) and Cu(111): From Single Molecules to Magic&#8208;Number Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adsorbs on Cu(100) and Cu(111) leading to different nanostructures. On Cu(111), the combination of intermolecular interactions and commensurability promotes the formation of magic&#8208;number islands. The understanding of this self&#8208;assembly process represents important progress for the design of tailormade N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) assemblies.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have superior properties as building blocks of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs). Understanding the influence of the substrate in the molecular arrangement is a fundamental step before employing these ligands in technological applications. Herein, we study the molecular arrangement of a model NHC on Cu(100) and Cu(111). While mostly disordered phases appear on Cu(100), on Cu(111) well&#8208;defined structures are formed, evolving from magic&#8208;number islands to molecular ribbons with coverage. This work presents the first example of magic&#8208;number islands formed by NHC assemblies on flat surfaces. Diffusion and commensurability are key factors explaining the observed arrangements. These results shed light on the molecule&#8208;substrate interaction and open the possibility of tuning nanopatterned structures based on NHC assemblies.

         <title>Enantiomorphic Single Crystals of Linear Lead(II) Bromide Perovskitoids with White Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
White circularly polarized emission based on lead(II) bromide perovskitoids was successfully achieved. The emission results from the synergistic combination of chiral organic cations and lead bromide inorganic anions. The chiral lead(II) bromide perovskitoids are obtained through a concise synthesis process, and they show excellent white&#8208;emission photoluminescence quantum yields and ultrastable persistence in ambient conditions.







Abstract
Chiroptical hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as a new class of promising materials with mirror optical signal responses for optoelectronic applications. However, chiroptical white&#8208;emission materials have been scarcely unearthed. Herein, four pairs of hybrid lead(II) bromide perovskitoids were obtained, namely, (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)PbBr4 (R/S&#8208;MPz=(R)&#8208;(&#8722;)/(S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpiperazine) (1 and 2), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)3Pb2Br10&#8901;2&#8201;DMAc (3 and 4), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)PbBr4&#8901;0.5&#8201;MeCN (5 and 6) and (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(H2MPz)2Pb2Br8&#8901;DCM (7 and 8). Notably, they all exhibit ultrabroadband emission and chiroptical signals. Perovskitoids 3&#8211;6 even achieve white circularly polarized emission with a high dissymmetric factor (glum) (&#177;3&#215;10&#8722;3 for 3 and 4; &#177;8&#215;10&#8722;3 for 5 and 6). This new type of hybrid perovskitoids will attract attention and find applications in chiroptical fields because of the extensively and easily tunable photophysical properties.

         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intermolecular hydrosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes promoted by an easily accessible Co complex to afford a wide range of enantioenriched acyclic silanes was developed. This protocol represents the first intermolecular example of simultaneous construction of a C&#8208; and a Si&#8208;stereogenic center through metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.







Abstract
One of the most straightforward approaches to access chiral silanes is catalytic enantioselective hydrosilylation. Although significant advances have been achieved in enantioselective construction of either a carbon&#8208;stereogenic center or a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center through enantioselective hydrosilylation, simultaneous establishment of a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in an acyclic molecule through a single intermolecular hydrosilylation remained undeveloped. Herein, an unprecedented cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes is presented, enabling construction of a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in a single intermolecular transformation. A wide range of chiral silanes bearing a carbon&#8208; and a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center were generated in high efficiency and stereoselectivity. Functionalization of the enantioenriched silanes delivered a variety of valuable chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access.

Whilst allowing for easy access to synthetically versatile motifs and for modification of bioactive molecules, the chemoselective benzylic oxidation reactions of functionalized alkyl arenes remain challenging. Reported in this study is a new non&#8208;heme Mn catalyst stabilized by a bipiperidine&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, which enables methylene oxidation of benzylic compounds by H2O2, showing high activity and excellent chemoselectivity under mild conditions. The protocol tolerates an unprecedentedly wide range of functional groups, including carboxylic acid and derivatives, ketone, cyano, azide, acetate, sulfonate, alkyne, amino acid, and amine units, thus providing a low&#8208;cost, more sustainable and robust pathway for the facile synthesis of ketones, increase of complexity of organic molecules, and late&#8208;stage modification of drugs.

         <title>A Tandem Dehydrogenation&#8208;Driven Cross&#8208;Coupling between Cyclohexanones and Primary Amines for Construction of Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling reaction between cyclohexanones and primary amines is reported for benzoxazole synthesis by TEMPO's multiple reactivity modes (oxygenation and desaturation). This transition metal&#8208;free protocol features broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and is operationally simple, therefore enabling late&#8208;stage functionalization and rapid synthesis of bioactive compounds, including structurally complex marketed drugs and natural products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free, operationally simple, general method for straightforward syntheses of 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles from readily available cyclohexanones and aliphatic primary amines by an imine &#945;&#8208;oxygenation&#8208;initiated cascade reaction sequence. The key to achieving high selectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance is the use of TEMPO as a mild oxidant that selectively oxidizes the reaction intermediates through its multiple reactivity modes, thus facilitating the individual steps to proceed in succession. More than 70 substrate combinations are disclosed, demonstrating the reliability of this protocol to synthesize structurally diverse products, including marketed drugs, drug candidate, and natural products that are unattainable by the existing methods.

         <title>Commonly Used Alkylating Agents Limit Persulfide Detection by Converting Protein Persulfides into Thioethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection and quantitation of protein persulfides requires trapping with alkylating agents. Persulfide adducts derived from commonly used alkylating agents are unstable under biologically relevant conditions. The adducts convert to thioethers by losing sulfane sulfur to nucleophilic acceptors. Alkylating agents that form stable persulfide adducts and are suitable for persulfide trapping in biological samples are also reported.







Abstract
Protein persulfides (R&#8208;S&#8208;SH) have emerged as a common post&#8208;translational modification. Detection and quantitation of protein persulfides requires trapping with alkylating agents. Here we show that alkylating agents differ dramatically in their ability to conserve the persulfide's sulfur&#8211;sulfur bond for subsequent detection by mass spectrometry. The two alkylating agents most commonly used in cell biology and biochemistry, N&#8208;ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide, are found to be unsuitable for the purpose of conserving persulfides under biologically relevant conditions. The resulting persulfide adducts (R&#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) rapidly convert into the corresponding thioethers (R&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) by donating sulfur to ambient nucleophilic acceptors. In contrast, certain other alkylating agents, in particular monobromobimane and N&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;iodoacetamide, generate stable alkylated persulfides. We propose that the nature of the alkylating agent determines the ability of the disulfide bond (R&#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) to tautomerize into the thiosulfoxide (R&#8208;(S=S)&#8208;Alk), and/or the ability of nucleophiles to remove the sulfane sulfur atom from the thiosulfoxide.

         <title>Stable Lead&#8208;Free Tin Halide Perovskite with Operational Stability &gt;1200&#8201;h by Suppressing Tin(II) Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free Cs4SnBr6 perovskites were obtained by using SnF2 as tin source. The doping of F ions can significantly suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in Cs4SnBr6 perovskites, thus achieving excellent stability against oxygen, moisture and light irradiation for 1200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Sn&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative materials for Pb&#8208;based perovskites to address the toxicity problem of lead. However, the development of SnII&#8208;based perovskites has been hindered by their extreme instability. Here, we synthesized efficient and stable lead&#8208;free Cs4SnBr6 perovskite by using SnF2 as tin source instead of easily oxidized SnBr2. The SnF2 configures a fluorine&#8208;rich environment, which can not only suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ in the synthesis, but also construct chemically stable Sn&#8722;F coordination to hinder the electron transfer from Sn2+ to oxygen within the long&#8208;term operation process. The SnF2&#8208;derived Cs4SnBr6 perovskite shows a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 62.8&#8201;%, and excellent stability against oxygen, moisture, and light radiation for 1200&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable lead&#8208;free perovskites. The results pave a new pathway to enhance the optical properties and stability of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;performance light emitters.

         <title>A Versatile Synthetic Affinity Probe Reveals Inhibitory Synapse Ultrastructure and Brain Connectivity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short dimerized peptidic probe for high contrast visualization of inhibitory synapses in neuron cultures and brain tissue is presented. The probe can be flexibly applied both for widefield and confocal 3D volumetric synapse visualization, for inhibitory circuits mapping in tissue and for super&#8208;resolution imaging of synapses.







Abstract
Visualization of inhibitory synapses requires protocol tailoring for different sample types and imaging techniques, and usually relies on genetic manipulation or the use of antibodies that underperform in tissue immunofluorescence. Starting from an endogenous ligand of gephyrin, a universal marker of the inhibitory synapse, we developed a short peptidic binder and dimerized it, significantly increasing affinity and selectivity. We further tailored fluorophores to the binder, yielding &#8220;Sylite&#8221;&#8212;a probe with outstanding signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio that outperforms antibodies in tissue staining with rapid and efficient penetration, mitigation of staining artifacts, and simplified handling. In super&#8208;resolution microscopy Sylite precisely localizes the inhibitory synapse and enables nanoscale measurements. Sylite profiles inhibitory inputs and synapse sizes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the midbrain and combined with complimentary tracing techniques reveals the synaptic connectivity.

         <title>Co&#8208;assembled Monolayers as Hole&#8208;Selective Contact for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Optimized Recombination Loss and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient hole selection interface with reduced recombination loss is achieved through co&#8208;assembly of a structurally engineered hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) and an ammonium passivator, with which a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.59&#8201;% and improved device stability are accomplished in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been widely employed as an effective way to modify interfaces of electronic/optoelectronic devices. To achieve a good control of the growth and molecular functionality of SAMs, we develop a co&#8208;assembled monolayer (co&#8208;SAM) for obtaining efficient hole selection and suppressed recombination at the hole&#8208;selective interface in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By engineering the position of methoxy substituents, an aligned energy level and favorable dipole moment can be obtained in our newly synthesized SAM, ((2,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) methyl) phosphonic acid (DC&#8208;PA). An alkyl ammonium containing SAM is co&#8208;assembled to further optimize the surface functionalization and interaction with perovskite layer on top. A champion device with an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.59&#8201;% and improved device stability are achieved. This work demonstrates the advantage of using co&#8208;SAM in improving performance and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and Perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) are Simple Synthons for Nitrosylated Iron Sulfur Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple Fe2+ ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool, react with thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) to yield synthons to biologically&#8208;relevant Fe&#8722;S clusters.







Abstract
S/N crosstalk species derived from the interconnected reactivity of H2S and NO facilitate the transport of reactive sulfur and nitrogen species in signaling, transport, and regulatory processes. We report here that simple Fe2+ ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool (LIP), react with thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;) to yield the dinitrosyl iron complex [Fe(NO)2(S5)]&#8722;. In the reaction of FeCl2 with SNO&#8722; we were able to isolate the unstable intermediate hydrosulfido mononitrosyl iron complex [FeCl2(NO)(SH)]&#8722;, which was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. We also show that [Fe(NO)2(S5)]&#8722; is a simple synthon for nitrosylated Fe&#8722;S clusters via its reduction with PPh3 to yield Roussin's Red Salt ([Fe2S2(NO)4]2&#8722;), which highlights the role of S/N crosstalk species in the assembly of fundamental Fe&#8722;S motifs.

         <title>Tailoring Coordination in Conventional Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Reversible Magnesium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation sheath rearrangement by tuning the Mg2+&#8208;solvents coordination is effectively applied in the magnesium conventional electrolyte. The passivation problem due to solvent decomposition caused by the strong coordination is solved.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries based on conventional electrolytes are seriously plagued by the formation of the ion&#8208;blocking passivation layer on the Mg metal anode. By tracking the Mg2+ solvation sheath, this work links the passivation components to the Mg2+&#8208;solvents (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, DME) coordination and the consequent thermodynamically unstable DME molecules. On this basis, we propose a methodology to tailor solvation coordination by introducing the additive solvent with extreme electron richness. Oxygen atoms in phosphorus&#8208;oxygen groups compete with that in carbon&#8208;oxygen groups of DME for the coordination with Mg2+, thus softening the solvation sheath deformation. Meanwhile, the organophosphorus molecules in the rearranged solvation sheath decompose on the Mg surface, increasing the Mg2+ transport and electrical resistance by three and one orders of magnitude, respectively. Consequently, the symmetric cells exhibit superior cycling performance of over 600&#8197;cycles with low polarization.

         <title>Switching Excited State Distribution of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Dramatically Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol was proposed to switch the excited state from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer to 3IL (intraligand) for dramatically improving the sensitizing ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Hierarchical integration of single&#8208;site catalysts into 3IL MOFs can directionally and rapidly steer electron transfer, leading to an extremely high H2 evolution activity and a record HCOOH yield among all the MOF photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photosensitization associated with electron/energy transfer represents the central science of natural photosynthesis. Herein, we proposed a protocol to dramatically improve the sensitizing ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by switching their excited state distribution from 3MLCT (metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer) to 3IL (intraligand). The hierarchical organization of 3IL MOFs and Co/Cu catalysts facilitates electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution with a yield of 26&#8201;844.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and CO2 photoreduction with a record HCOOH yield of 4807.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 among all the MOF photocatalysts. Systematic investigations demonstrate that strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorption, long&#8208;lived excited state and ingenious multi&#8208;component synergy in the 3IL MOFs can facilitate both interface and intra&#8208;framework electron transfer to boost photocatalysis. This work opens up an avenue to boost solar&#8208;energy conversion by engineering sensitizing centers at a molecular level.

         <title>Continuous Flow Preparation of Benzylic Sodium Organometallics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lateral sodiation of alkyl(hetero)arenes using on&#8208;demand generated (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium in the presence of TMEDA is reported. Various electrophiles were used for trapping of the benzyl sodium species generated in continuous flow as well as in batch. The continuous flow metalation was scaled&#8208;up using an in&#8208;line quench. The method was used in the synthesis of several industrial relevant compounds.







Abstract
We report a lateral sodiation of alkyl(hetero)arenes using on&#8208;demand generated hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (1) in the presence of TMEDA. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (1) is prepared via a sodium packed&#8208;bed reactor and used for metalations at ambient temperature in batch as well as in continuous flow. The resulting benzylic sodium species are subsequently trapped with various electrophiles including carbonyl compounds, epoxides, oxetane, allyl/benzyl chlorides, alkyl halides and alkyl tosylates. Wurtz&#8208;type couplings with secondary alkyl halides and tosylates proceed under complete inversion of stereochemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A lateral sodiation of alkyl(hetero)arenes using on-demand generated (2-ethylhexyl)sodium in the presence of TMEDA is reported. Various electrophiles were used for trapping of the benzyl sodium species generated in continuous flow as well as in batch. The continuous flow metalation was scaled-up using an in-line quench. The method was used in the synthesis of several industrial relevant compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a lateral sodiation of alkyl(hetero)arenes using on-demand generated hexane-soluble (2-ethylhexyl)sodium (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) in the presence of TMEDA. (2-Ethylhexyl)sodium (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is prepared via a sodium packed-bed reactor and used for metalations at ambient temperature in batch as well as in continuous flow. The resulting benzylic sodium species are subsequently trapped with various electrophiles including carbonyl compounds, epoxides, oxetane, allyl/benzyl chlorides, alkyl halides and alkyl tosylates. Wurtz-type couplings with secondary alkyl halides and tosylates proceed under complete inversion of stereochemistry. Furthermore, the utility of this lateral sodiation is demonstrated in the synthesis of pharmaceutical relevant compounds. Thus, fingolimod is prepared from &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene applying the lateral sodiation twice. In addition, 7-fold isotopically labeled salmeterol-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and fenpiprane as well as precursors to super linear alkylbenzene (SLAB) surfactants are prepared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture at Nucleophilic Hydroxide Sites in Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon capture and sequestration is needed to fight global climate change, but current technologies are largely limited to sorbents based on oxidatively sensitive amines. Hydroxides encapsulated within cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks are demonstrated to capture CO2 via reversible bicarbonate formation, leading to a promising oxidatively stable class of materials for CO2 capture from industrial point sources.







Abstract
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from industrial point sources and direct air capture are necessary to combat global climate change. A particular challenge faced by amine&#8208;based sorbents&#8212;the current leading technology&#8212;is poor stability towards O2. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 chemisorption in &#947;&#8208;cylodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (CD&#8208;MOFs) occurs via HCO3&#8722; formation at nucleophilic OH&#8722; sites within the framework pores, rather than via previously proposed pathways. The new framework KHCO3 CD&#8208;MOF possesses rapid and high&#8208;capacity CO2 uptake, good thermal, oxidative, and cycling stabilities, and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions. Because of its low cost and performance under realistic conditions, KHCO3 CD&#8208;MOF is a promising new platform for CCS. More broadly, our work demonstrates that the encapsulation of reactive OH&#8722; sites within a porous framework represents a potentially general strategy for the design of oxidation&#8208;resistant adsorbents for CO2 capture.

         <title>Manipulating the Water Dissociation Electrocatalytic Sites of Bimetallic Nickel&#8208;Based Alloys for Highly Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved d&#8208;band model is presented as a valid descriptor to reflect hollow&#8208;site adsorption and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity for multi&#8208;elemental alloy catalysts. NiCu was found to have a near&#8208;optimal &#916;GH value and the introduction of O atoms into the Ni&#8722;Cu surface could accelerate water dissociation. Tailoring electrocatalytic sites for water dissociation can synergistically complete the multi&#8208;step reactions of alkaline HER.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal alloys are currently drawing increasing attention as promising electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, traditional density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory&#8208;derived d&#8208;band theory fails to describe the hydrogen adsorption energy (&#916;GH) on hollow sites. Herein, by studying the &#916;GH for a series of Ni&#8722;M (M=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, W) bimetallic alloys, an improved d&#8208;band center was provided and a potential NiCu electrocatalyst with a near&#8208;optimal &#916;GH was discovered. Moreover, oxygen atoms were introduced into Ni&#8722;M (O&#8722;NiM) to balance the adsorption/desorption of hydroxyl species. The tailored electrocatalytic sites for water dissociation can synergistically accelerate the multi&#8208;step alkaline HER. The prepared O&#8722;NiCu shows the optimum HER activity with a low overpotential of 23&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work not only broadens the applicability of d&#8208;band theory, but also provides crucial understanding for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Ligand Targeting the &#946;1&#8208;Adrenoceptor Enables Light&#8208;Control of the Cardiac Rhythm
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New azobenzene&#8208;based molecular photoswitches active for the therapeutic &#946;1&#8208;adrenoceptor (&#946;1&#8208;AR) are presented. The most promising candidate, named pAzo&#8208;2, has a potency and &#946;1/&#946;2 selectivity similar to approved beta blockers. Importantly, pAzo&#8208;2 is compatible with imaging techniques and its potential as a cardioselective light&#8208;controlled drug has been validated by the reversible photomodulation of the cardiac rhythm in living zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
Catecholamine&#8208;triggered &#946;&#8208;adrenoceptor (&#946;&#8208;AR) signaling is essential for the correct functioning of the heart. Although both &#946;1&#8208; and &#946;2&#8208;AR subtypes are expressed in cardiomyocytes, drugs selectively targeting &#946;1&#8208;AR have proven this receptor as the main target for the therapeutic effects of beta blockers in the heart. Here, we report a new strategy for the light&#8208;control of &#946;1&#8208;AR activation by means of photoswitchable drugs with a high level of &#946;1&#8208;/&#946;2&#8208;AR selectivity. All reported molecules allow for an efficient real&#8208;time optical control of receptor function in vitro. Moreover, using confocal microscopy we demonstrate that the binding of our best hit, pAzo&#8208;2, can be reversibly photocontrolled. Strikingly, pAzo&#8208;2 also enables a dynamic cardiac rhythm management on living zebrafish larvae using light, thus highlighting the therapeutic and research potential of the developed photoswitches. Overall, this work provides the first proof of precise control of the therapeutic target &#946;1&#8208;AR in native environments using light.

         <title>Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4 via Pd&#948;+&#8208;Assisted Hydrodeoxygenation over CeO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal oxide nanosheets doped with positively charged Pd&#948;+ sites can act as the active sites of water activation to offer additional H* species, which could improve the probability of further protonation over the carbon&#8208;containing intermediates, thus promoting the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.







Abstract
Here, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets are designed to realize selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4. As a prototype, Pd&#8208;doped CeO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the active sites of Pd&#948;+ (2&lt;&#948;&lt;4) and Ce3+&#8722;Ov are revealed by quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Moreover, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra of D2O photodissociation and desorption verify the existence of the Pd&#8722;OD bond, implying that Pd&#948;+ sites can participate in water oxidation to deliver H* species for facilitating the protonation of the intermediates. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest the Pd doping could regulate the formation energy barrier of the key intermediates CO* and CH3O*, thus making CO2 reduction to CH4 become the favorable process. Accordingly, Pd&#8208;doped CeO2 nanosheets achieve nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity of CO2 photoreduction, with the raising CH4 evolution rate of 41.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Here, noble-metal-doped two-dimensional metal oxide nanosheets are designed to realize selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. As a prototype, Pd-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are fabricated, where the active sites of Pd&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (2&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;4) and Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; are revealed by quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectra and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Moreover, in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectra of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O photodissociation and desorption verify the existence of the Pd&#8722;OD bond, implying that Pd&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites can participate in water oxidation to deliver H* species for facilitating the protonation of the intermediates. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest the Pd doping could regulate the formation energy barrier of the key intermediates CO* and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O*, thus making CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; become the favorable process. Accordingly, Pd-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets achieve nearly 100&#8201;% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, with the raising CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 41.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryl Phosphorus Compounds by Chiral&#8208;Phosphonium&#8208;Salt&#8208;Enabled Cascade Arene Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective organocatalytic cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl phosphorus compounds. The approach involves multistep arene formation promoted by multifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis and proceeds through a complex Thorpe&#8208;type cycloaddition/oxidative hydroxylation/aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl monophosphorus molecules, exemplified by atropisomeric 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl aminophosphines, are significant motifs in numerous chiral ligands/catalysts. Developing efficient methods for preparing phosphorus compounds with these privileged motifs is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a chiral&#8208;phosphonium&#8208;salt&#8208;catalyzed novel cascade between phosphorus&#8208;containing nitroolefins and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins, leading to a great diversity of atropisomeric biaryls bearing phosphorus groups in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The reaction features include a Thorpe&#8208;type cycloaddition/oxidative hydroxylation/aromatization cascade pathway with a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer process. Insight gained from our studies is expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of atropisomeric biaryl phosphorus compounds, offering a platform for developing new efficient chiral ligands and catalysts.

         <title>Unbiased C3&#8208;Electrophilic Indoles: Triflic Acid Mediated C3&#8208;Regioselective Hydroarylation of N&#8722;H Indoles
</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct dearomative C3&#8208;functionalization of indoles provided access to privileged scaffolds by an umpolung strategy. Against all odds, C3&#8208;indolium intermediates could be generated from NH&#8208;indoles under operationally simple conditions with triflic acid at room temperature to promote intra&#8208; and intermolecular C3&#8208;regioselective hydroarylation. DFT studies suggest that these cationic or dicationic intermediates could be stabilized by H&#8208;bonded clusters.







Abstract
The direct dearomative addition of arenes to the C3 position of unprotected indoles is reported under operationally simple conditions, using triflic acid at room temperature. The present regioselective hydroarylation is a straightforward manner to generate an electrophilic indole at the C3 position from unbiased indoles in sharp contrast to previous strategies. This atom&#8208;economical method delivers biologically relevant 3&#8208;arylindolines and 3,3&#8208;spiroindolines in high yields and regioselectivities from both intra&#8208; and intermolecular processes. DFT computations suggest the stabilization of cationic or dicationic intermediates with H&#8208;bonded (TfOH)n clusters.

         <title>From Stable PH&#8208;Ylides to &#945;&#8208;Carbanionic Phosphines as Ligands for Zwitterionic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PH ylides such as H2C=PH3 are considerably higher in energy than their corresponding phosphines H3C&#8722;PH2. Using bis(sulfonyl)methyl substituents, the first PH ylides stable at ambient conditions could be isolated in solution and in the solid state. They are ideal precursors to carbanionic phosphines with exclusive phosphine reactivity and thus to highly electron&#8208;rich phosphines.







Abstract
Although ylides are commonly used reagents in organic synthesis, the parent methylphosphine MePH2 only exists in its phosphine form in the condensed phase. Its ylide tautomer H3P+&#8722;CH2&#8722; is considerably higher in energy. Here, we report on the formation of bis(sulfonyl)methyl&#8208;substituted phosphines of the type (RO2S)2C(H)&#8722;PR2, which form stable PH ylides under ambient conditions, amongst the first examples of an acyclic phosphine which only exists in its PH ylide form. Depending on the exact substitution pattern the phosphines form an equilibrium between the PH ylide and the phosphine form or exist as one of both extremes. These phosphines were found to be ideal starting systems for the facile formation of &#945;&#8208;carbanionic phosphines. The carbanion&#8208;functionalization leads to a switch from electron&#8208;poor to highly electron&#8208;rich phosphines with strong donor abilities and high basicities. Thus, the phosphines readily react with different electrophiles exclusively at the phosphorus atom and not at the carbanionic center. Furthermore, the anionic nature of the phosphines allows the formation of zwitterionic complexes as demonstrated by the isolation of a gold(I) complex with a cationic metal center. The cationic gold center allows for catalytic activity in the hydroamination of alkyne without requiring a further activation step.

         <title>Chemiluminescent Probes with Long&#8208;Lasting High Brightness for In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrabright activatable chemiluminescent probes were synthesized which were equipped with intramolecular hydrogen bonding to prolong their half&#8208;lives for in vivo imaging of neutrophils in peritonitis and psoriasis mouse models.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time optical imaging of immune cells can contribute to understanding their pathophysiological roles, which still remains challenging. Current sensitive chemiluminophores have issues of short half&#8208;lives and low brightness, limiting their ability for in vivo longitudinal monitoring of immunological processes. To tackle these issues, we report benzoazole&#8208;phenoxyl&#8208;dioxetane (BAPD)&#8208;based chemiluminophores with intramolecular hydrogen bonding for in vivo imaging of neutrophils. Compared with the classical counterpart, chemiluminescence half&#8208;lives and brightness of BAPDs in the aqueous solution are increased by &#8764; 33&#8208; and 8.2&#8208;fold, respectively. Based on the BAPD scaffold, a neutrophil elastase&#8208;responsive chemiluminescent probe is developed for real&#8208;time imaging of neutrophils in peritonitis and psoriasis mouse models. Our study provides an intramolecular hydrogen bonding molecular design for improving the performance of chemiluminophores in advanced imaging applications.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Debromination of 2,3&#8208;Bis(dibromomethyl)&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;Bis(bromomethyl)naphthalene: Dimerization or Polymerization?</title>

On&#8208;surface reactions of benzylic bromides on Au(111) towards dimerization or polymerization via selective dehalogenative C&#8722;C coupling have been investigated. The unambiguous formation of conjugated poly(o&#8208;naphthylene vinylene) and electronic structure after thermal induced dehydrogenation have been revealed.







Abstract
We describe the on&#8208;surface dehalogenative homocoupling of benzylic bromides, namely bis&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208; and bis&#8208;gem&#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene as a potential route to either hydrocarbon dimers or conjugated polymers on Au(111). While bis&#8208;gem&#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene affords different dimers with naphthocyclobutadiene as the key intermediate, bis&#8208;bromomethyl naphthalene furnishes a poly(o&#8208;naphthylene vinylidene) as a non&#8208;conjugated polymer which undergoes dehydrogenation toward its conjugated derivative poly(o&#8208;naphthylene vinylene) upon mild annealing. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and density functional theory calculations provides deep insights into the prevailing mechanisms.

         <title>Electrolyte Sieving Chemistry in Suppressing Gas Evolution of Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the lifespan and cycling stability of sodium&#8208;metal batteries, the low reactive anion&#8208;mediated solvation structure is well separated from cation&#8208;dominated dilute electrolytes with high gassing reactivity by introducing a zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion&#8208;mediated electrolyte significantly weakens the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the cation in solvation structures, which effectively suppresses the gas evolution between Na metal and ester electrolytes.







Abstract
The sodium (Na)&#8208;metal batteries hold great promise as a sustainable technology owing to the high element abundance and low cost. However, the generally used carbonate electrolytes remain highly reactive towards Na metal, leading to flammable gas evolution. Here, we propose an electrolyte sieving strategy to separate anion&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;pairs from dilute electrolytes by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;pair firstly weakens the electron&#8208;withdrawing property of the cation, which effectively suppresses the gassing. In addition, the sieved electrolyte promotes the formation of robust inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphases. Therefore, it contributes to stable Na plating/stripping in Na|Al half cells with Coulombic efficiency maintaining at 98.5&#8201;% and a long service life of 800&#8197;cycles in full cells. Moreover, the electrode stability is well preserved even under harsh conditions of high temperature and ester&#8208;based electrolytes with higher reactivity.

         <title>Creation of a Yeast Strain with Co&#8208;Translationally Acylated Nucleosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered yeast strain was created by replacing genomic histones with mutants using an optimized yeast genetic code expansion (GCE) system. It can survive with co&#8208;translationally modified nucleosomes at the H3K56 position, providing insight into the functional differences in lysine acylation states, which might otherwise be difficult to study. Phenotypic variation between lysine acetylation and crotonylation was observed in this strain.







Abstract
Structurally diverse acylations have been identified as post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on histone lysine residues, but their functions and regulations remain largely unknown. Interestingly, in nature, a lysine acylation analog, pyrrolysine, is introduced as a co&#8208;translational modification (CTM) through genetic encoding. To explore this alternative life form, we created a model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing site&#8208;specific lysine CTMs (acetyl&#8208;lysine, crotonyl&#8208;lysine, or another synthetic analog) at histone H3K56 using non&#8208;canonical amino acid mutagenesis to afford a chemically modified nucleosome in lieu of their own in vivo. We further demonstrated that acetylation of histone H3K56 partly tends to provide a more favorable chromatin environment for DNA repair in yeast compared to crotonylation and crosstalk with other PTMs differently. This study provides a potentially universal approach to decipher the consequences of different histone lysine PTMs in eukaryotes.

         <title>Isolation of an Elusive Phosphametallacyclobutadiene and Its Role in Reversible Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond Cleavage</title>

The elusive phosphametallacyclobutadiene intermediate is isolated and characterized. This intermediate reveals insights into rapid and reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/cleavage, enabling the cycling between a trianionic pincer and a tetraanionic pincer ligand at will.







Abstract
The reactivity of phosphaalkynes, the isolobal and isoelectronic congeners to alkynes, with metal alkylidyne complexes is explored in this work. Treating the tungsten alkylidyne [tBuOCO]W&#8801;CtBu(THF)2 (1) with phosphaalkyne (10) results in the formation of [O2C(tBuC=)W{&#951;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8722;P&#8801;C&#8722;Ad}(THF)] (13&#8208;tBuTHF) and [O2C(AdC=)W{&#951;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8722;P&#8801;C&#8722;tBu}(THF)] (13&#8208;AdTHF); derived from the formal reductive migratory insertion of the alkylidyne moiety into a W&#8722;Carene bond. Analogous to alkyne metathesis, a stable phosphametallacyclobutadiene complex [tBuOCO]W[&#954;2&#8208;C(tBu)PC(Ad)] (14) forms upon loss of THF from the coordination sphere of either 13&#8208;tBuTHF or 13&#8208;AdTHF. Remarkably, the C&#8722;C bonds reversibly form/cleave with the addition or removal of THF from the coordination sphere of the formal tungsten(VI) metal center, permitting unprecedented control over the transformation of a tetraanionic pincer to a trianionic pincer and back. Computational analysis offers thermodynamic and electronic reasoning for the reversible equilibrium between 13&#8208;tBu/AdTHF and 14.

         <title>Oxidation Potential Gap (&#916;Eox): The Hidden Parameter in Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>

Experimental and computational studies have revealed that the efficiency of intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reactions is governed by the SOMO&#8211;HOMO gap of the coupling partners, and that the reaction efficiency can be predicted by the oxidation potential gap (&#916;Eox). Furthermore, tuning of the &#916;Eox value by the addition of cleavable electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups enabled the electrochemical synthesis of phenanthridone skeletons.







Abstract
Oxidative biaryl coupling of aryls with different electronic features generally fails. However, this has not been systematically studied via theoretical analysis, and thus, the crucial factor governing coupling efficiency remains unclear. Herein, we propose that the &#8220;oxidation potential gap (&#916;Eox)&#8221; is a key parameter in predicting the efficiency of an intramolecular oxidative coupling reaction, with &#916;Eox defined as a difference in the oxidation potentials of the relevant aromatic rings. Our experimental and computational analyses revealed that the efficiency of an aromatic intramolecular coupling reaction correlates with the activation energy (&#916;E&#8800;) of C&#8722;C bond formation of the radical cation intermediates. Furthermore, &#916;E&#8800; correlates with &#916;Eox. Therefore, we demonstrate the tuning of &#916;Eox by attaching cleavable extra electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing groups, enabling the rational synthesis of a phenanthridone skeleton using aromatic rings with an electronic gap.

         <title>Highly Stable Metal&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymer for Low Flicker AC&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free nonconjugated long&#8208;persistent luminescent copolymer that exhibits excellent optical stability under high temperature and high humidity was designed and characterized. Long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) is clearly observed at 353&#8197;K and the copolymer can be excited by ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared irradiation. The high initial LPL intensity with an ultrafast filling time significantly reduces flicker in alternating current driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs) to 63.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescent materials are promising light&#8208;emitting materials for encryption, architectural decoration, organic solar cells, and biomedical applications. However, their unstable structures and thermal&#8208; and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free nonconjugated copolymer that possesses stable photoluminescence at both high temperature and humidity. The room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of this copolymer lasts for more than 15&#8197;s and can be recovered in high humidity conditions by heating to remove moisture. Copolymer LPL can be achieved with various excitation wavelengths, ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and the LPL color can be adjusted accordingly. The high initial LPL intensity and ultrafast filling time of the copolymer makes it suitable for low flicker alternating current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs).

An all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte is demonstrated to enable a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase conversion via controllable nucleophilic reactions to improve the performance of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The fluorinated ether as anti&#8208;solvent further minimizes polysulfides solubility, and simultaneously stabilizes the Na anode. The as&#8208;developed batteries achieved high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.







Abstract
Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology, owing to the merits of high energy density and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance has been severely hindered by the poor compatibility between the existing electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, containing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (MTFE) anti&#8208;solvent and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, can greatly enhance the reversibility and cyclability of RT Na&#8211;S batteries. A NaF&#8208; and Na3N&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase derived from FDMA and FEC enables a &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase&#8221; Na&#8211;S conversion, eliminating the shuttle of polysulfides. The MTFE not only reduces polysulfide dissolution, but also further stabilizes the Na anode via a tailored solvation structure. The as&#8208;developed RT Na&#8211;S batteries deliver a high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photoredox Catalysis Triggers Nitric Oxide Release for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis is used for the controlled release of nitric oxide signaling molecules under physiological conditions. This new NO&#8208;releasing platform shows excellent antimicrobial activity and kills bacteria by hyperpolarizing and permeabilizing bacterial membranes, which can not only eradicate pathogens but also accelerate the healing of MRSA&#8208;infected wounds.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a robust tool for chemical synthesis. However, it remains challenging to implement photoredox catalysis under physiological conditions due to the complex microenvironment and the quenching of photocatalyst by biologically relevant molecules such as oxygen. Here, we report that UV&#8208;absorbing N,N&#8242;&#8208;dinitroso&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine derivatives can be selectively activated by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 photocatalyst within micellar nanoparticles under visible light irradiation (e.g., 500&#8197;nm) through photoredox catalysis in aerated aqueous solutions to form quinonediimine (QDI) residues with concomitant release of NO. Notably, the formation of QDI derivatives can actively scavenge the reactive oxygen species generated by fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, thus avoiding oxygen quenching of the photocatalyst. Further, we exemplify that the oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis&#8208;mediated NO release can not only kill planktonic bacteria in vitro but also efficiently treat MRSA infections in vivo.

         <title>Double&#8208;Modification Oriented Design of a Deep&#8208;UV Birefringent Crystal Functionalized by [B12O16F4(OH)4] Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;modification strategy, that is, introducing two types of anions (F and OH), is used to increase the polarizability anisotropy and HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap simultaneously. This leads to the discovery a new metal&#8208;free (NH4)4[B12O16F4(OH)4] with the unprecedented [B12O16F4(OH)4] giant cluster as a potential deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. It shows the largest birefringence (of &#916;nexp.=0.12 at 546.1&#8197;nm) among all inorganic hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is of significance to current technologies, and to this end, the birefringent crystal has emerged as an invaluable material as it allows for effective light modulation. Herein, a double&#8208;modification strategy driven by F and OH anions that makes double effects towards the critical property enhancement of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals is proposed. This leads to a new hydroxyborate (NH4)4[B12O16F4(OH)4] with giant cluster as a deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal with large birefringence (&#916;nexp.=0.12@546.1&#8197;nm). This birefringence is a record among inorganic hydroxyborates with experimentally measured birefringence. Structural analysis shows that the near&#8208;plane arrangement of [B12O16F4(OH)4] cluster is responsible for the large optical anisotropy. Theoretical calculations indicate that its &#960;&#8208;conjugated [BO3] and [BO2OH] units are the main source of this large optical anisotropy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polarization modulation of deep-UV light is of significance to current technologies, and to this end, the birefringent crystal has emerged as an invaluable material as it allows for effective light modulation. Herein, a double-modification strategy driven by F and OH anions that makes double effects towards the critical property enhancement of deep-UV birefringent crystals is proposed. This leads to a new hydroxyborate (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] with giant cluster as a deep-UV birefringent crystal with large birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;exp.&lt;/sub&gt;=0.12@546.1&#8197;nm). This birefringence is a record among inorganic hydroxyborates with experimentally measured birefringence. Structural analysis shows that the near-plane arrangement of [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster is responsible for the large optical anisotropy. Theoretical calculations indicate that its &#960;-conjugated [BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH] units are the main source of this large optical anisotropy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impacts of Dissolved Ni2+ on the Solid Electrolyte Interphase on a Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy coupled with multivariate curve resolution analysis is used to investigate the impact and distribution of Ni species on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During accelerated aging of the LiNi0.88Co0.08Mn0.04O2/graphite full cell, the dissolution of Ni aggravates significantly upon cycling and a strong correlation between the dissolved&#8208;Ni and organic species in the SEI on graphite is found.







Abstract
Transition metal (e.g. Ni) ions dissolved from layered&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;rich cathodes can migrate to the anode side and accelerate the failure of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The investigations of the impact and distribution of Ni species on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode are crucial to understand the failure mechanism. Herein, we used time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF&#8208;SIMS) coupled with multivariate curve resolution (MCR) analysis to intuitively characterize the distribution of Ni species in the SEI. We find that the SEI on the graphite electrode using an EC&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits a multi&#8208;stratum structure. During accelerated aging of the LiNi0.88Co0.08Mn0.04O2/graphite full cell, the dissolution of Ni aggravates significantly upon cycling. A strong correlation between the dissolved&#8208;Ni and organic species in the SEI on graphite is illustrated. The ion&#8208;exchange reaction between Ni2+ and Li+ ions in the SEI is demonstrated to be the main reason for the increase of SEI resistivity.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: Hydrogen Bonding to Indolylphosphine Ligands to Provide Fluoride Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable platinum (poly)fluorido complexes activate alkynes. The released fluoride is stabilised in the outer coordination sphere by cooperating indolylphosphine ligands. The complexes were applied for the selective catalytic hydrofluorination of internal alkynes to provide (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes.







Abstract
The reaction of the Pt complexes cis&#8208;[Pt(CH3)2{R2P(Ind)}2] (Ind=2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolyl, R=Ph (1&#8201;a), 4&#8208;FC6H4 (1&#8201;b), 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (1&#8201;c)) with HF afforded the fluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F(HF)2)(CH3){R2P(Ind)}2] 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, which can be converted into trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(CH3){R2P(Ind)}2] (3&#8201;a&#8211;c) by treatment with CsF. Addition of 3&#8208;hexyne to 2&#8201;a&#8211;c gave alkyne complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(C,C&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;C2H5C&#8801;CC2H5)(CH3){R2P(Ind)}2{F(HF)2}] (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) at which a fluoride is stabilised as polyfluoride in the coordination sphere by hydrogen bonding to the indolyl&#8208;substituted phosphine ligands. Subsequent heating of a solution of 4&#8201;a in the presence of PVPHF led to fluoroalkene formation. Selective catalytic hydrofluorination of alkynes to yield (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes were developed. The ability of hydrogen bonding to polyfluoride favours the fluorination step as demonstrated by studies with complexes bearing no indolyl groups at the phosphine ligands.

An asymmetric oxidative cross&#8208;coupling strategy that combines the non&#8208;natural catalytic activity of lipase with organic electrosynthesis was developed. This unprecedented protocol demonstrates that hydrolase catalysis is compatible with electrosynthesis.







Abstract
We describe the enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of secondary amines with ketones by combining the non&#8208;natural catalytic activity of lipase with electrosynthesis. Various 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;carbonyl indoles with a stereogenic quaternary carbon center were synthesized from 2&#8208;substituted indoles in yields up to 78&#8201;% with good enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r. and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.). This unprecedented protocol demonstrated that hydrolase catalysis is compatible with electrosynthesis, and the reaction can be carried out in organic solvents with a broad substrate scope and good stereoselectivity. This work provides insights into enzymatic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of a Negatively Curved Nanocarbon Molecule with an Octagonal Omphalos via Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments Optimizations Supplemented by Machine Learning</title>

         <dc:description>
A 192&#960;&#8208;nanocarbon molecule was contorted by installation of an octagonal omphalos to form a 3&#8208;nm saddle. The omphalos was synthesized via dimerization with the aid of Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments optimizations supplemented by machine&#8208;learning predictions. The saddle was stacked in a dimer by matching contorted surfaces with a negative Gauss curvature.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule was synthesized, which revealed the existence of negative Gauss curvatures on a &gt;3&#8208;nm molecular structure possessing 192 &#960;&#8208;electrons. The synthesis was facilitated by a protocol developed with Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments optimizations and machine&#8208;learning predictions, and spectroscopy and crystallography were used to reveal the saddle&#8208;shaped structure of the molecule. Solution&#8208;phase analyses showed the presence of dimeric assembly, and crystallographic analyses revealed the stacked dimeric structures. The stacked crystal structure was scrutinized by various methods, including Gauss curvatures derived from the discrete surface theory of geometry, to reveal the important role of the molecular Gauss curvature in dimeric assembly.

         <title>Polymer Nanoparticles with Uniform Monomer Sequences for Sequence&#8208;Specific Peptide Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoparticles with uniform monomer sequences for target recognition were synthesized for the first time by polymerizing nanoparticles in the presence of sequence&#8208;precise oligomers. The oligomers cooperatively recognized the amino acid sequence of the target peptide and neutralized its toxicity. This is the first step towards achieving a &#8220;monoclonal plastic antibody&#8221;, a synthetic polymer with a uniform monomer sequence for target&#8208;specific neutralization.







Abstract
Synthetic polymer nanoparticles (NPs) that recognize and neutralize target biomacromolecules are of considerable interest as &#8220;plastic antibodies&#8221;, synthetic mimics of antibodies. However, monomer sequences in the synthetic NPs are heterogeneous. The heterogeneity limits the target specificity and safety of the NPs. Herein, we report the synthesis of NPs with uniform monomer sequences for recognition and neutralization of target peptides. A multifunctional oligomer with a precise monomer sequence that recognizes the target peptide was prepared via cycles of reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and flash chromatography. The oligomer or blend of oligomers was used as a chain transfer agent and introduced into poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) hydrogel NPs by radical polymerization. Evaluation of the interaction with the peptides revealed that multiple oligomers in NPs cooperatively recognized the sequence of the target peptide and neutralized its toxicity. Effect of sequence, combination, density and molecular weight distribution of precision oligomers on the affinity to the peptides was also investigated.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation for a Gradient Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interphase Enables High&#8208;Rate and Stable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient inorganic&#8208;rich interphase is constructed on Na surface in a high&#8208;concentration ether&#8208;based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether. It leads to a configuration of solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters for a reinforced inner solvation sheath. The derived interphase results in a reduced energy barrier for Na+ migration and fast interfacial kinetics, and hence excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising anode for rechargeable batteries, however, it is plagued by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Na dendrites. Herein, a robust anion&#8208;derived SEI is constructed on Na anode in a high&#8208;concentration 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether, which effectively restrains Na dendrite growth. The hydrofluoroether can tune the solvation configuration of the electrolyte from three&#8208;dimensional network aggregates to solvent&#8211;cation&#8211;anion clusters, enabling more anions to enter and reinforce the inner solvation sheath and their stepwise decomposition. The gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI leads to a reduced energy barrier of Na+ migration and enhanced interfacial kinetics. These render the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery with an excellent rate capability of 79.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 24&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 6000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. This highlights the modulation of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry for advanced batteries.

         <title>Enhancement of Plasmon&#8208;Induced Photoelectrocatalytic Water Oxidation over Au/TiO2 with Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low quantum efficiency is a bottleneck for the development of the surface plasmon resonance effect in solar energy conversion. The enhanced electroconductivity and surface catalytic ability of TiO2 after Li+ intercalation can help to achieve highly efficient hot electrons collection and hot holes usage in Au/Li0.2TiO2. Au/Li0.2TiO2&#8217;s quantum efficiency of plasmon&#8208;induced water oxidation is greatly increased to 2&#8201;% compared to 0.03&#8201;% for Au/TiO2.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;induced chemical reaction is an emerging field but its development faces huge challenges because of low quantum efficiency. Herein, we report that the solar energy conversion efficiency of Au/TiO2 in plasmon&#8208;induced water oxidation is greatly enhanced by intercalating Li+ into TiO2. An incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency as high as 2.0&#8201;%@520&#8197;nm is achieved by Au/Li0.2TiO2 in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation, realizing a 33&#8208;fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared with Au/TiO2. The superior photoelectrocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the enhanced electric conductivity and higher catalytic activity of Li0.2TiO2. Furthermore, the ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy suggests that lithium intercalation into TiO2 could change the dynamics of hot electron relaxation in Au nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that intercalation of alkaline ions into semiconductors can promote the charge separation efficiency of the plasmonic effect of Au/TiO2.

         <dc:description>
A robust redox&#8208;flow battery is developed using a zinc&#8211;ferrocene bipolar electrolyte. This bipolar zinc&#8211;ferrocene redox&#8208;flow battery outperforms all previously reported aqueous organic redox&#8208;flow batteries (AORFBs) in terms of demonstrated energy density, power density, cycles and duration, and cycling stability.







Abstract
Zinc metal represents a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;capacity anode material to develop energy&#8208;dense aqueous redox&#8208;flow batteries (RFB). However, the energy&#8208;storage applications of traditional inorganic Zn halide flow batteries are primarily plagued by the material challenges of traditional halide cathode electrolytes (e.g., bromine), including corrosion, toxicity, and severe crossover. Herein, we report a bipolar zinc&#8211;ferrocene salt compound, zinc 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;sulfonatopropyl)ferrocene, Zn[Fc(SPr)2] (1.80&#8197;M solubility or 48.2&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722; charge storage capacity)&#8212;a robust, energy&#8208;dense, bipolar redox&#8208;active electrolyte material for RFBs. Zn[Fc(SPr)2]&#8208;based redox&#8208;flow batteries operated at high current densities of up to 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and delivered an energy efficiency of up to 81.5&#8201;% and a power density of up to 270.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A Zn[Fc(SPr)2] flow battery demonstrated an energy density of 20.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 and displayed nearly 100&#8201;% capacity retention for 2000&#8197;cycles (1284&#8197;h or 53.5&#8197;days).

         <title>A Noncovalent Photoswitch for Photochemical Regulation of Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncovalent photoswitch for regulating enzyme activity was synthesized based on a polymeric inhibitor&#8208;encapsulation method. This method noncovalently anchors an azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the active site of the encapsulated enzyme, allowing reversible control of the enzymatic activity using light. This approach provides a promising strategy to regulate the activity of the enzymes without genetic mutation nor chemical modification of enzyme.







Abstract
Photochemical regulation provides a promising approach for controlling enzyme activity on demand owing to its high spatiotemporal resolution. However, reversible regulation of the enzyme activity by light usually requires genetic mutations and covalent modifications of the target enzymes, which may lead to irreversible changes in the enzyme structure and subsequent loss of the enzymatic activity. Herein, we have developed a novel strategy based on a polymeric inhibitor&#8208;encapsulated enzyme, which noncovalently anchors the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors to the enzyme active site, thereby achieving reversible control of the activity of native enzymes using light. As neither genetic mutation nor chemical modification of enzymes is required for this method, negligible loss of the enzymatic activity was observed for the encapsulated enzymes compared to their native counterparts. Thus, this approach has demonstrated a promising strategy for achieving reversible regulation of the activity of native enzymes.

         <title>An Unusual Oxidative Rearrangement Catalyzed by a Divergent Member of the 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Superfamily during Biosynthesis of Dehydrofosmidomycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DfmD is a highly divergent member of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase superfamily that catalyzes desaturation, rearrangement and demethylation of its substrate. In vitro biochemical studies and homology modeling suggest that these transformations occur via novel chemistry.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of the natural product dehydrofosmidomycin involves an unusual transformation in which 2&#8208;(trimethylamino)ethylphosphonate is rearranged, desaturated and demethylated by the enzyme DfmD, a divergent member of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase superfamily. Although other members of this enzyme family catalyze superficially similar transformations, the combination of all three reactions in a single enzyme has not previously been observed. By characterizing the products of in vitro reactions with labeled and unlabeled substrates, we show that DfmD performs this transformation in two steps, with the first involving desaturation of the substrate to form 2&#8208;(trimethylamino)vinylphosphonate, and the second involving rearrangement and demethylation to form methyldehydrofosmidomycin. These data reveal significant differences from the desaturation and rearrangement reactions catalyzed by other family members.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Epoxidation and Acidic Epoxide Opening of Antibacterial and Antiplasmodial Chlorotonils Yield Highly Potent Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogues of the natural product chlorotonil were obtained by semisynthesis through regio&#8208; and stereoselective epoxidation and subsequent ring opening. The derivatives retained activity against multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum and displayed increased solubility and stability without obvious resistance development. The depicted candidate showed beneficial pharmacokinetics and significant activity in an infection model in mice.







Abstract
The rise of antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to public health. The natural product chlorotonil was identified as a new antibiotic targeting multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens and Plasmodium falciparum. Although chlorotonil shows promising activities, the scaffold is highly lipophilic and displays potential biological instabilities. Therefore, we strived towards improving its pharmaceutical properties by semisynthesis. We demonstrated stereoselective epoxidation of chlorotonils and epoxide ring opening in moderate to good yields providing derivatives with significantly enhanced solubility. Furthermore, in vivo stability of the derivatives was improved while retaining their nanomolar activity against critical human pathogens (e.g. methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and P. falciparum). Intriguingly, we showed further superb activity for the frontrunner molecule in a mouse model of S. aureus infection.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Chain&#8208;Walking Hydroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with the assistance of a simple amide directing group is developed. A range of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines are conveniently synthesized via stabilization of 5 and 6&#8208;membered nickelacycles respectively.







Abstract
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydroalkylation of alkenyl amines with predictable and switchable regioselectivity is reported. By utilizing a ligand&#8208;controlled, directing group&#8208;assisted strategy, various alkyl units are site&#8208;selectively installed at inert sp3 C&#8722;H sites far away from the original C=C bonds. A range of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines are conveniently synthesized via stabilization of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered nickelacycles respectively. This method exhibits broad scope and high functional group tolerance, and can be applied to late&#8208;stage modification of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Photochemical Nitrile Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond UV&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy elucidates the molecular mechanism of the photo&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloelimination of N2 from a tetrazole. In liquid solution, the nitrile imine photoproduct is a very floppy molecule that can adopt a variety of different conformations ranging from propargylic all the way to allenic structures.







Abstract
The chemical reactivity of nitrile imines is of great utility in organic synthesis with applications rapidly expanding into the materials and life sciences. Yet, our understanding of the electronic and molecular structures of nitrile imines remains incomplete and the elementary mechanism of their photoinduced generation is entirely unknown. Here, femtosecond infrared spectroscopy after 266&#8197;nm&#8208;excitation of 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole has been carried out to temporally resolve the formation and structural relaxation dynamics of the nascent diphenylnitrile imine in liquid solution under ambient conditions. The infrared&#8208;spectroscopic evolution is interpreted by an initial sequence of intersystem crossings within 250&#8197;fs followed by the cleavage of N2 with formation of a structurally relaxed nitrile imine on the adiabatic ground&#8208;state singlet surface within a few tens of picoseconds. The infrared spectrum supports the notion of a &#8220;floppy&#8221; nitrile imine molecule whose equilibrium character ranges from fully propargylic to fully allenic in the room temperature liquid solution.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Impacts of Dissolved Ni2+ on the Solid Electrolyte Interphase on a Graphite Anode (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 30/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8211;lithium ion exchange reaction in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a graphite anode is investigated by Jun Lu, Khalil Amine, Xinping Qiu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202202894). The Li+ path is blocked due to the substitution of Li by Ni in the organic species, leading to the increase in the resistivity of the SEI.

         <dc:description>
A fluorescein&#8208;based imaging probe is turned on upon binding to the human &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid type&#8197;A (GABAA) receptor. In their Research Article (e202205198), Pedro&#8197;A. S&#225;nchez&#8208;Murcia, Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, and co&#8208;workers use multiscale calculations to show that the fluorescence is due to the rod&#8208;like conformation of the probe within the receptor. By contrast, the probe folds in solution and intramolecular &#960;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions quench the emission.

         <dc:description>
Supported metal nanoparticles (Pd, Rh, Ir, Ru, or Pt) catalyze the reductive conversion of diphenyl ether in water. There are three primary routes for this transformation, namely hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis, and hydrogenation. In their Communication (e202203172), Oliver&#8197;Y. Guti&#233;rrez, Johannes&#8197;A. Lercher, and co&#8208;workers highlight the primary products of the hydrogenolysis route (benzene and phenol), which is an important reaction for accessing cyclic compounds from renewable feedstocks.

         <dc:description>
Protein Modifications. In their Research Article (e202203684), Tobias&#8197;P. Dick et&#8197;al. show that persulfide adducts derived from commonly used alkylating agents are unstable under biologically relevant conditions. The adducts convert to thioethers by losing sulfane sulfur to nucleophilic acceptors.

Sylite, a short, dimerized peptide&#8208;based fluorescent probe, binds gephyrin, a hallmark protein of the inhibitory synapse. As reported by Christian&#8197;G. Specht, Hans&#8197;M. Maric et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202202078), Sylite visualizes inhibitory synapses both in neuron cultures and brain tissue and can be flexibly applied for widefield and confocal 3D volumetric synapse visualization, for brain tissue inhibitory circuits mapping and for super&#8208;resolution imaging of synapses. The cover picture shows a stylized image of a mouse hippocampus in coronal section stained with Sylite in green and DAPI nuclear stain in blue. Cover design by Christian G&#252;nther.

         <title>Pickering Emulsion Catalysis: Interfacial Chemistry, Catalyst Design, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pickering emulsions have emerged as an unconventional catalysis system operated under multiple/complex conditions, which are not possible in most cases for traditional catalysis technologies. This review highlights the mechanism, catalyst design, and the applications of the PIC that have expanded the limit of current catalysis technologies, and will shed a light on the bright future of Pickering emulsion catalysis.







Abstract
Pickering emulsions are particle&#8208;stabilized surfactant&#8208;free dispersions composed of two immiscible liquid phases, and emerge as attractive catalysis platform to surpass traditional technique barrier in some cases. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the development and the catalysis applications of Pickering emulsions since the pioneering work in 2010. The explicit mechanism for Pickering emulsions will be initially discussed and clarified. Then, summarization is given to the design strategy of amphiphilic emulsion catalysts in two categories of intrinsic and extrinsic amphiphilicity. The progress of the unconventional catalytic reactions in Pickering emulsion is further described, especially for the polarity/solubility difference&#8208;driven phase segregation, &#8220;smart&#8221; emulsion reaction system, continuous flow catalysis, and Pickering interfacial biocatalysis. Challenges and future trends for the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis are finally outlined.

         <title>Unlocking New Reactivities in Enzymes by Iminium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the different strategies used in the design and engineering of novel enzymes that accommodate iminium catalysis. The advantages and challenges of developing enzymes for this catalysis mode are discussed. Recent developments in iminium biocatalysis showcase the tremendous power of combining chemomimetic biocatalyst design and directed evolution to create useful biocatalysts for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformations.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysis in conquering challenging synthesis requires the constant input of new enzymes. Developing novel biocatalysts by absorbing catalysis modes from synthetic chemistry has yielded fruitful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes. Organocatalysis was originally bio&#8208;inspired and has become the third pillar of asymmetric catalysis. Transferring organocatalytic reactions back to enzyme platforms is a promising approach for biocatalyst creation. Herein, we summarize recent developments in the design of novel biocatalysts that adopt iminium catalysis, a fundamental branch in organocatalysis. By repurposing existing enzymes or constructing artificial enzymes, various biocatalysts for iminium catalysis have been created and optimized via protein engineering to promote valuable abiological transformations. Recent advances in iminium biocatalysis illustrate the power of combining chemomimetic biocatalyst design and directed evolution to generate useful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes.

         <title>Molecular Motion and Nonradiative Decay: Towards Efficient Photothermal and Photoacoustic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, the molecular motion&#8208;facilitated nonradiative decay (MMFND) effect has been widely used to develop efficient photothermal and photoacoustic systems. To give a timely summary of this emerging field, the present Minireview systematically highlights the underlying mechanism, molecular design principles, and advanced applications of photothermal transduction agents with flexible molecular groups.







Abstract
Nonradiative decay invariably competes with radiative decay during the deexcitation process of matter. In the community of luminescence research, nonradiative decay has been deemed less attractive than radiative decay. However, all things in their being are good for something and so is nonradiative decay. As the molecular motion&#8208;facilitated nonradiative decay (MMFND) effect is inevitable in photophysical processes, it provides a new avenue to convert the harvested light energy into exploitable forms by harnessing molecular motion. In many cases, active molecular motion enables thermal deactivation from excited states. In this Minireview, recent advances in photothermal and photoacoustic systems with MMFND character are summarized. We believe that this presentation of the rational engineering of molecular motion for efficient photothermal generation will deepen the understanding of the relationship between molecular motion and nonradiative decay and navigate people to rethink the positive aspects of nonradiative decay for the establishment of new light&#8208;controllable techniques.

         <title>A Biostable l&#8208;DNA Hydrogel with Improved Stability for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An l&#8208;DNA hydrogel is reported with the outstanding shear&#8208;thinning, self&#8208;healing and thermal&#8208;responsiveness properties of d&#8208;DNA hydrogels based on the same network topology and supramolecular interactions. Additionally, with the mirror&#8208;isomer deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited excellent biostability and stimulated low inflammation. These advances will greatly promote the feasibility of real&#8208;world applications.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels have attracted increasing attention owing to their excellent permeability and high mechanical strength, together with thixotropy, versatile programmability and good biocompatibility. However, the moderate biostability and immune stimulation of DNA have arisen as big concerns for future potential clinical applications. Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of a novel l&#8208;DNA hydrogel, which inherited the extraordinary physical properties of a d&#8208;DNA hydrogel. With the mirror&#8208;isomer deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited improved biostability, withstanding fetal bovine serum (FBS) for at least 1&#8197;month without evident decay of its mechanical properties. The low inflammatory response of the l&#8208;DNA hydrogel has been verified both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, this l&#8208;DNA hydrogel with outstanding biostability and biocompatibility can be anticipated to serve as an ideal 3D cell&#8208;culture matrix and implanted bio&#8208;scaffold for long&#8208;term biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-DNA hydrogel is reported with the outstanding shear-thinning, self-healing and thermal-responsiveness properties of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-DNA hydrogels based on the same network topology and supramolecular interactions. Additionally, with the mirror-isomer deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited excellent biostability and stimulated low inflammation.

         <title>Siliconoid Expansion by a Single Germanium Atom through Isolated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The expansion of the cluster core of a Si6 siliconoid by a single germanium atom is readily achieved by reaction of a monolithiated Si6 siliconoid with base&#8208;stabilized GeII chlorides. Depending on the stabilizing base (1,4&#8208;dioxane or an NHC), isolable intermediates of the expansion process towards the alleged Si6GeR6 global minimum are obtained and fully characterized (&#8226;=silicon).







Abstract
The growth of (semi&#8208;)metal clusters is pivotal for nucleation processes in gaseous and condensed phases. We now report the isolation of intermediates during the expansion of a stable unsaturated silicon cluster (siliconoid) by a single germanium atom through a sequence of substitution, rearrangement and reduction. The reaction of ligato&#8208;lithiated hexasilabenzpolarene LiSi6Tip5 (1Li&#8901;(thf)2, Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl) with GeCl2&#8901;NHC (NHC=1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) initially yields the product with exohedral germanium(II) functionality, which then inserts into an Si&#8722;Si bond of the Si6 scaffold. The concomitant transfer of the chloro functionality from germanium to an adjacent silicon preserves the electron&#8208;precise nature of the formed endohedral germylene. Full incorporation of the germanium heteroatom to the Si6Ge cluster core is finally achieved either by reduction under loss of the coordinating NHC or directly by reaction of 1Li&#8901;(thf)2 with GeCl2&#8901;1,4&#8208;dioxane.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones via Oxaziridinium Catalysed ortho&#8208;Hydroxylative Phenol Dearomatization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective, oxaziridinium&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;hydroxylative dearomatization&#8208;[4+2] dimerization reaction of phenols is described. This classically challenging transformation was successfully employed in the synthesis of bis(monoterpenoid) (+)&#8208;biscarvacrol and bacterial metabolite (&#8722;)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;xylenol), with high enantioselectivity. Our simple, organocatalytic system tolerates multiple phenol substitution patterns and ortho substituents.







Abstract
Hydroxylative dearomatization reactions of phenols (HPD) offer an efficient way to assemble complex, biologically relevant scaffolds. Despite this, enantioselective hydroxylative phenol dearomatizations for the construction of bicyclo[2.2.2]octenones are classically limited to stoichiometric chiral reagents, and a practical, enantioselective catalytic method has remained elusive. Herein, we describe a highly enantioselective, organocatalytic tandem o&#8208;HPD&#8208;[4+2] reaction. Our methodology utilizes a chiral oxaziridinium organocatalyst, that is available in both enantiomeric forms, to afford dearomatized products in high enantioselectivity over a range of phenol substitution patterns. This approach was applied to the highly enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;biscarvacrol (99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.) and (&#8722;)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;xylenol) (94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.). The practicality of our conditions was demonstrated at gram&#8208;scale, using an amine precatalyst, accessible in a single synthetic step.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Magnetic Mechanistic Study of Ni&#8208;Seamed Pyrogallol[4]arene Nanocapsules Reveal Presence of Novel Cylindrical and Spherical Species</title>

First solution&#8208;phase magnetic study of Ni&#8208;seamed pyrogallol4]arene leads to the discovery of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded 8&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius dimeric sphere, Ni&#8208;seamed 13&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius sphere and a Ni&#8208;seamed 11&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius tubular nanoassemblies.







Abstract
The magnetic properties of nickel&#8208;seamed C&#8208;pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC3Ni) hexamers and dimers are studied for the first time in solution. The combination of small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer measurements of the solution species reveal their paramagnetic and weakly antiferromagnetic behaviour. Surprisingly, the magnetic results indicated the presence of an unprecedented 13&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius species, larger than both the dimeric and hexameric nanocapsules with both octahedral and square&#8208;planar metal centers. To confirm the presence of this novel species, we performed a mechanistic study of PgC3Ni as a function of temperature and solvent and deduced the presence of two additional new species: a) an 11&#8197;&#197; cylinder with Ni atoms seaming the tubular framework and b) an 8&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius sphere with non&#8208;interacting Ni centers located within the internal cavity. Select parameters that shift the equilibrium towards desired species are also identified.

         <title>Controlling Reaction Routes in Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion of Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms of hydrogenolysis and hydrolysis of aryl ethers are common for the studied metals. The selectivity to hydrogenolysis increases as Pd&lt;Rh&lt;Ir&lt;Ru&#8776;Pt in decalin and water; the inverse trend is observed for hydrolysis in water. The hydrogenolysis selectivity correlates with the Gibbs free energy of H2 adsorption. The selectivity to C&#8722;O bond cleavage is maximized by increasing temperature and decreasing H2 pressure.







Abstract
Hydrogenolysis and hydrolysis of aryl ethers in the liquid phase are important reactions for accessing functionalized cyclic compounds from renewable feedstocks. On supported noble metals, hydrogenolysis is initiated by a hydrogen addition to the aromatic ring followed by C&#8722;O bond cleavage. In water, hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis proceed by partial hydrogenation of the aromatic ring prior to water or hydrogen insertion. The mechanisms are common for the studied metals, but the selectivity to hydrogenolysis increases in the order Pd&lt;Rh&lt;Ir&lt;Ru&#8776;Pt in decalin and water; the inverse was observed for the selectivity to hydrolysis in water. Hydrogenolysis selectivity correlates with the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption. Hydrogenolysis has the highest standard free energy of activation and a weak dependence on H2 pressure, thus, the selectivity to hydrogenolysis is maximized by increasing temperature and decreasing H2 pressure. Selectivity to C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaches &gt;95&#8201;% in water and alkaline conditions.

Hydrogenolysis has the highest standard free energy of activation and a weak dependence on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, thus, the selectivity to hydrogenolysis is maximized by increasing temperature and decreasing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure. Selectivity to C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaches &amp;gt;95&#8201;% in water and alkaline conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissecting Solvent Effects on Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perturbing effects of solvation obscure the energetics of H&#8208;bonding interactions. Experimental H&#8208;bond energies were determined in a wide range of competitive solvents using synthetic molecular balances. Dissection of the H&#8208;bond and solvation energetics using Hunter's solvation model enabled the direct comparison of experimental and gas&#8208;phase computational energies and the rationalization of competing secondary electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
The experimental isolation of H&#8208;bond energetics from the typically dominant influence of the solvent remains challenging. Here we use synthetic molecular balances to quantify amine/amide H&#8208;bonds in competitive solvents. Over 200 conformational free energy differences were determined using 24 H&#8208;bonding balances in 9 solvents spanning a wide polarity range. The correlations between experimental interaction energies and gas&#8208;phase computed energies exhibited wild solvent&#8208;dependent variation. However, excellent correlations were found between the same computed energies and the experimental data following empirical dissection of solvent effects using Hunter's &#945;/&#946; solvation model. In addition to facilitating the direct comparison of experimental and computational data, changes in the fitted donor and acceptor constants reveal the energetics of secondary local interactions such as competing H&#8208;bonds.

         <title>Constructing Organic Electroluminescent Material with Very High Color Purity and Efficiency Based on Polycyclization of the Multiple Resonance Parent Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecular construction paradigm based on polycyclization of the MR parent core has been proposed, and a representative MR&#8208;PAH based on para&#8208;alignment of boron and nitrogen atoms into a six&#8208;membered ring (p&#8208;BNR) has been constructed. The OLED employing the target model molecule BN&#8208;TP as an emitter exhibits ultrapure green emission with CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.70) and a maximum EQE of 35.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds have set off an upsurge of research because of their tremendous application prospects in the field of wide color gamut display. Herein, we propose a novel MR&#8208;TADF molecular construction paradigm based on polycyclization of the multiple resonance parent core, and construct a representative multiple resonance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (MR&#8208;PAH) based on the para&#8208;alignment of boron and nitrogen atoms into a six&#8208;membered ring (p&#8208;BNR). Through the retrosynthesis analysis, a concise synthesis strategy with wide applicability has been proposed, encompassing programmed sequential boron esterification, Suzuki coupling and Scholl oxidative coupling. The target model molecule BN&#8208;TP shows green fluorescence with an emission peak at 523&#8197;nm and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 34&#8197;nm. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing BN&#8208;TP as an emitter exhibits ultrapure green emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.1&#8201;%.

         <title>A Bioinspired Iron&#8208;Molybdenum &#956;&#8208;Nitrido Complex and Its Reactivity toward Ammonia Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a thiolate&#8208;bridged iron&#8208;molybdenum &#956;&#8208;nitrido complex allows the stepwise transformation of N3&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH3 in which all the key intermediates are isolated and well&#8208;characterized. It offers a unique perspective into the heterometallic cooperativity in the FeMo&#8208;cofactor.







Abstract
Multimetallic nitride species, especially those containing biologically related iron or molybdenum, are fundamentally important to understand the nitrogen reduction process catalysed by FeMo&#8208;nitrogenase. However, until now, there remains no report about the construction of structurally well&#8208;defined FeMo heteronuclear nitrido complex and its reactivity toward ammonia formation. Herein, a novel thiolate&#8208;bridged FeIIMoVI complex featuring a bent Fe&#8722;N&#8801;Mo fragment is synthesized and structurally characterized, which can be easily protonated to form a &#956;&#8208;imido complex. Subsequently, through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, this imido species can smoothly convert into the &#956;&#8208;amido complex, which can further undergo reductive protonation to afford the FeMo complex containing an ammine ligand. Overall, we present the first well&#8208;defined {Fe(&#956;&#8208;S)2Mo} platform that can give a panoramic picture for the late stage (N3&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH2&#8722;&#8594;NH3) of biological nitrogen reduction by the heterometallic cooperativity.

         <title>Structural Origin of Enhanced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Hybrid Manganese Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structural types of chiral hybrid manganese bromides both exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions. The coordinated type results in much higher dissymmetry factor (glum) due to the chirality of the inorganic framework induced by the distortion from coordination.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) and a superior photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) light sources. Here, we report eight new chiral hybrid manganese halides, crystallizing in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P212121 and showing intense CPL emissions. Oppositely&#8208;signed circular dichroism (CD) and CPL signals are detected according to the R&#8208; and S&#8208;configurations of the chiral alkanolammonium cations. Time&#8208;resolved PL spectra show long averaged decay lifetimes up to 1&#8197;ms for (R&#8208;3&#8208;quinuclidinol)MnBr3 (R&#8208;1). The glum of polycrystalline samples for coordinated structures (23&#215;10&#8722;3) is more than doubled compared with the non&#8208;coordinated ones (8.5&#215;10&#8722;3), due to the structural variations. R&#8208;1 exhibit both a high glum and a high PLQY (50.2&#8201;%). The effective chirality transfer mechanism through coordination bonds, with strongly emissive MnII centers, enables a new class of high&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>The Intrinsic Role of the Fusion Mode and Electron&#8208;Deficient Core in Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core have different effects in the A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A acceptors. The angular fusion is beneficial to enhance light absorption and reduce electron&#8208;vibration couplings to simultaneously accelerate exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport, while introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core will lead to deeper frontier orbitals, bathochromic absorption, and further promote exciton dissociation.







Abstract
The A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors with an angular fusion mode and electron&#8208;deficient core has significantly boosted organic photovoltaic efficiency. Here, the intrinsic role of the peculiar structure is revealed by comparing representative A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A acceptor Y6 with its A&#8208;D&#8208;A counterparts having different fusion modes. Owing to the more delocalized HOMO and deeper LUMO level, Y6 exhibits stronger and red&#8208;shifted absorption relative to the linear and angular fused A&#8208;D&#8208;A acceptors, respectively. Moreover, the change from linear to angular fusion substantially reduces the electron&#8208;vibration couplings, which is responsible for the faster exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and electron transport for Y6 than the linear fused A&#8208;D&#8208;A acceptor. Notably, the electron&#8208;vibration coupling for exciton dissociation is further decreased by introducing the electron&#8208;deficient core, thus contributing to the efficient charge generation under low driving forces in the Y6&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Nickel Glyoximate Based Metal&#8211;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enrich the diversity of metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), two novel nickel glyoximate based MCOFs have been developed. Notably, favourable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities were achieved thanks to the uniformly and densely distributed Ni glyoximate functional cores on the Ni&#8208;glyoximate&#8208;COF skeletons.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) have been recently received wide attention owing to the homogeneous distribution of active metal centers that are beneficial for enhancing the application potentials. However, metal complex based functional building blocks for MCOFs synthesis are limited. Herein, two new MCOFs (Ni&#8208;Py&#8208;COF and Ni&#8208;Bn&#8208;COF) were constructed via a novel nickel glyoximate based building block. Splendid photocatalytic activity on hydrogen evolution from water and great long&#8208;term recyclability were achieved using these nickel glyoximate based MCOFs as photocatalysts. Excitingly, even without the addition of Pt co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rates (HER) of Ni&#8208;Py&#8208;COF reached up to 626&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is better than many porous organic polymers. This work not only expands the type of building units for MCOFs, but also provides meaningful insights for developing stable, efficient and earth&#8208;abundant photocatalysts toward H2 generation.

         <title>Regioselective Fluoroalkylphosphorylation of Unactivated Alkenes by Radical&#8208;Mediated Alkoxyphosphine Rearrangement
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective radical fluoroalkylphosphorylation of unactivated alkenes is developed by a one&#8208;pot reaction of (bis)homoallylic alcohols, phosphine chlorides, and fluoroalkyl iodides under compact fluorescence light (CFL) irradiation. This protocol employs a novel radical rearrangement of alkoxyphosphine to achieve the unusual installing of a phosphoryl in the inner side of the terminal olefins by the dehydroxylative trifunctionalization of (bis)homoallylic alcohols.







Abstract
A novel distal radical rearrangement of alkoxyphosphine is developed for the first time and applied to the regioselective radical fluoroalkylphosphorylation of unactivated olefins. By employing a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction of (bis)homoallylic alcohols, organophosphine chlorides, and fluoroalkyl iodides under CFL (compact fluorescence light) irradiation, a series of fluoroalkylphosphorylated alkyl iodides and alcohols are easily synthesized by regiospecific installing a phosphonyl onto the inner carbon of terminal olefins and further iodination/hydroxylation. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration undergoes a distinctive radical cyclization/&#946;&#8208;scission on the lone electron pair of phosphorus, resulting in C&#8722;P bond formation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions from Aryl Halides

Diazaphospholene radical chemistry has been made catalytic with a combination of carbonates and phenylsilane as a terminal reductant. The system is suitable for generation of aryl radicals and intermolecular and intramolecular addition of these radicals.







Abstract
Diazaphospholenes are widely used as hydride transfer catalysts, however their use in radical reactions is a recently emerging area. Here, we show prior stoichiometric radical cyclizations of aryl iodides mediated by diazaphospholene hydrides are made catalytic by the combination of phenylsilane and alkali metal salts to regenerate the diazaphospholene hydride. The scope was expanded to include aryl bromides, which benefit from visible light irradiation. Twenty one substrates underwent cyclization, including a dearomative cyclization. Extension to six intermolecular radical hydroarylations with arenes, thiophenes, and a pyridine was also accomplished.

An enzymatic route to commercially important surfactants is presented. A truncated construct of carboxylic acid reductase (CARmm&#8208;A) catalyzes amide bond formation between fatty acids and amino alcohols with no esterification observed. The wide substrate scope of the enzyme, co&#8208;factor recycling, reaction engineering and up&#8208;scaling show the feasibility of this method for synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkanoyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylglucamides (MEGAs) are non&#8208;toxic surfactants widely used as commercial ingredients, but more sustainable syntheses towards these compounds are highly desirable. Here, we present a biocatalytic route towards MEGAs and analogues using a truncated carboxylic acid reductase construct tailored for amide bond formation (CARmm&#8208;A). CARmm&#8208;A is capable of selective amide bond formation without the competing esterification reaction observed in lipase catalysed reactions. A kinase was implemented to regenerate ATP from polyphosphate and by thorough reaction optimisation using design of experiments, the amine concentration needed for amidation was significantly reduced. The wide substrate scope of CARmm&#8208;A was exemplified by the synthesis of 24 commercially relevant amides, including selected examples on a preparative scale. This work establishes acyl&#8208;phosphate mediated chemistry as a highly selective strategy for biocatalytic amide bond formation in the presence of multiple competing alcohol functionalities.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Diamination of Arylcyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a short time, direct C(sp3)&#8722;H diamination of arylcyclobutanes catalyzed by rhodium(II) was successfully achieved in one step. Unlike the classical rhodium(II) nitrene reaction, this cascade reaction consists of nine elementary steps, in which the multiple consecutive oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossovers, desaturation, and nitrogen&#8208;radical addition are the major chemical transformations.







Abstract
Activated by multiple consecutive oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover and desaturation processes, the selective diamination of arylcyclobutanes, which is difficult to perform by classical metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion, was achieved in a short time by rhodium(II) catalysis using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant and nitrogen source.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Sequential Hydroboration/Isomerization/Hydroboration of 2&#8208;Aryl Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) were synthesized via an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydroboration/isomerization/hydroboration of vinylcyclopropanes through a trisubstituted alkene intermediate. These chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) were further converted into chiral 1,2,5&#8208;triaryl alkanes by an iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction with aryl halides.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric sequential hydroboration/isomerization/hydroboration of 2&#8208;aryl vinylcyclopropanes was for the first time reported for the preparation of valuable chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity via asymmetric sequential isomerization/hydroboration of a trisubstituted alkene intermediate. The reaction was carried out smoothly and this protocol was used for asymmetric syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;preclamol in gram&#8208;scale. The two primary C(sp3)&#8722;B bonds in chiral 1,5&#8208;bis(boronates) could be distinguished in iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, delivering chiral 1,2,5&#8208;triaryl alkanes with excellent enantioselectivity. Based on experimental and computational studies, a cobalt&#8208;hydride species was proposed as the active intermediate in hydroboration, isomerization, and second hydroboration reactions.

         <title>Chiral Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters Exhibiting Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with an EQE of 37.2&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of central chirality and multi&#8208;resonance framework derives a set of chiral enantiomers concurrently featuring narrowband emission and circularly polarized (CP) thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Owing to high rigidity and quasi&#8208;planarity of the skeleton, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%, a FWHM of 30&#8197;nm, as well as a high horizontal dipole orientation of 90&#8201;% are acquired in the doped film. Corresponding CP&#8208;OLEDs manifest a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency up to 37.2&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence.







Abstract
Highly efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters with narrowband emission remain a formidable challenge for circularly polarized OLEDs (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a promising strategy for developing chiral emitters concurrently featuring multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is demonstrated by the integration of molecular rigidity, central chirality and MR effect. A pair of chiral green emitters denoted as (R)&#8208;BN&#8208;MeIAc and (S)&#8208;BN&#8208;MeIAc is designed. Benefited by the rigid and quasi&#8208;planar MR&#8208;framework, the enantiomers not only display mirror&#8208;image CPL spectra, but also exhibit TADF properties with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%, a narrow FWHM of 30&#8197;nm, and a high horizontal dipole orientation of 90&#8201;% in the doped film. Consequently, the enantiomer&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 37.2&#8201;% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off, representing the highest device efficiency of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.

1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;H) are shown as efficient catalysts for reductive radical cyclization of aryl and alkyl halides under irradiation with visible light. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin.







Abstract
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;Hs) are highly nucleophilic organic hydrides serving as main&#8208;group catalysts for a range of attractive transformations. DAP hydrides can act as stoichiometric hydrogen atom transfer agents in radical reactions. Herein, we report a DAP&#8208;catalyzed reductive radical cyclization of a broad range of aryl and alkyl halides under mild conditions. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin, which rapidly regenerates DAP&#8208;H. The transformation is significantly accelerated by irradiation with visible light. Mechanistic investigations indicate that visible light irradiation leads to the formation of DAP dimers, which are in equilibrium with DAP radicals and accelerate the cyclization. The direct use of (DAP)2 enabled a catalytic protocol in the absence of light.

         <title>Bridging the Bays, Both Ways: A Janus Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Intense NIR&#8208;Emitting Terrylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>

Flying colours: Molecules with intense NIR emission are challenging to achieve. A strategy towards the development of new strongly NIR&#8208;emissive rylene diimides (RDIs) in quantum yields up to 90&#8201;%, having extended conjugation with restricted dynamics is reported. One of the molecules reported here, with conjugated carbazole wings, resembles a Janus butterfly.







Abstract
Molecules with intense near&#8208;IR (NIR) emission are beneficial for modern applications such as night vision, bio&#8208;imaging etc. However, elaborate synthetic manipulations make them demanding to accomplish. Herein, we present a simple yet exciting strategy to obtain novel Janus butterfly&#8208;shaped terrylene diimide derivatives with carbazole wings having absorption and intense emission in the NIR. Especially, unsymmetrically substituted terrylene diimides (TDIs) have been observed to have impressive emission quantum yields (up to 93&#8201;%), highest for this class of compounds. Minimal structural distortion as evidenced from structural characterization has been shown to correlate with these observations. Also, a novel two&#8208;tiered TDI&#8208;carbazole having an intense emission at 897&#8197;nm is also reported. Our strategy demonstrates that efficient near&#8208;IR luminophores can be achieved via precise functionalization.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Arene C(sp2)&#8722;H Amidations under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical approach towards 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;quinolinones by catalysis with FeBr3 has been developed. The solvent&#8208;free processes start from readily available dioxazolones, which undergo intramolecular amidation reactions providing the products in good to very high yields. Practically, the reactions are easy to perform, proceed within a short period of time and require only standard ball milling equipment.







Abstract
In a ball mill, FeBr3&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular amidations lead to 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;quinolinones in good to almost quantitative yields. The reactions do not require a solvent and are easy to perform. No additional ligand is needed for the iron catalyst. Both 4&#8208;substituted aryl and &#946;&#8208;substituted dioxazolones provide products with high selectivity. Mechanistically, an electrophilic spirocyclization followed by C&#8722;C migration explains the formation of rearranged products.

Electrochemical migratory cyclization of N&#8208;acylsulfonamides has been developed for the facile preparation of a diverse array of biologically interesting yet synthetically challenging benzoxathiazine dioxides.







Abstract
Benzoxathiazine dioxide, as a bioisostere of the clinically widely used diazoxide, exhibits interesting biological activity. However, limited success has been achieved in terms of its concise and direct synthesis. We report herein a facile electrochemical migratory cyclization of N&#8208;acylsulfonamides to access a diverse array of benzoxathiazine dioxides. The inclusion of electrochemistry is crucial for realizing such a novel transformation, which is substantiated both by the experiments and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations.

         <title>Anchoring Black Phosphorus Quantum Dots on Fe&#8208;Doped W18O49 Nanowires for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>

Anchoring black phosphorus quantum dots on Fe&#8208;doped W18O49 nanowires significantly promoted the photocatalytic performances for N2 fixation into NH3.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that the surface anchoring of black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) and bulk iron&#8208;doping in W18O49 nanowires significantly promotes the photocatalytic activity toward N2 fixation into NH3. More specifically, a NH3 production rate of up to 187.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 could be achieved, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of pristine W18O49 (18.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Comprehensive experiments and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that Fe&#8208;doping could enhance the reducing ability of photo&#8208;generated electrons by decreasing the work function and elevating the defect band (d&#8208;band) centers. Additionally, the surface BPQDs anchoring could facilitate the N2 adsorption/activation owing to the increased adsorption energy and advantaged W&#8722;P dimer bonding&#8208;mode. Therefore, synergizing the surface BPQD anchoring and bulk Fe&#8208;doping remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of W18O49 nanowires for NH3 production.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;crystal Diversity of Surface Barriers in Zeolites on Mass Transport by Using Super&#8208;Resolution Microimaging of Time&#8208;Resolved Guest Profiles</title>

         <dc:description>
Surface barriers of fluorescent probes in single ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites have been investigated by structured illumination microscopy. The results show inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crystal diversity in surface barriers within batches of zeolite crystals. This approach provides a new strategy for an in&#8208;depth understanding of mass transfer at the single&#8208;crystal scale.







Abstract
The applications of nanoporous crystalline materials are closely related to the mass transfer of guest molecules. However, the fundamental knowledge of mass transfer, and in particular the surface barriers controlled by the permeation of guest molecules through the external surfaces of materials, is still incomplete. The diversity of surface permeability at the single&#8208;crystal level, caused by the varying origins of surface transport resistance, hinders the rational materials design and needs better understanding. Herein, we probe the molecular transport in single zeolite crystals with fluorescent 4&#8208;(4&#8208;diethylaminostyryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (DAMPI) using super&#8208;resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). It showed that both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crystal diversity of surface barriers could be monitored by detecting the diffusion behaviors on the center and surface planes in single crystals. This adds a new perspective for studying the origins of the surface barriers as well as the molecular transport mechanisms in nanoporous materials.

         <title>Strong Circularly&#8208;Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from a Feasibly Separable Scaffold of Bidibenzo[b,d]furan with Locked Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasibly separable bidibenzofuran compound exhibits strong circularly&#8208;polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) when doping into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The silica&#8208;gel column can separate the absolute chiral R&#8208;isomer. The treated PVA films have a RTP efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%, a largest glum of 0.12, and a lifetime of 0.56&#8197;s. The impressive results indicate that the locked axial chirality skeleton endows the potential of achieving superior circularly&#8208;polarized emission for the small molecules.







Abstract
Novel accessible scaffold featuring circularly&#8208;polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is attractive but challenging. Herein, we report a new feasibly separable bidibenzo[b,d]furan compound with strong circularly&#8208;polarized RTP when doping into the rigid polymer matrix. The simple silica&#8208;gel column can separate the absolute chiral R&#8208;isomer with excellent chiroptical properties. The experimental data reveal that the treated films exhibit an RTP efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%, a largest dissymmetric factor of 0.12, and a longest lifetime of 0.56&#8197;s under ambient conditions. It is found that reducing the nonradiative decays boosts the intrinsic circularly&#8208;polarized RTP emission. The impressive results indicate that the locked axial chirality skeleton endows the potential of achieving superior circularly&#8208;polarized emission for the small organic optoelectronic molecules.

         <title>A Photoacoustic&#8208;Fluorescent Imaging Probe for Proteolytic Gingipains Expressed by Porphyromonas gingivalis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 30, July 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone bacteria in periodontal disease, and the gingipain proteases from P. gingivalis are a biomarker of infection. A small&#8208;molecule contrast agent that produces fluorescence and photoacoustic signals in the presence of gingipains is reported. This probe was used with animal models and was further validated with human samples of gingival crevicular fluid.







Abstract
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in periodontal disease. We herein report a dual&#8208;modal fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging probe for the detection of gingipain proteases secreted by P. gingivalis. Upon proteolytic cleavage by Arg&#8208;specific gingipain (RgpB), five&#8208;fold photoacoustic enhancement and &gt;100&#8208;fold fluorescence activation was measured with detection limits of 1.1&#8197;nM RgpB and 5.0E4&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 bacteria in vitro. RgpB activity was imaged in porcine jaws with low&#8208;nanomolar sensitivity. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated in gingival crevicular fluid samples from subjects with and without periodontal disease, wherein activation was correlated to qPCR&#8208;based detection of P. gingivalis (Pearson's r=0.71). Finally, photoacoustic imaging of RgpB&#8208;cleaved probe was achieved in murine brains ex vivo, with relevance and potential utility for disease models of general infection by P. gingivalis, motivated by the recent biological link between gingipain and Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Antineoplastic Enzyme as Drug Carrier with Activatable Catalytic Activity for Efficient Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) requires extra carriers, which suffers from early leakage and exposure of GOx. These issues will be of less concern if GOx itself acts as a drug carrier. However, the catalytic activity of GOx in the blood still needs to be inhibited. Herein, we found that GOx could self&#8208;assemble with hydrophobic molecules into uniform and stable nanoparticles (NPs), including sorafenib, 4&#8217;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. The catalytic activity of GOx in NPs was significantly inhibited due to the binding of small molecules with its hydrophobic pockets. After dissociation in the tumor acidic microenvironment, the enzyme activity of GOx could be largely recovered. This acidity&#8208;triggered &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; process ensured safe intravenous administration of GOx&#8208;based NPs. In vivo experiments showed that the combined starvation therapy and ferroptosis/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy effectively inhibited 4T1 breast tumor growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Nanostructured 3D Printed Materials by Controlling Macromolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates photopolymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) for 3D printed materials with nanostructures, which for the first time, are controlled by the structure of macromolecular chain transfer agent (MacroCTA). Importantly, phase&#8208;inverted morphologies featuring precisely defined domain spacings are obtained by using multi&#8208;arm macroCTA, which is not accessible with linear macroCTA.







Abstract
Nanostructured polymeric materials play important roles in many advanced applications, however, controlling the morphologies of polymeric thermosets remains a challenge. This work uses multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs to mediate polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) and prepare nanostructured materials via photoinduced 3D printing. The characteristic length scale of microphase&#8208;separated domains is determined by the macroCTA arm length, while nanoscale morphologies are controlled by the macroCTA architecture. Specifically, using 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; arm macroCTAs provides materials with different morphologies compared to analogous monofunctional linear macroCTAs at similar compositions. The mechanical properties of these nanostructured thermosets can also be tuned while maintaining the desired morphologies. Using multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs can thus broaden the scope of accessible nanostructures for extended applications, including the fabrication of actuators and potential drug delivery devices.

         <title>Upgrading Organic Compounds through Electrooxidation Coupled with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting is recognized to be the most sustainable and clean technology for hydrogen (H2)&#160;production. Unfortunately, the efficiency is seriously restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on the anode. In contrast to OER, electrooxidation of organics (EOO) is more thermodynamically and kinetically favourable. Thus, the integration of EOO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as it can largely improve the catalytic efficiency for H2&#160;production. Simultaneously, value&#8208;added organic compounds can be generated on the anode through electrooxidation upgrading. In this Minireview, we highlight the latest progresses and milestones in coupling EOO with HER. Emphasis is focused on the anode catalyst design, reaction mechanism understanding, and electrolyzer construction. Moreover, challenges and prospects are offered relating the future development of this emerging technology.</dc:description>

         <title>The Heaviest Bottleable Metallylone: Synthesis of a Monatomic, Zero&#8208;Valent Lead Complex (&#8216;Plumbylone&#8217;)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elusive plumbylone {[Si  II  (Xant)Si  II  ]Pb  0  }  3  stabilized by the bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand  1  , [Si  II  (Xant)Si  II  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  Si(Xant)Si(N  t  Bu)  2  CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[Si  II  (Xant)Si  II  ]Pb  0  Fe(CO)  4  }  4  are reported. The compounds  3  and  4  were obtained stepwise via reduction of the lead(II) dibromide complex {[Si  II  (Xant)Si  II  ]PbBr  2  }  2  , prepared from the bis(silylene)xanthene  1  and PbBr  2  , employing potassium naphthalenide and K  2  Fe(CO)  4  , respectively. While the genuine plumbylone  3  is rather labile even at &#8208;60&#176;C, its Pb  0  &#8594;Fe(CO)  4  complex  4  turned out to be relatively stable and bottleable. However, solutions of  4  decompose readily to elemental Pb and {[Si  II  (Xant)Si  II  ]Fe(CO)  3  }  5  at 80  o  C. Reaction of  4  with [Rh(CO)  2  Cl]  2  leads to the formation of the unusual dimeric [(OC)  2  RhPb(Cl)Fe(CO)  4  ] complex  6  with trimetallic Rh&#8208;Pb&#8208;Fe bonds. The molecular and electronic structures of  3  and  4  were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocompatible and Selective Generation of Bicyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclic peptides possess superior properties for drug discovery; however, their chemical synthesis is not straightforward and often neither biocompatible nor fully orthogonal to all canonical amino acids. The selective reaction between 1,2&#8208;aminothiols and 2,6&#8208;dicyanopyridine allows direct access to complex bicyclic&#160;peptides in high yield. The process can be fully automated using standard solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Bicyclization occurs in water at physiological pH within minutes and without the need for a catalyst. The use of various linkers allows tailored bicyclic peptides with qualities such as plasma stability, conformational preorganization, and high target affinity. We demonstrate this for a bicyclic inhibitor of the Zika virus protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 as well as for bicyclic versions of the &#945;&#8208;helical antimicrobial peptide aurein 1.2.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Dependent Properties of the Aqueous Electron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The temperature&#8208;dependent properties of the aqueous electron have been extensively studied using mixed quantum&#8208;classical simulations in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions based on one&#8208;electron pseudopotentials. While the cavity model appears to explain most of the physical properties of the aqueous electron, only a non&#8208;cavity model has so far been successful in accounting for the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum. Here, we present an accurate and efficient description of the aqueous electron under various thermodynamic conditions by combining hybrid functional&#8208;based molecular dynamics, machine learning techniques, and multiple time&#8208;step methods. Our advanced simulations accurately describe the temperature dependence of the absorption maximum in the presence of cavity formation. Specifically, our work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature, rather than from global density variations as previously suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids to &#945;&#8208;Amino Phosphonates by&#160;Decarboxylative Phosphorylation using Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino phosphonates exhibit potent inhibitory activity for a wide range of biological processes due to their specific structural and electronic properties, making them important in a plethora of applications, including as enzyme inhibitors, herbicides, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents. While the traditional synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates has relied on the multicomponent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction, we herein describe a novel and facile conversion of activated derivatives of &#945;&#8208;amino acids directly to their respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonate counterparts via a decarboxylative radical&#8211;polar crossover process enabled by the use of visible&#8208;light organophotocatalysis. The novel method shows broad applicability across a range of natural and synthetic amino acids, operates under mild conditions, and has been demonstrated to successfully achieve the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450Blt Enables Versatile Peptide Cyclisation to Generate Histidine and Tyrosine Containing Crosslinked Tripeptide Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report our investigation of the utility of peptide crosslinking cytochrome P450 enzymes from biarylitide biosynthesis to generate a range of cyclic tripeptides from simple synthons. The crosslinked tripeptides produced by this P450 include both tyrosine&#8208;histidine (A&#8208;N&#8208;B) and tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (A&#8208;O&#8208;B) crosslinked tripeptides, the latter a rare example of a phenolic crosslink to an indole moiety. Tripeptides are easily isolated following proteolytic digestion and can incorporate a wide range of amino acids in the residue inside the crosslinked tripeptide. Given the utility of peptide crosslinks in important natural products and the synthetic challenge that these can represent, P450 enzymes have the potential to play roles as important tools in the generation of high&#8208;value cyclic tripeptides for incorporation in synthesis, which can be yet further diversified using selective chemical techniques through specific handles contained within these tripeptides.</dc:description>

Interestingly, when cooling a hot monomer solution, the thermodynamically less stable J  1  is exclusively formed even at a particularly slowed temperature dropping rate, which transforms to the more stable J  2  at room temperature with very slow kinetics. This observation is ascribed to the differed nucleus sizes of J  1  and J  2  . During the cooling process, smaller J  1  nuclei are formed first at a higher temperature, favored by the entropy effect. At intermediate temperatures, the elongation of J  1  out&#8208;competes the nucleation of J  2  . Then, below the elongation temperature of J  2  , the formation of this thermodynamically stable aggregate is hindered kinetically, due to the depletion of monomer by the slow dissociation of J  1  . Additional evidence proving the larger nucleus size of J  2  is also identified with the varied&#8208;temperature spectral analyses and mathematic simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen spillover and its relation to hydrogenation: observations on structurally defined single&#8208;atom sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen spillover, involving the transfer of H atoms from metal sites onto the catalyst support, is ubiquitous in chemical processes such as catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogen storage. Atomic level information concerning the kinetics of this process, the structural evolution of catalysts during hydrogen spillover, as well as the nature of participation of the spilled over H in catalysis, remain vastly lacking. Here, we provide insights to those questions with a solubilized polyoxometalate&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalyst which allows for the use of characterization techniques generally inaccessible to the study of heterogeneous catalysis. Hydrogenation kinetics together with poisoning studies further reveal that hydrogen spillover can be either detrimental or beneficial for catalysis, the direction and magnitude of which depends mostly on the nature of the reducible functional group. Similar trends were observed on one of the most prototypical hydrogen spillover catalysts &#8211; Pt/WO  3  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dearomatization is achieved via asymmetric ligand&#8208;metal cooperation. A new and divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphines is developed to allow rapid access to several ligands, which in turn facilitate the application of this chemistry to a broad substrate scope including 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98% are achieved via selective acceleration of one enantiomer formation enabled by hydrogen bonding between substrate and ligand remote basic group.

         <title>Design of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Robust Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has become increasingly important in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, demanding superior and robust membranes. Herein, we report advanced OSN processes by designing three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes through moderated interfacial crystallization. Nanoporous supports work as the moderator allowing the crystallization of 3D COF membranes. The 3D COF features sub&#8208;nanometer and anti&#8208;swelling channels, affording a sharp selectivity to fine targets with an exceptionally high and stable methanol permeance. Thus&#8208;synthesized membrane exhibits a record stability against high&#8208;concentration feeds and long&#8208;term operation for ~1000 h. Moreover, we unambiguously demonstrate that our membrane holds excellent practicality in purifying active pharmaceutical ingredients from organic liquids. This work reveals the great potential of distinctive 3D COFs in producing prominent OSN membranes for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystallization Enabled Spatial Self&#8208;Confinement Gives Crystalline Porous Metal Oxide Nanosheets for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline metal oxide nanosheets show exceptional catalytic performance owing to the large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and quantum confinement effect. However, it is still a challenge to develop a facial and general method to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Herein, we report a cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Taking the synthesis of SnO2 as an example, the solvent evaporation from KCl and SnCl2 solution induces the cocrystallization of KCl and K2SnCl6, and the obtained composite with encapsulated K2SnCl6 can be in&#8208;situ converted into SnO2 nanosheets confined in KCl matrix, after water washing to remove KCl, porous SnO2 nanosheets can be obtained. Notably, a series of metal oxide nanosheets can be obtained through this general and efficient green route. In particular, porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets with improved surface O&#8208; species and abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit superior gas sensing performance to 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bismuth metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as heterogeneous catalysts are scarce, and there is little knowledge on the influence of the MOF features on their resulting activity and behavior. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity in the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Strecker reaction with ketones of three new MOFs prepared with the combination of indium or bismuth and 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;methanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid. One of them, denoted BiPF&#8208;7, is very robust and chemically stable, and demonstrates a high activity in the formation of the desired a &#8208;aminonitriles. The interaction of the catalytic substrates with the metal centers in this MOF has been crystallographically characterized, showcasing a concerted framework adaptability process that involves structural changes in framework components that are not directly involved in the binding of the guests .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Serological assay for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) patients including asymptomatic cases can inform disease progression and prognosis. A detection method taking into account multiplex, high sensitivity, and a wider detection range will help to identify and treat COVID&#8208;19. Here we integrated color&#8208;size dual&#8208;encoded beads and&#160;rolling circle amplification (RCA) into bead&#8208;based fluorescence immunoassay implemented in a size sorting chip to achieve high&#8208;throughput and sensitive detection. We used the assay for quantifying COVID&#8208;19 antibodies against spike S1, nucleocapsid, the receptor binding domain antigens, and detecting inflammatory biomarkers including interleukin&#8208;6, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, procalcitonin, C&#8208;reactive protein whose concentrations range from pg mL  &#8208;1  to &#956;g mL  &#8208;1  as different size beads integrating with RCA result in tunable detection range. The assay can be readily modified to simultaneously measure more COVID&#8208;19 serological molecules differing by orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Adaptive Chiral [1]Rotaxane for Thermo&#8208;Rulable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains a formidable challenge to realize thermo&#8208;rulable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we propose a new strategy by covalently potting the emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle as an adaptive chiral [1]rotaxane to address this issue. Different from its included analogue, the potted emitter [DS] showed adaptive conformers with tunable CPL in varied solvents. Significantly, upon controlled self&#8208;assembly, [DS] formed a channel&#8208;type nanoarchitecture ([DS]A), which exhibited an extraordinary thermo&#8208;rulable CPL between 25&#8208;100 &#176;C. Impressively, the glum was large as 0.024 at 25 &#176;C, which was amplified to 0.040 at 90 &#176;C with a decrease of QY (from 92% to 80%). By comparison, the assemblies of cage&#8208;type [DS]B and the unpotted emitter showed irreversible or unanswered thermal behaviors. The work demonstrated the thermo&#8208;rulable and durable CPL for the first time and provided an insightful understanding of thermal effect on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dihydroazulene&#8208;based Photofluorochromic AIE System for Rewritable 4D Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic patterns based on luminescent materials play an essential role in the digital age. However, it is still challenging to develop highly emissive photofluorochromic materials with dynamic behaviors to store information with multiple characteristics. Here, we report a series of dihydroazulene&#8208;based compounds which show typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. Moreover, the photo&#8208;switching ability of the dihydroazulene units, undergoing light&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening, enables photofluorochromic properties. The photofluorochromism also shows quantitively described responses to time and temperature via a reverse ring&#8208;closing process. Ultimately, a rewritable 4D information system, embedded with a quick response code, dot matrix with microstructures, color matrix of fluorescence, and time/temperature&#8208;dependent intensity change, is established with dynamic patterns. This work not only develops a dynamic AIE skeleton with photofluorochromic properties but also provides a new strategy for information encryption and cybernetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Highly Efficient High Salinity Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial solar vapor generation (SVG) is regarded as a promising and sustainable strategy for clean water production. While many materials have demonstrated excellent evaporation rates under one sun, it remains challenging to design solar evaporators without compromising SVG performance in high&#8208;salinity brines (&#8805; 10 wt%). Herein, polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) are proposed as a novel platform for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. Taking advantage of the unique anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, PZHs can trap salt ions from the brine water to form a more hydrated polymer network, leading to enhanced SVG performance. PZHs exhibit an exceptional solar evaporation rate of 4.14 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  in 10 wt% brine, which is ~20% higher than that in pure water. It is anticipated that salt&#8208;responsive PZHs may provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation solar desalination systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals Selective Interactions of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) with Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoelectrochemistry allows for the investigation of the interaction of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the elucidation of the binding behaviour of PFASs to nanoscale surfaces with high sensitivity. Mechanistic studies supported by single particle collision electrochemistry (SPCE), spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the capability of polyfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a representative PFAS, to selectively bind and induce aggregation of AgNPs. Single&#8208;particle measurements provide identification of the &#8220;discrete&#8221; AgNPs agglomeration (  e.g  . 2&#8208;3 NPs) formed through the inter&#8208;particles F&#8208;F interactions and the selective replacement of the citrate stabilizer by the sulfonate of the PFOS. Such interactions are characteristic only for long chain PFAS (&#8208;SO3  &#8208;  ) providing a means to selectively identify these substances down to ppt levels. Measuring and understanding the interactions of PFAS at nanoscale surfaces are crucial for designing ultrasensitive methods for detection and for modelling and predicting their interaction in the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Coordination Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Capacity Ammonium Storage in Amorphous Manganese Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonium (NH4+) ion as charge carrier is attracting attention in aqueous batteries. Yet, most NH4+ host materials are still limited by the relatively low capacities. Here, we fabricated a manganese phosphate (MP&#8208;20) for NH4+ ion storage. MP&#8208;20 displays a high capacity of 299.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 in ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte, outperforming other reported NH4+ host materials. Spectroscopy studies suggest a new NH4+/H+ co&#8208;insertion mechanism. We surprisingly discover that the NH4Ac electrolyte plays an important role in improving the charge storage capability of the materials. Experimental and computational results indicate acetate ions can form coordination bonds with the Mn atoms, tailoring the electronic structure of the Mn atoms and the surrounding O atoms, and therefore facilitating the NH4+ storage process. Our findings provide a new NH4+ host material and propose the important role of the electrolyte&#8208;electrode coordination effect in aqueous ammonium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Confinement of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Hydrates by a Capped Metallo&#8208;Cage under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in aqueous media often depend on their various hydration modes, which allow them to exist as monomeric or oligomeric species with different coordination numbers. Capturing rare&#8208;earth ions in a confined cavity can fix their hydration modes and thus enable their intrinsic properties to be distinguished. However, the isolation of ionic species from bulk aqueous media is not an easy task due to competitive interaction with bulk water. Here, we report the encapsulation of hydrated rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in a hydrophobic cavity of a synthetic cage. Cap&#8208;like counter anions located at the cage&#8217;s portals play an important role in capturing the rare&#8208;earth metals at a fixed position via electrostatic interactions. Preferential encapsulation of early lanthanoid (III) ions was observed even though all the rare&#8208;earth metals have the same hydration number and geometry, as visualized by the competitive inclusion of a dye molecule. Accordingly, the early lanthanoid ion was selectively extracted from a mixture of two rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>H2O2&#8208;Responsive NIR&#8208;II AIE Nanobomb for Carbon Monoxide Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT), which circumvents the limitations of conventional PTT (e.g., thermotolerance and adverse effects), is an emerging therapeutic strategy which shows great potential for future clinical applications. The expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can dramatically impair the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Thus, inhibition of HSPs repair and reducing the damage of nearby normal cells is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. Herein, we developed a nanobomb based on the self&#8208;assembly of NIRII AIE polymer PBPTV and carbon monoxide (CO) carrier polymer mPEG(CO). This smart nanobomb can be exploded in a tumor microenvironment in which hydrogen peroxide is overexpressed and release CO into cancer cells to significantly inhibit the expression of HSPs and hence improve the antitumor efficiency of the low&#8208;temperature PTT.</dc:description>

The expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can dramatically impair the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Thus, inhibition of HSPs repair and reducing the damage of nearby normal cells is crucial for improving the efficiency of low-temperature PTT. Herein, we developed a nanobomb based on the self-assembly of NIRII AIE polymer PBPTV and carbon monoxide (CO) carrier polymer mPEG(CO). This smart nanobomb can be exploded in a tumor microenvironment in which hydrogen peroxide is overexpressed and release CO into cancer cells to significantly inhibit the expression of HSPs and hence improve the antitumor efficiency of the low-temperature PTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of lipid research, bioorthogonal chemistry has made the study of lipid uptake and processing in living systems possible, whilst minimising biological properties arising from detectable pendant groups. To allow the study of unsaturated free fatty acids in live cells, we here report the use of sterculic acid, a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue, as a bioorthogonal probe. We show that this lipid can be readily taken up by dendritic cells without toxic side effects, and that it can subsequently be visualised using an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with quenched tetrazine&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. In addition, the lipid can be used to identify changes in protein oleoylation after immune cell activation. Finally, this reaction can be integrated into a multiplexed bioorthogonal reaction workflow by combining it with two sequential copper&#8208;catalysed Huisgen ligation reactions. This allows for the study of multiple biomolecules in the cell simultaneously by multimodal confocal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroaryloxy&#8208; and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric Reppe carbonylation reactions provide a straightforward access to  &#945;  &#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The reported paradigms predominantly adopted precious palladium as the catalyst. Here we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonylation of cyclopropenes with phenyl formate and CO/ROH, respectively. This asymmetrical synthetic protocol features high atom economy, good functional group tolerance, which rapidly constructs polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by facile conversion of the chiral products into bioactive molecules such as (&#8208;)&#8208;Tranylcypromine and (&#8208;)&#8208;Lemborexant.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture, storage, and release of Oxygen by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) &#8211; a review</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen is a critical gas for medical and industrial settings. Much of today&amp;#39;s global oxygen supply is via inefficient technologies such as cryogenic distillation, membranes or zeolites. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) promise a superior alternative for oxygen separation, as their fundamental chemistry can in principle be tailored for reversible and selective oxygen capture. We evaluate the characteristics for reversible and selective uptake of oxygen by MOFs, focussing on redox&#8208;active sites. Key characteristics for separation can also be seen in MOFs for oxygen storage roles. Engineering solutions to release adsorbed oxygen from the MOFs are discussed including Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and the highly efficient Magnetic Induction Swing Adsorption (MISA). We conclude with the applications and outlooks for oxygen capture, storage and release, and the likely impacts the next generation of MOFs will have on industry and the broader community.</dc:description>

         <title>Tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between Two Distinct Catalytic Sites Enables Fast and Selective Ring&#8208;opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations have emerged as a powerful approach towards the creation of sustainable polymers. Typical H&#8208;bonding catalysts for ring&#8208;opening are subject to a single catalytic site. Here  we describe a  H&#8208;bond&#8208;donor/Lewis&#8208;acidic&#8208;boron organocatalyst featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule. The ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of  epoxides with anhydride  mediated by these modular, and tunable catalysts  achieves  high selectivity (&gt; 99% polyester selectivity) and markedly higher activity  compared to either of the di&#8208;thiourea analogues or any combinations of them.  Calculations and experimental studies reveal that the superior catalytic performance arises from tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between two differentiated catalytic sites: thiourea pulls off the propagating chain&#8208;end from boron center,  simultaneously enhancing the role of monomer activation and also nucleophilicity of the propagation intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Over 70% Faradaic Efficiency for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Enabled by K Dopant&#8208;Tuned Cu Sites&#8208;Intermediates Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly desired yet challenging to strategically steer CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  ER) toward ethanol with high selectivity, to which the evolution of reaction intermediates on catalytically active sites holds the key. Herein, we report that K doping in Cu  2  Se nanosheets array on Cu foam serves as a versatile knob for tuning the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates in CO  2  ER, enabling highly selective production of ethanol. As revealed by characterization and simulation, the electron transfer from K to Se can stabilize Cu(I) species which facilitate the adsorption of linear *CO  L  and bridge *CO  B  intermediates to synergistically promote C&#8722;C coupling during CO  2  ER. As a result, the optimized K  11.2%  &#8208;Cu  2  Se nanosheets array can catalyze CO  2  ER to ethanol as a single liquid product with high selectivity in a potential area from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2 V. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 70.3% for ethanol production at &#8722;0.8 V with an extraordinary stability for 130 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Weakly&#8208;Solvated Electrolyte and Optimized Interphase Enables Graphite Anode Charge at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite anode suffers from great capacity loss and even fails to charge (  i.e.  Li  +  &#8208;intercalation) under low temperature, mainly arising from the large overpotential including sluggish de&#8208;solvation process and insufficient ions movement in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an electrolyte is developed by utilizing weakly solvated molecule ethyl trifluoroacetate and film&#8208;forming fluoroethylene carbonate to achieve smooth de&#8208;solvation and high ionic conductivity at low temperature. Evolution of SEI formed at different temperatures is further investigated to propose an effective room&#8208;temperature SEI formation strategy for low&#8208;temperature operations. The synergetic effect of tamed electrolyte and optimized SEI enables graphite with a reversible charge/discharge capacity of 183 mAh g  &#8208;1  at &#8208;30  o  C and fast&#8208;charge up to 6C&#8208;rate at room temperature. Moreover, graphite||LiFePO  4  full cell maintains a capacity retention of 78% at &#8208;30&#176;C, and 37% even at super&#8208;low temperature of &#8208;60&#176;C. This work offers a progressive insight towards fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The solid mixture &#8216;K  2  GeSb&#8217; was shown to comprise single&#8208;crystalline K  12  Ge  3.5  Sb  6  (  1  ), a double salt of K  5  [GeSb  3  ] with carbonate&#8208;like [GeSb  3  ]  5&#8211;  anions, and the metallic Zintl phase K  2  Ge  1.5  . Extraction of  1  with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine in the presence of crypt&#8208;222 afforded [K(crypt&#8208;222)]  +  salts of several novel binary Zintl anions: (Ge  2  Sb  2  )  2  &#8722;  (in  2  ), (Ge  4  Sb  12  )  4  &#8722;  (in  3  ), and in the presence of [AuMePPh  3  ] also (Ge  4  Sb  14  )  4  &#8722;  (in  4  ).

         <title>Achieving over 18&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cell Enabled by a ZnO&#8208;Based Hybrid Electron Transport Layer with an Operational Lifetime up to 5&#8197;Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) ZnO/NMA was developed, when combined with D18&#8201;:&#8201;N3, the highest power conversion efficiency (18.20&#8201;%) among inverted single&#8208;junction organic solar cells was achieved with an operational lifetime of 5&#8197;years. The hybrid ETL approach represents an important forward step for the commercial application of OSCs.







Abstract
Although organic solar cells (OSCs) have delivered an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19&#8201;%, most of them demonstrated rather limited stability. So far, there are hardly any effective and universal strategies to improve stability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs. Herein, we developed a hybrid electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) in inverted OSCs using ZnO and a new modifying agent (NMA), and significantly improved the stability and PCEs for all the tested devices. In particular, when applied in the D18&#8201;:&#8201;N3 system, its inverted OSC exhibits so far the highest PCE (18.20&#8201;%) among inverted single&#8208;junction OSCs, demonstrating an extrapolated T80 lifetime of 7572&#8197;h (equivalent to 5&#8197;years under outdoor exposure). This is the first report with T80 over 5000&#8197;h among OSCs with over 18&#8201;% PCE. Furthermore, a high PCE of 16.12&#8201;% can be realized even in a large&#8208;area device (1&#8197;cm2). This hybrid ETL strategy provides a strong stimulus for highly prospective commercialization of OSCs.

PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization of aliphatic amides is reported. This protocol features the use of practical and inexpensive oxidants and protecting groups, mild conditions, and reliable scalability. Further derivatization of &#946;&#8208;lactam products enables synthesis of a range of biologically important motifs such as &#946;&#8208;amino acid, &#947;&#8208;amino alcohol, and azetidine.







Abstract
The development of C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions that use common protecting groups and practical oxidants remains a significant challenge. Herein we report a monoprotected aminoethyl thioether (MPAThio) ligand&#8208;enabled &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization of tosyl&#8208;protected aliphatic amides using tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the sole oxidant. This protocol features exceedingly mild reaction conditions, reliable scalability, and the use of practical oxidants and protecting groups. Further derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;lactam products enables the synthesis of a range of biologically important motifs including &#946;&#8208;amino acids, &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols, and azetidines.

         <title>Modulating Ti t2g Orbital Occupancy in a Cu/TiO2 Composite for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 composite with excellent electronic structure of t2g orbital&#8208;occupied Ti was realized by adjusting the combination extent using a photo&#8208;deposition method. This electronic structure of t2g orbital&#8208;occupied Ti originating from the electronic synergistic effect of copper favors charge transport. The optimized Cu/TiO2 composite exhibits a productivity of 15.27&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high selectivity of 95.9&#8201;% for CO.







Abstract
The electronic structure of composites plays a critical role in photocatalytic conversion, whereas it is challenging to modulate the orbital for an efficient catalyst. Herein, we regulated the t2g orbital occupancy state of Ti to realize efficient CO2 conversion by adjusting the amount of photo&#8208;deposited Cu in the Cu/TiO2 composite. For the optimal sample, considerable electrons transfer from the Cu d orbital to the Ti t2g orbital, as proven by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The Raman spectra results also corroborate the electron enrichment on the Ti t2g orbital. Further theoretical calculations suggested that the orbital energy of the Ti 3d orbital in TiO2 is declined, contributing to accepting Cu 3d electrons. As a result, the Cu/TiO2 composite exhibited an extremely high selectivity of 95.9&#8201;% for CO, and the productivity was 15.27&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is almost 6&#8197;times that of the original TiO2. Our work provides a strategy for designing efficient photocatalysis as a function of orbital regulation.

         <title>Direct Oxygen Transfer from H2O to Cyclooctene over Electron&#8208;Rich RuO2 Nanocrystals for Epoxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron enrichment of metallic RuO2 nanocrystals can boost the highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene via direct oxygen transfer from sustainable water, which is the sole oxygen source under ambient conditions. An efficient hydrogen evolution reaction is also enabled on the counter cathode without sacrificing the high selectivity to epoxide on the working electrode.







Abstract
Production of more than 20&#8197;million tons of epoxides per year from olefins suffers from low atom economy due to the use of oxidants and complex catalysts with unsatisfactory selectivity, leading to huge environmental and economic costs. We present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of electron&#8208;rich RuO2 nanocrystals to boost the highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene via direct oxygen transfer from water as the sole oxygen source under mild conditions. The enhanced electron enrichment of RuO2 nanocrystals via the Schottky effect with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons largely promotes the capture and activation of cyclooctene to give a high turnover frequency (260&#8197;h&#8722;1) of cyclooctene oxide, far surpassing the reported values (&lt;20&#8197;h&#8722;1) of benchmarked catalysts at room temperature with oxidants. Our electron&#8208;rich RuO2 electrocatalysts enable efficient and durable hydrogen production (Faradaic efficiency &gt;90&#8201;%) on the cathode without impacting on the selectivity to epoxide (&gt;99&#8201;%) on the anode.

&lt;p&gt;Electron enrichment of metallic RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals can boost the highly selective epoxidation of cyclooctene via direct oxygen transfer from sustainable water, which is the sole oxygen source under ambient conditions. An efficient hydrogen evolution reaction is also enabled on the counter cathode without sacrificing the high selectivity to epoxide on the working electrode.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthetic route to nonsymmetrical thiophene&#8208;fused aromatic systems was inspired by the biodegradation of benzothiophene. Excellent fluorescence characteristics of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated benzo[b]naphtho[1,2&#8208;d]thiophene (BNT) sulfoxides were observed both in solution and in the solid state. Fluorescence variation with different Br&#248;nsted acids illustrates the high application potential of these compounds.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of some complex meroterpenoids led to the discovery of intricate cascades that feature spontaneous intramolecular carbonyl&#8208;ene reactions, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone rearrangements, and intramolecular aldol reactions. The combination of these transformations allowed divergent access to four distinct natural product scaffolds from a common intermediate, mimicking their proposed biosynthetic pathways.







Abstract
Structurally unique natural products pose biosynthetic puzzles whose solution can inspire new chemical reactions. Herein, we propose a unified biosynthetic pathway towards some complex meroterpenoids&#8212;the hyperireflexolides, biyoulactones, hybeanones and hypermonones. This hypothesis led to the discovery of uncatalyzed, intramolecular carbonyl&#8208;ene reactions that are spontaneous at room temperature. We also developed an anionic cascade reaction featuring an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone rearrangement and an intramolecular aldol reaction to access four distinct natural product scaffolds from a common intermediate.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Orientation of Magnetic Double Stacks for Patterned Anisotropic Hydrogels with Multiple Responses and Modulable Motions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;response anisotropic hydrogels are developed by using a rotating magnetic field to orient the magnetic double stacks (MDSs) with &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles sandwiched by two nanosheets. Patterned gels with sophisticated orientations of MDSs are fabricated by multi&#8208;step magnetic orientation and photolithographic polymerization, which exhibit programmed deformations and motions under synergetic actuations.







Abstract
Reported here is a multi&#8208;response anisotropic poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel developed by using a rotating magnetic field to align magnetic double stacks (MDSs) that are fixed by polymerization. The magneto&#8208;orientation of MDSs originates from the unique structure with &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles sandwiched by two silicate nanosheets. The resultant gels not only exhibit anisotropic optical and mechanical properties but also show anisotropic responses to temperature and light. Gels with complex ordered structures of MDSs are further devised by multi&#8208;step magnetic orientation and photolithographic polymerization. These gels show varied birefringence patterns with potentials as information materials, and can deform into specific configurations upon stimulations. Multi&#8208;gait motions are further realized in the patterned gel through dynamic deformation under spatiotemporal light and friction regulation by imposed magnetic force. The magneto&#8208;orientation assisted fabrication of hydrogels with anisotropic structures and additional functions should bring opportunities for gel materials in biomedical devices, soft actuators/robots, etc.

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Raman Optical Activity in an Organic Molecular Lemniscate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman optical activity (ROA) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have been detected, in a single Raman experiment, for enantiomers of a lemniscular cicloparaphenylene&#8208;based molecule stabilized by a bicarbazole unit. The balance between the rigidity of the chiral bicarbazole core and the torsional flexibility of the oligophenylene loops is able to stimulate magnetically allowed transitions detectable by conventional spectroscopic devices.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and Raman optical activity (ROA) were observed in a single spectroscopic experiment for a purely organic molecule, an event that had so far been limited to lanthanide&#8208;based complexes. The present observation was achieved for [16]cycloparaphenylene lemniscate, a double macrocycle constrained by a rigid 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole subunit, which introduces a chirality source and allows the molecule to be resolved into two configurationally stable enantiomers. Distortion of oligophenylene loops in this lemniscular structure produces a large magnetic transition dipole moment while maintaining the &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;induced enhancement of the Raman signal, causing the appearance of the CPL/ROA couple. A two&#8208;photon mechanism is proposed to explain the population of the lowest&#8208;energy excited electronic state prior to the simultaneous emission&#8208;scattering event.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Tuned Rotation of Pyrazolyl Rings in a 2D Iron(II) Complex towards Synergetic Magnetic and Dielectric Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) polymer [FeII(dpa)][(pzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2 (1) was designed. It showed the synergetic switching of magnetism and dielectricity with high responsivity owing to enhanced cooperativity of FeII ions and coupled rotational movements of polar pyrazolyl groups.







Abstract
Materials showing synergy of magnetic and dielectric transitions are promising candidates for future molecular devices. The challenge is how to realize synergy between spin and dielectric transitions with responses to external stimuli. Herein, we design a 2D spin crossover (SCO) complex, [FeII(dpa)][(pzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2 (1) (dpa=1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne and pzTp=tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate).

&lt;p&gt;A new spin-crossover (SCO) polymer [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(dpa)][(pzTp)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was designed. It showed the synergetic switching of magnetism and dielectricity with high responsivity owing to enhanced cooperativity of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions and coupled rotational movements of polar pyrazolyl groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials showing synergy of magnetic and dielectric transitions are promising candidates for future molecular devices. The challenge is how to realize synergy between spin and dielectric transitions with responses to external stimuli. Herein, we design a 2D spin crossover (SCO) complex, [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(dpa)][(pzTp)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) (dpa=1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethyne and pzTp=tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate). The local structural changes about the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion were propagated to the whole crystal through the rigid bridging ligands (dpa), leading to elastic interactions to realize the abrupt SCO and rotational movements of polar apical pyrazolyl rings in the [(pzTp)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units. Dielectric measurements confirmed a substantial dielectric change (&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;=2.3) upon the spin transition.

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon&#8208;Induced Post&#8208;Ionization to Boost Ion Yields in MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging
</title>

         <dc:description>
A new efficient post&#8208;ionization strategy for MALDI&#8208;MS imaging is presented: Simple RF&#8208;Kr lamps were pulsed and synchronized with a MALDI laser using custom&#8208;made electronics. Initial photoionization of dopant vapor in the fine&#8208;vacuum ion&#8208;funnel source yielded &gt;100&#215; signal boosts of numerous lipid classes from mammal tissue sections. Deuterated components indicated complex gas&#8208;phase ionization pathways generating fragment&#8208;less [M+H]+/[M&#8722;H]&#8722; species.







Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI&#8208;MSI) is a rapidly growing method in the life sciences. However, for many analyte classes, its sensitivity is limited due to poor ionization efficiencies. To mitigate this problem, we here introduce a novel post&#8208;ionization scheme based on single&#8208;photon induced chemical ionization using pulsed RF&#8208;Kr lamps. The fine&#8208;vacuum conditions of a dual ion&#8208;funnel ion source effectively thermalize the evolving MALDI plume and enable ample gas&#8208;phase reactions. Injected chemical dopants crucially support fragment&#8208;less ionization to [M+H]+/[M&#8722;H]&#8722; species. Based on this interplay, numerous glycerophospho&#8208;, sphingo&#8208;, and further lipids, registered from mammalian tissue sections, were boosted by up to three orders of magnitude, similar to results obtained with laser&#8208;based post&#8208;ionization (MALDI&#8208;2). Experiments with deuterated matrix and dopant, however, indicated complex chemical ionization pathways different from MALDI&#8208;2.

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Materials as Highly Efficient Host for White Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A New Molecular Design Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) host materials have been designed for blue and white phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The PHC&#8208;based blue PhOLEDs display external quantum efficiency (EQE) higher than 25&#8201;%. The PHC&#8208;based white PhOLEDs display an EQE of 27.7&#8201;%, which is a similar efficiency to the best reported devices with heteroatom&#8208;based hosts.







Abstract
To date, all efficient host materials reported for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) are constructed with heteroatoms, which have a crucial role in the device performance. However, it has been shown in recent years that the heteroatoms not only increase the design complexity but can also be involved in the instability of the PhOLED, which is nowadays the most important obstacle to overcome. Herein, we design pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHC) as very efficient hosts in high&#8208;performance white and blue PhOLEDs. With EQE of 27.7&#8201;%, the PHC&#8208;based white PhOLEDs display similar efficiency as the best reported with heteroatom&#8208;based hosts. Incorporated as a host in a blue PhOLED, which are still the weakest links of the technology, a very high EQE of 25.6&#8201;% is reached, surpassing, for the first time, the barrier of 25&#8201;% for a PHC and FIrpic blue emitter. This performance shows that the PHC strategy represents an effective alternative for the future development of the OLED industry.

         <title>Mediating CO2 Electroreduction Activity and Selectivity over Atomically Precise Copper Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of atomically precise Cu8 cluster isomers with two core structures (cube&#8208; and ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped) were investigated for highly active and selective CO2 reduction. A difference in catalytic performance was attributed to variable metal core arrangements hidden in Cu8 nanoclusters. The ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped cluster exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for formic acid generation (FEHCOOH) almost two times that of the cube&#8208;shaped cluster.







Abstract
Atomically precise copper clusters are highly desirable catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and provide an ideal platform for elaborating structure&#8211;activity relationships. However, systematic comparative studies of Cu cluster isomers for electrocatalytic CO2RR are lacking because they are challenging to synthesize. A group of structurally precise Cu8 cluster isomers with different core structures (cube&#8208; and ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped) were developed and investigated for highly active and selective CO2 reduction. Electrocatalytic measurements showed that the ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8 cluster exhibited a higher FEHCOOH (&#8776;92&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V and higher selectivity than the cube&#8208;shaped cluster. Theoretical investigations revealed different levels of competitiveness with the hydrogen evolution reaction on the respective core&#8208;shaped Cu8 clusters and decreased free energies for the adsorbed HCOO* intermediates on the ditetrahedron&#8208;shaped Cu8 clusters.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bis&#8208;NHC Ligand and Coinage Metal Ions: Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Driven Chemistry between the Tri&#8208; and Tetranuclear Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (bis&#8208;HNC) ligands and AgI ions has been shown to lead to the formation of tri&#8208; and tetranuclear AgI&#8722;NHC complexes that are in equilibrium in solution. Importantly, this process is exclusive for AgI ions: slow exchange from the tetra&#8208; to the trinuclear species is detected with the analogous AuI complexes, whereas no such phenomena is observed for the corresponding CuI complexes.







Abstract
The discrete multinuclear AgI&#8722;NHC complexes [Agn(1)n)](X)n; (n=3 or 4, X=BF4, PF6), synthesized from a bis&#8208;NHC ligand 1 and AgI ions via multiligand self&#8208;assembly, were observed to be in equilibrium between two forms (tri&#8208; and tetranuclear) in solution on the NMR timescale, which is unprecedented in CNHC&#8208;donor based chemistry. The existence of both the species was confirmed by various studies such as NMR (1H, VT, 2D&#8208;DOSY) and ESI&#8208;MS analysis along with concentration studies. Importantly, replacing AgI with other coinage metals (AuI and CuI) was found to alter the phenomenon entirely: a slow exchange from the tetra&#8208; to trinuclear species was noticed for the AuI complexes (4&#8201;a,&#8201;b), whereas no such process was detected in case of the CuI complexes (5&#8201;a,&#8201;b).

The existence of both the species was confirmed by various studies such as NMR (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, VT, 2D-DOSY) and ESI-MS analysis along with concentration studies. Importantly, replacing Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; with other coinage metals (Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;) was found to alter the phenomenon entirely: a slow exchange from the tetra- to trinuclear species was noticed for the Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;), whereas no such process was detected in case of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The binding of magnesium(II) to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate in an ionic liquid solution is directly observed using the short&#8208;lived spin&#8208;
 &#946;&#8208;emitter 31Mg as an implanted NMR probe. The results constitute an important advancement toward using 31Mg &#946;&#8208;NMR to monitor magnesium(II) (bio)chemistry in solution.







Abstract
The complexation of MgII with adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) is omnipresent in biochemical energy conversion, but is difficult to interrogate directly. Here we use the spin&#8208;
 &#946;&#8208;emitter 31Mg to study MgII&#8208;ATP complexation in 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM&#8208;Ac) solutions using &#946;&#8208;radiation&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance (&#946;&#8208;NMR). We demonstrate that (nuclear) spin&#8208;polarized 31Mg, following ion&#8208;implantation from an accelerator beamline into EMIM&#8208;Ac, binds to ATP within its radioactive lifetime before depolarizing. The evolution of the spectra with solute concentration indicates that the implanted 31Mg initially bind to the solvent acetate anions, whereafter they undergo dynamic exchange and form either a mono&#8208; (31Mg&#8208;ATP) or di&#8208;nuclear (31MgMg&#8208;ATP) complex. The chemical shift of 31Mg&#8208;ATP is observed up&#8208;field of 31MgMg&#8208;ATP, in accord with quantum chemical calculations. These observations constitute a crucial advance towards using &#946;&#8208;NMR to probe chemistry and biochemistry in solution.

         <title>Zeolite NPO&#8208;Type Azolate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle for obtaining zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with an underlying NPO built from three&#8208;membered rings (3&#8208;rings) is reported. Among the hundreds of unique ZIFs known, only a few have been discovered that are partially constructed from 3&#8208;ring motifs. These findings provide a significant addition to the limited library of ZIF design principles to access attractive structural features for realizing practical function.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered rings (3&#8208;rings) are an important structural motif in zeolite chemistry, but their formation remains serendipitous in reticular chemistry when designing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Herein, we report a design principle for constructing four new ZIFs, termed ZIF&#8208;1001 to &#8208;1004, from tetrahedral ZnII centers (T), benzotriazolate (bTZ), and different functionalized benzimidazolates (RbIM) that adopt a new zeolite NPO&#8208;type topology built from 3&#8208;rings. Two factors were critical for this discovery: i)&#8197;incorporating the bTZ linker within the structures formed 3&#8208;rings due to a &#8736;(T&#8722;bTZ&#8722;T) angle of 120&#8211;130&#176; reminiscent of the &#8736;(Ge&#8722;O&#8722;Ge) angle (130&#176;) observed in germanate zeolite&#8208;type structures having 3&#8208;rings; and ii)&#8197;RbIM guided the coordination chemistry of bTZ to bind preferentially in an imidazolate&#8208;type mode. This series&#8217; ability to selectively capture CO2 from high&#8208;humidity flue gas and trap ethane from tail gas during shale gas extraction was demonstrated.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Chemical Recycling of CO2&#8208;Based Alicyclic Polycarbonates via Catalytic Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic pyrolysis of various CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates in bulk recovers epoxide monomers quantitatively using a simple CrIII&#8208;Salen catalyst. It even proceeds very efficiently for chemical recycling of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) from a plastic waste mixture and thus provides a closed&#8208;loop approach towards a circular plastic economy in applications of CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to their constituent monomers is the foremost challenge in building a sustainable circular plastics economy. Here, we report a strategy for highly efficient depolymerization of various CO2&#8208;based alicyclic polycarbonates to epoxide monomers in solvent&#8208;free conditions by a simple CrIII&#8208;Salen complex mediated catalytic pyrolysis process. The chemical recycling of the widely studied poly(cyclohexene carbonate) exhibits excellent reactivity (TOF up to 3000&#8197;h&#8722;1, 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading) and high epoxide monomer selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigation reveals that the process proceeds in a sequential fashion via a trans&#8208;carbonate intermediate.

         <title>In situ Synthesis of Supramolecular Polymers: Finding the Right Conditions when Combining Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent synthesis steps is promising to construct synthetic supramolecular systems. Yet, the fundamental principles that guide such an approach are barely understood. Here, the reaction behavior of in situ formed supramolecular polymers is studied, in which covalent reactions are intertwined with a non&#8208;covalent reaction network leading to an unexpected phase&#8208;separation behavior that determines the system composition.







Abstract
The combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent synthesis is omnipresent in nature and potentially enables access to new materials. Yet, the fundamental principles that govern such a synthesis are barely understood. Here, we demonstrate how even simple reaction mixtures behave surprisingly complex when covalent reactions are coupled to self&#8208;assembly processes. Specifically, we study the reaction behavior of a system in which the in situ formation of discotic benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomers is linked to an intertwined non&#8208;covalent reaction network including self&#8208;assembly into helical BTA polymers. This system shows an unexpected phase&#8208;separation behavior in which an interplay of reactant/product concentrations, side&#8208;products and solvent purity determines the system composition. We envision that these insights can bring us one step closer to how to design the synthesis of systems in a combined covalent/non&#8208;covalent fashion.

         <dc:description>
In situ real&#8208;time imaging of the dynamic process of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dyes at the nanoscale was performed and their internal structures were inspected with minimum 2.8&#8197;nm localization accuracy through single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging. This revealed the heterogeneity and dynamics of the three different assemblies in situ.







Abstract
The visualization of self&#8208;assembled structure and dynamics at the molecular level has become a powerful method to understand structure&#8211;function relationships of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we in situ real&#8208;time imaged the dynamic process of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dyes at the nanoscale and inspected their internal structure with minimum 2.8&#8197;nm localization accuracy through single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging. We monitored the growth process of three different assemblies in situ, which possessed highly heterogeneous dynamics with different shapes and growth rates. Furthermore, diverse growth rates were also found at different sites in the same assembly. These results highlight the application of super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques for real&#8208;time visualization of internal assembled structure and dynamics in situ.

         <title>A Field&#8208;Independent Method for the Rapid Generation of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Clean Water Solutions for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Para&#8208;hydrogen, molecular synthesis, pulse sequence design and effective purification practices merge into a rapid method to hyperpolarize magnetic resonance probes, such as [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate, in neat water solutions in portable systems.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization methods in magnetic resonance enhance the signals by several orders of magnitude, opening new windows for real&#8208;time investigations of dynamic processes in vitro and in vivo. Here, we propose a field&#8208;independent para&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;based pulsed method to produce rapidly hyperpolarized 13C&#8208;labeled substrates. We demonstrate the method by polarizing the carboxylic carbon of the pyruvate moiety in a purposely designed precursor to 24&#8201;% at &#8776;22&#8197;mT. Following a fast purification procedure, we measure 8&#8201;% polarization on free [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate in clean water solutions at physiological conditions at 7&#8197;T. The enhanced signals allow real&#8208;time monitoring of the pyruvate&#8208;lactate conversion in cancer cells, demonstrating the potential of the method for biomedical applications in combination with existing or developing magnetic resonance technologies.

         <title>DNA Tile Self&#8208;Assembly Guided by Base Excision Repair Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of DNA polymeric tubular structures guided by the activity of two base excision repair (BER) enzymes: uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) is demonstrated. Orthogonal DNA tiles were designed that can be specifically activated by each enzyme and assembled into DNA co&#8208;polymers with highly predictable tile distribution.







Abstract
We demonstrate here the use of DNA repair enzymes to control the assembly of DNA&#8208;based structures. To do so, we employed uracil&#8208;DNA glycosylase (UDG) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), two enzymes involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We designed two responsive nucleic acid modules containing mutated bases (deoxyuridine or 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine recognized by UDG and Fpg, respectively) that, upon the enzyme repair activity, release a nucleic acid strand that induces the self&#8208;assembly of DNA tiles into tubular structures. The approach is programmable, specific and orthogonal and the two responsive modules can be used in the same solution without crosstalk. This allows to assemble structures formed by two different tiles in which the tile distribution can be accurately predicted as a function of the relative activity of each enzyme. Finally, we show that BER&#8208;enzyme inhibitors can also be used to control DNA&#8208;tile assembly in a specific and concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Dual Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Boron Shifts</title>

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters has been accomplished, which is selective for the most sterically hindered boronic ester. High regioselectivities were achieved through a facile radical 1,2&#8208;boron shift process, wherein the initially generated primary &#946;&#8208;boryl radical is rapidly converted to the thermodynamically more stable secondary radical before nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;deboronative cross&#8208;couplings of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters are valuable methods for the synthesis of functionalized organoboron compounds. However, such cross&#8208;couplings are limited to reaction of the sterically less hindered primary boronic ester. Herein, we report a nickel/photoredox&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;deboronative arylation of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters that is selective for coupling of the more sterically hindered secondary/tertiary position. This is achieved by taking advantage of a 1,2&#8208;boron shift of primary &#946;&#8208;boryl radicals to the thermodynamically favored secondary/tertiary radicals, which are subsequently intercepted by the nickel catalyst to enable arylation. The mild conditions are amenable to a broad range of aryl halides to give &#946;&#8208;aryl boronic ester products in good yields and with high regioselectivity. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to give trans&#8208;substituted products.

         <title>Revisiting the Dithenophthalimide Building Block: Improved Synthetic Method Yielding New High&#8208;Performance Polymer Donors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic process of dithienophthalimide (DPI) was simplified with a significant reduction of the synthetic cost by using chromium&#8208;mediated cyclization. Furthermore, two DPI&#8208;based nonhalogenated wide&#8208;band gap copolymers are synthesized. The binary organic solar cells based on pBDTT&#8208;DPI&#8208;Me&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 achieve a power conversion efficiency as high as 16.55&#8201;%. These results highlight DPI as an attractive A&#8208;unit for the development of new high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Imide&#8208;functionalized arenes have been one of the most promising acceptor (A) units in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, dithienophthalimide (DPI), a hybrid of thieno&#8208;[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (TPD) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units, has not been revisited since its first synthesis, likely owing to the high synthetic cost of the reported method. In this work, we simplified the synthetic procedure of the DPI skeleton with a significant reduction of the synthetic cost by using chromium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key chemistry. Using this method, two DPI&#8208;based nonhalogenated D&#8211;A copolymers are synthesized. The binary OSCs based on pBDTT&#8208;DPI&#8208;Me&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 achieves a power conversion efficiency as high as 16.55&#8201;%, highlighting DPI as an attractive A&#8208;unit for further exploration in OSCs.

         <title>An Ultramicroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Exhibiting High C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of C2H2/CO2  is not only industrially important for acetylene purification but also great scientific challenge due to their very similar molecular size and physical properties. To address this difficulty, herein, we present an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) from tetracyano bicarbazole to separate C2H2  from CO2  by taking advantage of differences in their electrostatic potential distribution. This material possesses a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C2H2  , thus showing extra strong affinity to C2H2  (46.73 kJ/mol) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2  /CO2  separation among the adsorbents reported. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the suitable pore environment in HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 provides multiple C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C with C  2  H  2  molecules. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its outstanding separation performance to C2H2  /CO2  mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibiotic&#8208;Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8216;Unclear&#8217; Infection Imaging?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent features of non&#8208;invasive molecular imaging, its progressive technology (real&#8208;time, whole&#8208;body imaging and quantification), and global impact by a growing infrastructure for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are encouraging prospects to investigate new concepts which could transform clinical care of complex infectious diseases. Researchers are aiming towards the extension beyond the routinely available radiopharmaceuticals and are looking for more effective tools that interact directly with causative pathogens. We reviewed and critically evaluated (challenges or pitfalls) antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging. We considered both radiotracer development for infection imaging and radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization. Overall, a total of 20 original PET radiotracers derived from eleven approved antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>(4+3) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Azadienes: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Azepanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azepanes are important seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, which are present in numerous natural and synthetic compounds. However, the development of convergent synthetic methods to access them remains challenging. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulative addition of aryl and amino donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. Densely substituted azepane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields and with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction occurred under mild conditions with ytterbium triflate as the catalyst. The use of copper triflate with a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand led to an enantioselective transformation. The obtained cycloadducts were convenient substrates for a series of further modifications, showing the synthetic utility of these compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating CO2 Hydrogenation over In2O3 Nanoparticles using Operando UV&#8208;vis and Impedance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In2O3 has emerged as a promising catalyst for CO2 activation, but a fundamental understanding of its mode of operation in CO2 hydrogenation is still missing, as the application of operando vibrational spectroscopy is challenging due to absorption effects. In this mechanistic study, we systematically address the redox processes related to the reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction (rWGSR) over In2O3 nanoparticles, both at the surface and in the bulk. Based on temperature&#8208;dependent operando UV&#8208;vis spectra and a novel operando impedance approach for thermal powder catalysts, we propose oxidation by CO2 as the rate&#8208;determining step for the rWGSR. The results are consistent with redox processes, whereby hydrogen&#8208;containing surface species are shown to exhibit a promoting effect. Our findings demonstrate that oxygen/hydrogen dynamics, in addition to surface processes, are important for the activity, which is expected to be of relevance not only for In2O3 but also for other reducible oxide catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling in Catalytic Hydrolysis and Alcoholysis of Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented quantum tunnelling effect has been observed in catalytic Si&#8211;H bond activations at room temperature. The cationic hydrido&#8208;silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex, {Ir[SiMe(o&#8208;C  6  H  4  SMe)  2  ](H)(PPh  3  )(THF)}[BAr  F  4  ], has proven to be a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and the alcoholysis of organosilanes. When triethylsilane was used as a substrate, the system revealed the largest kinetic isotopic effect (KIE  Si&#8211;H/Si&#8211;D  = 346 &#177; 4) ever reported for this type of reaction. This unexpectedly high KIE, measured at room temperature, together with the calculated Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (A  H  /A  D  = 0.0004) and difference in the observed activation energy [(Ea  D  &#8211;Ea  H  ) = 34.07 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  ] are consistent with the participation of quantum tunnelling in the catalytic process. DFT calculations have been used to unravel the reaction pathway and identify the rate&#8208;determining step. Finally, isotopic effects were considered by different methods, and tunnelling effects have been calculated to be crucial in the process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The catalytic generation of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM is reported. This desilylative approach grants access to &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates, which are typically difficult to access through traditional methods reliant upon deprotonation. The scope and limitations of this process is established in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition processes with perfluoroalkylketones (31 examples, up to 96% yield and &gt;99:1 er), as well as selective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with trifluoromethyl enones (4 examples, up to 75% yield and &gt;99:1 er). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate this process proceeds through an initial kinetic resolution of an  in situ  prepared (&#177;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted anhydride, while the reaction process exhibits overall pseudo zero&#8208;order kinetics.</dc:description>

Herein, a high&#8208;enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) was combined with a low&#8208;enantioselective styrene monooxygenase (SMO) for the cyclic deracemization of sulfoxides.

         <title>Suppressing Electron Back&#8208;Donation for a Highly CO&#8208;tolerant Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst via Cobalt Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst is commercially adopted in fuel cells but it undergoes formidable active&#8208;site poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO). In particular, given the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC), the issues of Pt poisoning and slow rate would combine mutually, notably worsening the device performances. Here we overcome these challenges through incorporating cobalt (Co) into molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy (MoNi  4  ), termed Co&#8208;MoNi  4  , which not only shows superior HOR activity over the Pt/C catalyst in alkali, but more intriguingly exhibits excellent CO tolerance with only small activity decay after 10,000 cycles in the presence of 500 parts per million (ppm) CO. When feeding with CO (250 ppm)/H  2  , the AEMFC assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394 mW cm  &#8208;2  , far exceeding the Pt/C catalyst. Experimental and computational studies reveal that weakened CO chemisorption originates from the electron&#8208;deficient Ni sites after Co incorporation that suppresses d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back&#8208;donation.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic N18 Macrocycles and a Polynitrogen Double Helix in Novel Yttrium Polynitrides YN6 and Y2N11 at 100&#8197;GPa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction between yttrium and molecular nitrogen at 100&#8197;GPa under laser heating at 3000&#8197;K yields two novel compounds, YN6 and Y2N11. Their crystal structures feature a unique organization of nitrogen atoms: an anionic N18 macrocycle and a polynitrogen double helix, respectively.







Abstract
Two novel yttrium nitrides, YN6 and Y2N11, were synthesized by direct reaction between yttrium and nitrogen at 100&#8197;GPa and 3000&#8197;K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. High&#8208;pressure synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that the crystal structures of YN6 and Y2N11 feature a unique organization of nitrogen atoms&#8212;a previously unknown anionic N18 macrocycle and a polynitrogen double helix, respectively. Density functional theory calculations, confirming the dynamical stability of the YN6 and Y2N11 compounds, show an anion&#8208;driven metallicity, explaining the unusual bond orders in the polynitrogen units. As the charge state of the polynitrogen double helix in Y2N11 is different from that previously found in Hf2N11 and because N18 macrocycles have never been predicted or observed, their discovery significantly extends the chemistry of polynitrides.

         <title>Crucial Roles of a Pendant Imidazole Ligand of a Cobalt Porphyrin Complex in the Stoichiometric and Catalytic Reduction of Dioxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt porphyrin complex with a pendant imidazole base ([(L1)CoII]) acts as a more efficient catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to a cobalt porphyrin without the pendant imidazole base ([(L2)CoII]).







Abstract
A cobalt porphyrin complex with a pendant imidazole base ([(L1)CoII]) is an efficient catalyst for the homogeneous catalytic two&#8208;electron reduction of dioxygen by 1,1&#8242;&#8208;dimethylferrocene (Me2Fc) in the presence of triflic acid (HOTf), as compared with a cobalt porphyrin complex without a pendant imidazole base ([(L2)CoII]). The pendant imidazole ligand plays a crucial role not only to provide an imidazolinium proton for proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2 in the presence of HOTf but also to facilitate electron transfer (ET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2 in the absence of HOTf. The kinetics analysis and the detection of intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic reduction of O2 have provided clues to clarify the crucial roles of the pendant imidazole ligand of [(L1)CoII] for the first time.

The kinetics analysis and the detection of intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic reduction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have provided clues to clarify the crucial roles of the pendant imidazole ligand of [(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;] for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the development of new Co complexes that have cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands and can catalyze highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration reactions of unsymmetrical internal alkynes. These reactions exhibited unusual regioselectivity: specifically, reactions of aryl alkyl internal alkynes showed excellent cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;addition selectivity, and reactions of dialkyl internal alkynes gave excellent cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;addition selectivity. Highly regioselective hydroboration of unsymmetrical dialkyl internal alkynes cannot be achieved by other known methods. The reactions described herein are highly synthetically useful, particularly for the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenylborates and alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a Co(I)&#8208;H species is a plausible active catalyst and the rigid structure of the cyclopropane skeleton of the ligands and the crowded reaction pocket were responsible for the unprecedented regioselectivity.</dc:description>
