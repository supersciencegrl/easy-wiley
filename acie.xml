         <title>Inlaying Bismuth Nanoparticles on Graphene Nanosheets by Chemical Bond for Ultralong&#8208;lifespan Aqueous Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) are rising as an important alternative to lithium ion batteries, owing to their safety and low cost. Metal anodes show a high theoretical capacity and nonselective hydrated ion insertion for ASIBs, yet their large volume expansion and sluggish reaction kinetics resulted in poor electrochemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrode cyclability enhancement mechanism by inlaying bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets through chemical bond, which is achieved by a unique laser induced compounding method. This anchored metal&#8208;graphene heterostructure can effectively mitigate volume variation, and accelerate the kinetic capability as the active Bi can be exposed to the electrolyte. Our method can achieve a reversible capacity of 122 mAh g&#8208;1 at a large current density of 4 A g&#8208;1 for over 9500 cycles. This finding offers a desirable structural design of other metal anodes for aqueous energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Evolution of Anatase&#8208;Supported Platinum Nanoclusters into a Platinum&#8208;&#8208;Titanium Intermetallic Containing Platinum Single Atoms for Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interactions characteristic of the encapsulation of metal particles by oxide overlayers have been widely observed on large metal nanoparticles, but scarcely occur on small nanoclusters (&#706;2 nm) for which the metal&#8208;support interactions remain elusive. Herein, we study the structural evolution of Pt nanoclusters (1.5 nm) supported on anatase TiO2 upon high&#8208;temperature H2 reduction. The Pt nanoclusters start to partially evolve into a CsCl&#8208;type PtTi intermetallic compound when the reduction temperature reaches 400 &#8451;. Upon 700 &#176;C reduction, the PtTi nanoparticles are exclusively formed and grow epitaxially&#160;along the TiO2 (101) crystal faces. The thermodynamics of the formation of PtTi via migration of reduced Ti atoms into Pt cluster is unraveled by theoretical calculations. The thermally stable PtTi intermetallic compound, with single&#8208;atom Pt isolated by Ti, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and promoted catalytic durability for CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Charged Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with High Volume Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) are emerging building blocks for functional materials, and their scalable fabrication is highly desirable. Current synthetic methods suffer from low volume yields resulting from confined on&#8208;surface/at&#8208;interface growth space and complex multiple&#8208;phase synthesis systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of charged COF&#8208;NSs in open space using a single&#8208;phase organic solution system, achieving magnitudes higher volume yields of up to 18.7 mg mL  &#8208;1  . Charge&#8208;induced electrostatic repulsion forces enable in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from initial discrete and disordered polymers into large and crystalline COF&#8208;NSs. The charged COF&#8208;NS colloidal suspensions are cast into thin and compact proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with lamellar morphology and oriented crystallinity, displaying outstanding proton conductivity, negligible dimensional swelling, and good H  2  /O  2  fuel cell performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoredox Catalysis Enables a Sustainable and Versatile Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable synthesis of macromolecules with control over sequence and molar mass remains a challenge in polymer chemistry. By coupling mechanochemistry and electron&#8208;transfer processes (i.e., mechanoredox catalysis), an energy&#8208;conscious controlled radical polymerization methodology is realized. This work explores an efficient mechanoredox reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization process using mechanical stimuli by implementing piezoelectric barium titanate and a diaryliodonium initiator with minimal solvent usage. This mechanoredox RAFT process demonstrates exquisite control over poly(meth)acrylate dispersity and chain length while also showcasing an alternative to the solution&#8208;state synthesis of semifluorinated polymers that typically utilize exotic solvents and/or reagents. This chemistry will find utility in the sustainable development of materials across the energy, biomedical, and engineering communities.</dc:description>

         <title>Off&#8208;center Mechanophore Activation in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Block copolymers (BCPs) are used in numerous applications in modern materials science. Yet, like homopolymers, BCPs can undergo covalent bond scission when mechanically stressed (mechanochemistry), which could lead to unexpected consequences in such applications. BCPs' heterogeneity may affect force transduction, perhaps changing force distribution and localization. To verify this, a gem&#8208;dichlorocyclopropane (gDCC) embedded linear chain is prepared and extended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) block. When stressed in solution, the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening of gDCC is accelerated compared to homopolymers, even though the mechanophores are at the chain ends. Moreover, a higher mechanophore activation selectivity is obtained. These results indicate that mechanochemical response outside, and even far from the chain center is quite prominent in BCPs, and that forces along the polymer chain can efficiently activate multi&#8208;mechanophores regions, even when far from the polymer midchain.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Conventional Polyureas into Dynamic Covalent Poly(aminoketoenamide)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical upcycling of polymers is an emerging strategy to transform post&#8208;consumer waste into higher&#8208;value chemicals and materials. However, on account of the high stability of the chemical bonds that constitute their main chains, the chemical modification of many polymers proves to be difficult. Here, we report a versatile approach for the upcycling of linear and cross&#8208;linked polyureas, which are widely used because of their high chemical stability. The treatment of&#160; these polymers or their composites with acetylacetone affords di&#8208;vinylogous amide&#8208;terminated compounds in good yield. These products can be reacted with aromatic isocyanates, and the resulting aminoketoenamide bonds are highly dynamic at elevated temperatures. We show here that this conversion scheme can be exploited for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(amino&#173;keto&#173;en&#173;amide) networks, which are healable and reprocessable through thermal treatment without any catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Synthesis of Pyridyl Ethers by BiV&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Arylation of Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that sterically&#8208; and electronically&#8208;diverse pyridyl ethers can be accessed via BiV&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O coupling of 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids. Use of a bismacyclic reagent not only confers modularity on our methodology, but also results in highly regioselective O&#8208;arylation that is unprecedented for BiV.







Abstract
We report that O&#8208;selective arylation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids is affected by a modular, bismacycle&#8208;based system. The utility of this umpolung approach to pyridyl ethers, which is complementary to conventional methods based on SNAr or cross&#8208;coupling, is demonstrated through the concise synthesis of Ki6783 and picolinafen, and the formal synthesis of cabozantib and golvatinib. Computational investigations reveal that arylation proceeds in a concerted fashion via a 5&#8208;membered transition state. The kinetically&#8208;controlled regioselectivity for O&#8208;arylation&#8212;which is reversed relative to previous BiV&#8208;mediated pyridone arylations&#8212;is attributed primarily to the geometric constraints imposed by the bismacyclic scaffold.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral XB [2]rotaxanes containing remarkably potent XB axle components including a novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif are constructed via a discrete chloride anion template directed synthesis. Quantitative 1H NMR halide anion titration studies in competitive aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures reveal the XB [2]rotaxanes display pronounced anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion recognition selectivity for chloride over iodide.







Abstract
Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8722;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.

         <dc:description>
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy. Its high molecular planarity originated from &#960;&#8208;conjugated PPPA chains results in ultrafast Zn2+ ion diffusion kinetics. Such a planar configuration with reducing energy gap also effectively accelerates intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process.







Abstract
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy as promising cathode material in organic zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), FTIR and XPS characterizations verify a reversible Zn2+&#8208;coordination mechanism in our PPPA cathode. Intriguingly, an ultrahigh Zn2+ diffusion coefficient of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 was found in this large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which is the highest one among all organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations reveal the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in our PPPA sample results in a significant reduction on energy gap, effectively accelerating intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process. Our finding provides insights to achieve high zinc&#8208;ion transport kinetics by a design strategy on planar polymer system.

         <title>Increasing the Distance of Adjacent Palladium Atoms for Configuration Matching in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance of adjacent Pd atoms is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated to be significant for defining the reaction pathways for selective hydrogenation processes exemplified by acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation here. Increasing the distance favors the formation of ethylene while restrains those of byproducts due to the simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and destabilized transition state of C2H3* coupling.







Abstract
Precisely tailoring the distance between adjacent metal sites to match adsorption configurations of key species for the targeted reaction pathway is a great challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on the atomically sites&#8208;tailored pathway in Pd&#8208;catalyzed acetylene hydrogenation, i.e., increasing the distance of adjacent Pd atoms (dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd) for configuration matching in acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against coupling. dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd is identified as a structural descriptor for describing the competitiveness for reaction pathways, and the increased dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd prefers the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway due to simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and the destabilized transition state of the C2H3* coupling. Spectroscopic, kinetics and electronic structure studies reveal that increasing dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd to 3.31&#8197;&#197; delivers superior selectivity and stability due to energy matching and appropriate hybridization of Pd 4d with In 2s and, especially, 2p orbitals.

         <title>Photochemical Mechanisms of Fluorophores Employed in Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single molecule localization microscopy has revolutionized our ability to investigate cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. This Review discusses the photochemical mechanisms harnessed to develop small&#8208;molecule probes that exhibit photoswitching properties necessary for application in imaging methods based on single&#8208;molecule localization. Strategies to develop improved photoswitchable probes and future directions are also discussed.







Abstract
Decoding cellular processes requires visualization of the spatial distribution and dynamic interactions of biomolecules. It is therefore not surprising that innovations in imaging technologies have facilitated advances in biomedical research. The advent of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies has empowered biomedical researchers with the ability to answer long&#8208;standing questions about cellular processes at an entirely new level. Fluorescent probes greatly enhance the specificity and resolution of super&#8208;resolution imaging experiments. Here, we introduce key super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies, with a brief discussion on single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We evaluate the chemistry and photochemical mechanisms of fluorescent probes employed in SMLM. This Review provides guidance on the identification and adoption of fluorescent probes in single molecule localization microscopy to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation fluorescent probes amenable to single&#8208;molecule imaging.

         <title>Optimal Dihedral Angle in Twisted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Organic Emitters for Maximized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physical origin of the optimal dihedral angle of &#8776;80&#176; in twisted donor&#8211;acceptor organic emitters for maximized TADF is deduced and an effective design strategy for efficient TADF emitters is proposed, which provides help for the molecular design and screening of high&#8208;efficiency TADF materials.







Abstract
The twisted donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) organic formwork with a large dihedral angle (&#952;DA) is usually adopted to narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap for obtaining excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, the dependence of overall TADF properties on &#952;DA has not been systematically investigated to this day. Taking new designed CzBP, CzBP&#8208;1M and CzBP&#8208;2M via introducing methyl as investigated models, it is found that (i) with increasing &#952;DA, the charge transfer component in S1 is larger than that in T1 in varying degrees, leading to non&#8208;monotonic spin&#8208;orbit couplings; (ii) the electron&#8208;vibration couplings between S1 and T1 states become the largest when &#952;DA approaching 80&#176;, facilitating phonon&#8208;driven up&#8208;conversion; (iii) the overall TADF rate reaches a peak at &#952;DA&#8776;80&#176;. By this, the TADF on/off switching is realized via methyl moiety for regulating &#952;DA from theoretical prediction to experimental confirmation. Importantly, the &#952;DA near 80&#176; would be a good descriptor for screening excellent D&#8208;A type TADF emitters.

         <title>Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imines as Super Nucleophiles in Catalytic Couplings of Amides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (mNHI) based superbases are introduced in this work. The mNHIs were utilized as metal&#8208;free catalysts in transformations using CO2 for the coupling of amides.







Abstract
An extended class of stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (mNHIs), containing a highly polarized exocyclic imine moiety, were synthesized. The calculated proton affinities (PA) and experimentally determined Tolman electronic parameters (TEPs) reveal that these synthesized mNHIs have the highest basicity and donor ability among NHIs reported so far. The superior nucleophilicity of newly designed mNHIs was utilized in devising a strategy to incorporate CO2 as a bridging unit under reductive conditions to couple inert primary amides. This strategy was further extended to hetero&#8208;couplings between amide and amine using CO2. These hitherto unknown catalytic transformations were introduced in the diversification of various biologically active drug molecules under metal&#8208;free conditions. The underlying mechanism was explored by performing a series of control experiments, characterizing key intermediates using spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough and Recyclable Ionogels Constructed by Coordinated Supramolecular Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and recyclable ionogels are constructed by physical cross&#8208;linking of coordinated supramolecular solvents and linear polymer segments. The solvents in ionogels function as 3D supramolecular networks, which provide strong mechanical support for ionogels.







Abstract
The mechanical properties of most hydrogels (ionogels) are considerably affected by covalently cross&#8208;linked networks. However, the interactions between solvent/solvent molecules and solvent/polymer chains are usually ignored. Herein, a series of ultra&#8208;tough ionogels were prepared via a supramolecular solvent, halometallate ionic liquid, in which cations and coordinating anions form a 3D supramolecular network. The linear polymer chains are physically cross&#8208;linked with supramolecular solvents synergistically enhancing the strength (14.3&#8197;MPa), toughness (78&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (55&#8197;MPa) of ionogels, effectively dispersing the stress concentration under load, and obtaining better fatigue resistance and higher fracture energy (198&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the reversible cross&#8208;linking enables green recovery and recycling of ionogels, simply by water. This strategy shows broad applicability based on a variety of supramolecular solvents and coordinatable polymers.

         <title>Thermally Stable Polymer&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Safe Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes is tamed by introducing polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase in situ upon lithium anode. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer provides both high thermal and electrochemical stability, enhancing the safety and lifespan of lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch. The &#8220;ignition&#8221; temperature of the battery can be increased to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C benefiting from excellent electrolyte design.







Abstract
Serious safety risks caused by the high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes severely hamper the practicability of lithium metal batteries. By introducing unique polymerization site and more fluoride substitution, we built an in situ formed polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode to improve battery safety. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer exhibits high thermal stability, which effectively reduces the continuous exothermic reaction between electrolyte and anode/cathode. As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0&#8197;Ah lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell can be increased from 143.2&#8201;&#176;C to 174.2&#8201;&#176;C. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0&#8201;&#176;C to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0&#8197;Ah lithium-LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell can be increased from 143.2&#8201;&#176;C to 174.2&#8201;&#176;C. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0&#8201;&#176;C to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high-energy-density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected Formation and Potent Antioxidant Activity of Macrocyclic Dimers Containing Disulfide and Selenide Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation and hydrolysis of selenides containing alkyl or benzylic bis(thioacetoxy) groups resulted in the unexpected formation of macrocyclic dimers, each containing two selenide and two disulfide bonds. These compounds exhibited potent catalytic antioxidant activity. Kinetic experiments indicated an autocatalytic mechanism involving the corresponding selenoxide and hydroxy perhydroxy selenurane intermediates.







Abstract
During attempts to prepare spirodithiaselenuranes as GPx mimetics, a series of unexpected dimeric macrocycles was obtained, each containing two selenide and two disulfide moieties in rings ranging from 18&#8208; to 26&#8208;membered. The products showed potent GPx&#8208;like activity in an NMR assay based on their ability to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with benzyl thiol. The high catalytic activity was attributed to transannular effects during selenide to selenoxide oxidation. This redox process was also characterized by an induction period that indicated autocatalysis in the formation of an intermediate selenoxide from the oxidation of the corresponding selenide.

         <title>A Carboranyl Electrolyte Enabling Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Anodes via a &#8220;Fluorine&#8208;Free&#8221; SEI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the pairing of a novel non&#8208;fluorine containing carboranyl electrolyte with pure sodium metal anodes which yields highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free cell cycling. Solid electrolyte interphase characterization and investigation of sodium metal deposition/stripping processes suggests the electrolyte presented herein is a reliable candidate to enable anode&#8208;free cells.







Abstract
Realization of practical sodium metal batteries (SMBs) is hindered due to lack of compatible electrolyte components, dendrite propagation, and poor understanding of anodic interphasial chemistries. Chemically robust liquid electrolytes that facilitate both favorable sodium metal deposition and a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) are ideal to enable sodium metal and anode&#8208;free cells. Herein we present advanced characterization of a novel fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte utilizing the [HCB11H11]1&#8722; anion. Symmetrical Na cells operated with this electrolyte exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 0.032&#8197;V at a current density of 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% in half&#8208;cell configurations. Surface characterization of electrodes post&#8208;operation reveals the absence of dendritic sodium nucleation and a surprisingly stable fluorine&#8208;free SEI. Furthermore, weak ion&#8208;pairing is identified as key towards the successful development of fluorine&#8208;free sodium electrolytes.

         <title>Activating Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts in Acidic Electrolytes using Hydrophobic Cavities and Proton&#8208;conductive Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on how to overcome the deactivation of N&#8208;doped graphene catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media based on the mechanistic understanding. Compatible suppression of the hydration of protonated pyridinic&#8208;N (pyri&#8208;NH+) by hydrophobic cavity and the introduction of proton conductivity by proton&#8208;conductive particles made N&#8208;doped graphenes close to Pt catalysts under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Although pyridinic&#8208;nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) doped graphene is highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells in alkaline media, the activity critically decreases under acidic conditions. We report on how to prevent the deactivation based on the mechanistic understanding that 
 governs the ORR kinetics. First, we considered that the deactivation is due to the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+, leading to a lower shift of the redox potential. Introducing the hydrophobic cavity prevented the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+ but inhibited the proton transport. We then increased proton conductivity in the hydrophobic cavity by introducing SiO2 particles coated with ionic liquid polymer/Nafion&#174; which kept the high onset potentials with an increased current density even in acidic media.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymeric systems for bioconversion is an efficient and recyclable technology for the future industry due to its zero&#8208;pollution features. This Review focuses on self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized structures and their application as biocatalytic reactors for chemical synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is increasingly being explored for the sustainable development of green industry. Though enzymes show great industrial potential with their high efficiency, specificity, and selectivity, they suffer from poor usability and stability under abiological conditions. To solve these problems, researchers have fabricated nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized biocatalytic reactors based on the self&#8208;assembly of various polymers, leading to highly stable, functional, and reusable biocatalytic systems. This Review highlights recent progress in self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and microreactors for biocatalytic synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions. We categorize these reactors into monophasic and biphasic systems and discuss their structural characteristics and latest successes with representative examples. We also consider the challenges and potential solutions associated with the future development of this field.

         <title>Edge&#8208;hosted Atomic Co&#8722;N4 Sites on Hierarchical Porous Carbon for Highly Selective Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;hosted Co&#8722;N4 sites in the carbon matrix are more efficient and selective than basal plane&#8208;hosted ones in catalyzing 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR, achieving a remarkable selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% in the electrochemical production of H2O2.







Abstract
Not only high efficiency but also high selectivity of the electrocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we systematically investigate the edge effect of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways (two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) or four&#8208;electron (4&#8201;e&#8722;)) and conclude that the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR proceeding over the edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co&#8722;N4 sites is more favorable than the basal&#8208;plane&#8208;hosted ones. As such, we have successfully synthesized and tuned Co&#8208;SACs with different edge&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratios. The as&#8208;prepared edge&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N/HPC catalyst exhibits excellent 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR performance with a remarkable selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% in a wide potential range. Furthermore, we also find that oxygen functional groups could saturate the graphitic carbon edges under the ORR operation and further promote electrocatalytic performance. These findings on the structure&#8211;property relationship in SACs offer a promising direction for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electrochemical H2O2 production via the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR.

These findings on the structure&#8211;property relationship in SACs offer a promising direction for large-scale and low-cost electrochemical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production via the 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-ORR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Alternating Polyisocyanate Copolymers by Anionic Polymerization for Mimicking Amphiphilic Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural similarity is demonstrated (see picture) between amphiphilic helical peptides (left) and amphiphilic alternating polyisocyanate copolymer (right). Phase segregation along the long axis is shown in orange and blue, represented by a Janus portrait. Hydrophobic moieties are denoted by orange while hydrophilic cations are denoted by blue with a plus sign.







Abstract
The amphiphilic conformation of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides has important biological functions, such as ion transport, antifreeze, and innate immunity, which can be mimicked by alternating polyisocyanate copolymers. We synthesized poly(allyl isocyanate&#8208;alt&#8208;(S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl isocyanate (P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)) and ammonium&#8208;containing P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) (N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)), ensuring the amphiphilic helical conformation. The benzyl group of SMBIC plays an important role in alternating copolymerization with its steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, while AIC provides an alkene group capable of introducing a customized functional group. The P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) with predominantly alternating sequence was acquired at fSMBIC/fAIC=8 with a controlled molecular weight and narrow dispersity. N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)s were synthesized from thiol&#8208;ene radical addition with P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC).

         <title>A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox&#8208;Coupled Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid (TN&#8208;COF@CNT) enables a long&#8208;range charge transfer relay and a high&#8208;rate dual&#8208;redox for the realization of efficient photo coupled ions transfer process. Equipped with such a photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery achieves reliable photoresponses, enhanced battery efficiency, stability and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage efficiency of 1.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low&#8208;cost solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long&#8208;lived separated charges (&#964;ave=3.0&#8197;ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor&#8208;acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high&#8208;rate redox of &#8722;C=O/&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and &#8722;C&#8722;N/&#8722;C=N+ with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1&#8201;% at 1&#8197;sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron&#8208;enriching &#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and hole&#8208;enriching &#8722;C=N+ groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn2+ and OTf&#8722; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.

         <title>Competitive Non&#8208;Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH3 Oxidation and H2O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is found to be a highly effective and stable catalyst for driving photoelectrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction via a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack mechanism under near&#8208;neutral pH. The selectivity of the ammonia oxidation reaction can be precisely tuned by manipulating the proportion of two surface species including Fe&#8722;O species and Fe&#8722;N species on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3.







Abstract
The sluggish H2O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, we find a 10 to 55&#8208;fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes under near&#8208;neutral pH (9&#8211;11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0&#8211;1.4&#8197;VRHE) compared to H2O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high&#8208;valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., FeIV=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NOx&#8722; and N2, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2O on surface FeIV=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80&#8201;% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical&#8208;mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Michael Acceptors to Penetrate Cells: Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake with Tetrel&#8208;Centered Exchange Cascades, Assisted by Halogen&#8208;Bonding Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduced as the first explicitly tetrel&#8208;centered cascade exchangers, Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, generate distinct patterns in heatmaps to decode uptake circuitry, integrate novel halogen&#8208;bonding switches, deliver proteins to the cytosol, and break, as dimers, records for uptake inhibition related to drug discovery.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;centered cascade exchange chemistry is increasingly understood to account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, that is, the ability of reversibly thiol&#8208;reactive agents to penetrate cells. Here, reversible Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, including the cytosolic delivery of proteins. Dynamic cyano&#8208;cinnamate dimers rival the best chalcogen&#8208;centered inhibitors. Patterns generated in inhibition heatmaps reveal contributions from halogen&#8208;bonding switches that occur independent from the thyroid transporter MCT8. The uniqueness of these patterns supports that the entry of tetrel&#8208;centered exchangers into cells differs from chalcogen&#8208;centered systems. These results expand the chemical space of thiol&#8208;mediated uptake and support the existence of a universal exchange network to bring matter into cells, abiding to be decoded for drug delivery and drug discovery in the broadest sense.

We report a bimodal probe to detect the hypoxic tumor by both fluorescence and chemical shift dependent 19F NMR imaging under the catalysis of nitroreductase. Specifically, the concentration of nitroreductase can be detected in a broad range by fluorescence and 19F MR, which is &#8804;1.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and 10&#8211;50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Nitroreductase (NTR) is an important biomarker widely used to evaluate the degree of tumor hypoxia. Although a few optical methods have been reported for detecting nitroreductase at low concentration ranges, an effective strategy for nitroreductase monitoring in vivo without limits to the imaging depth is still lacking. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;mode NIR fluorescence and 19F MRI agent, FCy7&#8208;NO2, is proposed for imaging tumor hypoxia. We show that FCy7&#8208;NO2 serves as not only a rapid NIR fluorescence enhanced probe for monitoring and bioimaging of nitroreductase in tumors, but also a novel 19F MR chemical shift&#8208;sensitive contrast agent for selectively detecting nitroreductase catalyzed reduction. Notably, integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit. In general, this agent has a remarkable response to nitroreductase, which provides a promising method for understanding tumor evolution and its physiological role in the hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power plants release CO2 and gaseous impurities into the atmosphere. In recent years, the effect of gaseous impurities on CO2 electrolysis has emerged as an important research topic, with an emphasis placed on understanding the catalytic reaction and developing mitigation strategies to lessen the negative effects of gaseous impurities.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of waste CO2 into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO2 reduction studies use pure CO2 as the gas reactant, but CO2 emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities, such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO2 can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO2 electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO2 reduction studies using mixed&#8208;gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO2 reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.

         <title>Dynamic B/N Lewis Pairs: Insights into the Structural Variations and Photochromism via Light&#8208;Induced Fluorescence to Phosphorescence Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a series of ring&#8208;constrained B/N Lewis pairs (LPs) as modular systems, we have engineered the electronic interactions between B Lewis acid and N Lewis base sites by systematically tuning the steric effects, culminating in the discovery of a unique method to achieve rarely accessible room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials via photochemical activation of fluorescent heavy atom&#8208;free organic materials.







Abstract
Ultralong afterglow emissions due to room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are of paramount importance in the advancement of smart sensors, bioimaging and light&#8208;emitting devices. We herein present an efficient approach to achieve rarely accessible phosphorescence of heavy atom&#8208;free organoboranes via photochemical switching of sterically tunable fluorescent Lewis pairs (LPs). LPs are widely applied in and well&#8208;known for their outstanding performance in catalysis and supramolecular soft materials but have not thus far been exploited to develop photo&#8208;responsive RTP materials. The intramolecular LP M1BNM not only shows a dynamic response to thermal treatment due to reversible N&#8594;B coordination but crystals of M1BNM also undergo rapid photochromic switching. As a result, unusual emission switching from short&#8208;lived fluorescence to long&#8208;lived phosphorescence (rad&#8208;M1BNM, &#964;RTP=232&#8197;ms) is observed. The reported discoveries in the field of Lewis pairs chemistry offer important insights into their structural dynamics, while also pointing to new opportunities for photoactive materials with implications for fast responsive detectors.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dissolution of Precious Metals by TiO2 through Photogenerated Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on experimental and theoretical results, this work explores the mechanism of photocatalytic precious metal dissolution. It is clear that photogenerated radicals and ligand molecules are the keys to precious metal dissolution, and the process has potential significance for enhancing photocatalytic selective recovery of precious metals.







Abstract
Exploring the pathways for photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals (PMs) is crucial for optimizing recovery. In this work, we systematically investigated the selectivity and solvation effects observed for dissolution by focusing on photocatalysis, precious metals and solvents. By combining transient characterization, reaction kinetics, and density functional theory, we determined that the radicals generated in photocatalysis were the key active species in the entire reaction. The cyano functional group in the solvent was the driving factor for dissolution of gold, and the importance of chlorine radicals for dissolution of platinum group precious metals was further confirmed. In addition, the catalytic properties of different precious metals can promote different transformations of functional groups, leading to selective dissolution. The structures of photocatalytic precious metal leaches also precisely explains the special coordination forms of precious metals and functional group ligands.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstructed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Heterojunction for Switchable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reconstructed metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy, and it exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability.







Abstract
Designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability simultaneously is highly required yet very challenging due to the limited intrinsic activity and their elusive evolution under harsh OER conditions. Herein, a steady self&#8208;reconstructed MOF heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy. Thanks to the inhibiting effect from hydrogen bonds of Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;1 (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid), the obatained MOF heterojunction shows greatly improved OER activity with low overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, relative to the totally reconstructed Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;3 (332&#8197;mV). Density function theory calculations reveal that the formed built&#8208;in electric field in the MOF heterojunction remarkably optimizes the ad/desorption free energy of active Ni sites. Moreover, such MOF heterojunction shows superior durability attributed to the shielding effect of the surface&#8208;evolved NiOOH coating.

         <title>Upgrading Kolbe Electrolysis&#8212;Highly Efficient Production of Green Fuels and Solvents by Coupling Biosynthesis and Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking Kolbe electrolysis that converts biobased acids with microbial fermentation of gaseous electrolysis products in a paired electrolyser creates a highly efficient production route for fuel additives and solvents.







Abstract
The chemical industry is transitioning to more sustainable and biobased processes. One key element of this transition is coupling energy fluxes and feedstock utilization for optimizing processes, routes and efficiencies. Here, we show for the first time the coupling of the Kolbe electrolysis at the anode with a subsequent microbial conversion of the cathodically produced co&#8208;product hydrogen. Kolbe electrolysis of valeric acid yields the liquid drop&#8208;in fuel additive n&#8208;octane. Subsequently, the solvent isopropanol is produced by resting Cupriavidus necator cells using gaseous electrolysis products (esp. CO2 and H2). The resting microbial cells show carbon efficiencies of up to 41&#8201;% and Coulombic/Faradaic efficiencies of 60&#8201;% and 80&#8201;% for anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. The implementation of a paired electrolyser resulted in superior process performances with overall efficiencies of up to 64.4&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;Linking Kolbe electrolysis that converts biobased acids with microbial fermentation of gaseous electrolysis products in a paired electrolyser creates a highly efficient production route for fuel additives and solvents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical industry is transitioning to more sustainable and biobased processes. One key element of this transition is coupling energy fluxes and feedstock utilization for optimizing processes, routes and efficiencies. Here, we show for the first time the coupling of the Kolbe electrolysis at the anode with a subsequent microbial conversion of the cathodically produced co-product hydrogen. Kolbe electrolysis of valeric acid yields the liquid drop-in fuel additive &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-octane. Subsequently, the solvent isopropanol is produced by resting &lt;i&gt;Cupriavidus necator&lt;/i&gt; cells using gaseous electrolysis products (esp. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The resting microbial cells show carbon efficiencies of up to 41&#8201;% and Coulombic/Faradaic efficiencies of 60&#8201;% and 80&#8201;% for anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. The implementation of a paired electrolyser resulted in superior process performances with overall efficiencies of up to 64.4&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 2.75&#8197;V ammonium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We bypassed the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and promoted the NH4+ ion battery toward a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75&#8197;V by co&#8208;utilizing the storage of the other significant charge carrier in electrolytes, viz, anions, realizing a high&#8208;voltage metal&#8208;free battery.







Abstract
The popular metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) suffer from environmental and economic issues because of their heavy dependency on nonrenewable metals. Here, we propose a metal&#8208;free ammonium (NH4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery with a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75&#8197;V. The working mechanism of this sustainable battery involves the reversible anion (PF6&#8722;) intercalation chemistry in graphite cathode and NH4+ intercalation behavior in PTCDI (3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide) anode. This new battery configuration successfully circumvented the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and the lack of mature NH4+&#8208;rich cathodes for NH4+ ion batteries (AIBs). The customized organic NH4+ electrolyte endows the graphite||PTCDI full battery with durable longevity (over 1000&#8197;cycles) and a high energy density (200&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). We show that the development of AIBs should be high&#8208;voltage&#8208;oriented while circumventing low operation potential to avoid NH4+ reduction.

         <title>Electrical Pulse Induced One&#8208;step Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pt on Oxide Clusters for Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrical pulse approach is employed to obtain dispersed Pt on diverse oxide clusters in one step with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon being the support. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Pt1&#8722;FeOx/CN enable the Zinc&#8208;Air batteries to achieve an excellent electrochemical performance at ultralow temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed sites anchored on small oxide clusters are attractive new catalytic materials. Herein, we demonstrate an electrical pulse approach to synthesize atomically dispersed Pt on various oxide clusters in one step with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as the support (Pt1&#8722;MOx/CN). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Pt1&#8722;FeOx/CN is shown to exhibit high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94&#8197;V vs RHE, in contrast to the poor catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt on large Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Our work has revealed that, by tuning the size of the iron oxide down to the cluster regime, an optimal OH* adsorption strength for ORR is achieved on Pt1&#8722;FeOx/CN due to the regulation of Pt&#8722;O bonds. The unique structure and high catalytic performance of Pt1&#8722;FeOx/CN enable the Zinc&#8208;Air batteries an excellent performance at ultralow temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C with a high peak power density of 45.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable cycling stability up to 120&#8197;h.

         <title>Multiple Roles of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Ligands in Direct Formation of H2O2 over Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the reaction conditions of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) decorated Pd, we find that the RS are oxidized yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the formation of H2O2. The superior selectivity and yield by thiolate&#8208;decorated Pd as compared to uncoated Pd nanoparticles are confirmed by experiments.







Abstract
Coadsorbed organic species including thiolates can promote direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd particles. Here, density functional theory based kinetic modeling, augmented with activity measurements and vibrational spectroscopy are used to provide atomistic understanding of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) Pd. We find that the RS species are oxidized during reaction conditions yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the formation of H2O2. The ligands promote the selectivity also by blocking sites for unselective water formation and by modifying the electronic structure of Pd. The work rationalizes observations of enhanced selectivity of direct H2O2 formation over ligand&#8208;funtionalized Pd nanoparticles and shows that engineering of organic surface modifiers can be used to promote desired hydrogen transfer routes.

         <title>The Function of Two Radical&#8208;SAM Enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, in the Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, which catalyzes reversible hydride transfer from H2 to an organic substrate. HcgA and HcgG are involved in the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor. In vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated the functions of these two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes. HcgA biosynthesizes the initial pyridinol precursor, and HcgG contributes to the formation of the CO and acyl ligands.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (1) is 3&#8208;methylated to form 2, then 4&#8208;guanylylated to form 3, and converted into the full cofactor. HcgA&#8208;G proteins catalyze the biosynthetic reactions. Herein, we report the function of two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, as uncovered by in vitro complementation experiments and the use of purified enzymes. In vitro biosynthesis using the cell extract from the Methanococcus maripaludis &#916;hcgA strain was complemented with HcgA or precursors 1, 2 or 3. The results suggested that HcgA catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction that forms 1. We demonstrated the formation of 1 by HcgA using the 3&#8197;kDa cell extract filtrate as the substrate. Biosynthesis in the &#916;hcgG system was recovered by HcgG but not by 3, which indicated that HcgG catalyzes the reactions after the biosynthesis of 3. The data indicated that HcgG contributes to the formation of CO and completes biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor.

         <title>Bimetallic Aluminum&#8208; and Niobium&#8208;Doped MCM&#8208;41 for Efficient Conversion of Biomass&#8208;Derived 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran to Pentadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective conversion of biomass&#8208;derived 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) into pentadienes has been achieved over an aluminum and niobium bimetallic atomically doped MCM&#8208;41. The NbV sites enhance the catalytic performance by binding 2&#8208;MTHF.







Abstract
The production of conjugated C4&#8211;C5 dienes from biomass can enable the sustainable synthesis of many important polymers and liquid fuels. Here, we report the first example of bimetallic (Nb, Al)&#8208;atomically doped mesoporous silica, denoted as AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41, which affords quantitative conversion of 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) to pentadienes with a high selectivity of 91&#8201;%. The incorporation of AlIII and NbV sites into the framework of AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 has effectively tuned the nature and distribution of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites within the structure. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption, diffuse reflectance infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy collectively reveal the molecular mechanism of the conversion of adsorbed 2&#8208;MTHF over AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41. Specifically, the atomically&#8208;dispersed NbV sites play an important role in binding 2&#8208;MTHF to drive the conversion. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hetero&#8208;atomic mesoporous solids for the manufacture of renewable materials.

         <title>Stepwise Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization Enabled Mimetic Synthesis of Axially Chiral B,N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique effect on the promotion of stereospecific isomerization.







Abstract
Axially chiral molecules bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of great importance in the field of organic chemistry. However, the efficient construction of atropisomers featuring two different types of stereogenic axes has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the novel atroposelective synthesis of configurationally stable axially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles. By using stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were also obtained. In this case, all four stereoisomers of diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles were stereodivergently afforded in high enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique role in the promotion of stereospecific isomerization, thereby leading to the highly efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Host Spin&#8208;Crossover Thermodynamics Indicate Guest Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of fit between the binding partners within a host&#8211;guest complex is crucial for a highly selective interaction, yet difficult to separate from non&#8208;covalent interactions between the partners. The spin&#8208;crossover of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular host can be used to quantify guest fit, providing a new tool to describe host&#8211;guest binding that is complementary to binding constant determination.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) metal&#8208;organic cages capable of switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states have the potential to be used as magnetic sensors and switches. Variation of the donor strength of heterocyclic aldehyde subcomponents in imine&#8208;based ligands can tune the ligand field for a FeII center, which results in both homoleptic and heteroleptic cages with diverse SCO behaviors. The tetrahedral SCO cage built from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde is capable of encapsulating various guests, which stabilize different cage spin states depending on guest size. Conversely, the SCO tetrahedron exhibits different affinities for guests in different spin states, which is inferred to result from subtle structural differences of the cavity caused by the change in metal center spin state. Examination of SCO thermodynamics across a series of host&#8211;guest complexes enabled sensitive probing of guest fit to the host cavity, providing information complementary to binding&#8208;constant determination.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Cyanoboration of Internal Allenes by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 and NCTS derivatives has been developed. MeOH was identified as the necessary additive for the regeneration of LCu&#8208;Bpin species. Computational studies revealed that the copper&#8208;mediated allylic cyanation is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while the MeOH&#8208;assisted transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 (bis(pinacolato)diboron) and NCTS (N&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide) derivatives is reported. The &#946;,&#947;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;cyanoborylated products were synthesized with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Computational studies revealed that nucleophilic addition of allylcopper or related intermediates on cyanation reagent is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step. The nucleophilic addition step proceeds via inner&#8208;sphere mechanism in the CuI/P(o&#8208;tol)3 and CuI/Xantphos (P(o&#8208;tol)3=tris(o&#8208;methylphenyl)phosphine, Xantphos=4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) catalytic systems and via outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in the CuII/Xantphos catalytic system, respectively.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Alkene Metathesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation is reported. Key to the process is a selective conversion of stereodynamic trienes by a chiral molybdenum catalyst, providing configurationally&#8208;stable atropisomers under mild conditions in excellent yields with of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.







Abstract
Alkene metathesis catalyzed by enantiopure metal alkylidene complexes enables exceptionally versatile strategies to products with configurationally&#8208;defined stereocenters. Desymmetrization processes thereby provide reliable stereoselective routes to aliphatic structures, while the differentiation of aromatic stereogenic units remained an outstanding challenge. Herein, we describe the feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation. Stereodynamic trienes are selectively converted into corresponding binaphthalene atropisomers upon exposure to a chiral molybdenum catalyst. Remarkably, stereoselective arene&#8208;forming metathesis allows enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r. and excellent yields. As the disconnection of each bond of an aromatic target is retrosynthetically conceivable, it is anticipated that forging arenes by means of stereoselective metathesis will enable versatile approaches for the synthesis of a broad range of molecular topologies with precisely defined configuration.

&lt;p&gt;Alkene metathesis catalyzed by enantiopure metal alkylidene complexes enables exceptionally versatile strategies to products with configurationally-defined stereocenters. Desymmetrization processes thereby provide reliable stereoselective routes to aliphatic structures, while the differentiation of aromatic stereogenic units remained an outstanding challenge. Herein, we describe the feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation. Stereodynamic trienes are selectively converted into corresponding binaphthalene atropisomers upon exposure to a chiral molybdenum catalyst. Remarkably, stereoselective arene-forming metathesis allows enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r. and excellent yields. As the disconnection of each bond of an aromatic target is retrosynthetically conceivable, it is anticipated that forging arenes by means of stereoselective metathesis will enable versatile approaches for the synthesis of a broad range of molecular topologies with precisely defined configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Protonation Kinetics&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Nitrogen Electroreduction: Achieving 75.05&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the key intermediates&#8242; behaviors on the catalyst&#8216;s surface through modifying the electronic interplay among active sites can realize the adjusting of protonation kinetics. This work unravels the crucial factors of protonation kinetics to obtain superior alkaline nitrogen electroreduction selectivity and describes the protonation kinetics&#8208;independent selectivity relation, giving a deep understanding of the complicated and elusive nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) mechanisms.







Abstract
While higher selectivity of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is always achieved in alkali, the selectivity dependence on nitrogen (N2) protonation and mechanisms therein are unrevealed. Herein, we profile how the NRR selectivity theoretically relies upon the first protonation that is collectively regulated by proton (H) abundance and adsorption&#8208;desorption, along with intermediate&#8208;*NNH formation. By incorporating electronic metal modulators (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in nitrogenase&#8208;imitated model&#8208;iron polysulfide (FeSx), a series of FeMSx catalysts with tailorable protonation kinetics are obtained. The key intermediates behaviors traced by in situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman spectroscopy and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the strong protonation kinetics&#8208;dependent selectivity that mathematically follows a log&#8208;linear Bradley curve. Strikingly, FeCuSx exhibits a record&#8208;high selectivity of 75.05&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs. RHE) for NH3 production in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte.

         <title>Genome Mining Enabled by Biosynthetic Characterization Uncovers a Class of Benzoxazolinate&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Diverse Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA. It was found that a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase mediates the last cyclization step to afford benzoxazolinate. The enzyme was then used as a probe for genome mining, which led to the discovery of a new class of benzoxazolinate&#8208;containing compounds in diverse bacteria.







Abstract
Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C&#8208;1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Herein, we show a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We used the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discovered that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that Pseudomonas chlororaphis produces various benzobactins, whose biosynthesis is highlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production; the formation of non&#8208;proteinogenic 2&#8208;hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Ultralong Afterglow Emission with Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching from CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution processed CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn perovskite exhibit highly efficient (81.5&#8201;%) afterglow emission (150&#8197;s) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400&#8197;K. We further demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.







Abstract
Triplet exciton&#8208;based long&#8208;lived phosphorescence is severely limited by the thermal quenching at high temperature. Herein, we propose a novel strategy based on the energy transfer from triplet self&#8208;trapped excitons to Mn2+ dopants in solution&#8208;processed perovskite CsCdCl3. It is found the Mn2+ doped hexagonal phase CsCdCl3 could simultaneously exhibit high emission efficiency (81.5&#8201;%) and long afterglow duration time (150&#8197;s). Besides, the afterglow emission exhibits anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400&#8197;K. In&#8208;depth charge&#8208;carrier dynamics studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculation provide unambiguous evidence that carrier detrapping from trap states (mainly induced by Cl vacancy) to localized emission centers ([MnCl6]4&#8722;) is responsible for the afterglow emission with anti&#8208;thermal quenching. Enlightened by the present results, we demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Blown Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is utilized to prepare self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams by in situ generating the blowing agent (CO2) during the polymer network formation. The partial hydrolysis of one of the comonomers, the cyclic carbonate, generates the blowing agent. The process is facile, versatile, up scalable, uses low cost readily available reagents, can be complete in 30&#8197;minutes and is compatible to existing infrastructures for polymer foaming.







Abstract
For 80&#8197;years, polyisocyanates and polyols were central building blocks for the industrial fabrication of polyurethane (PU) foams. By their partial hydrolysis, isocyanates release CO2 that expands the PU network. Substituting this toxic isocyanate&#8208;based chemistry by a more sustainable variant&#8212;that in situ forms CO2 by hydrolysis of a comonomer&#8212;is urgently needed for producing greener cellular materials. Herein, we report a facile, up&#8208;scalable process, potentially compatible to existing infrastructures, to rapidly prepare water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) foams. We show that formulations composed of poly(cyclic carbonate)s and polyamines furnish rigid or flexible NIPU foams by partial hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in the presence of a catalyst. By utilizing readily available low cost starting materials, this simple but robust process gives access to greener PU foams, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of many sectors.

         <title>Tailored Cross&#8208;&#946; Assemblies Establish Peptide &#8220;Dominos&#8221; Structures for Anchoring Undruggable Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the peptide chain, the tilt angle of the &#946;&#8208;sheets in the self&#8208;assembly could be manipulated to form a collapsed&#8208;domino&#8208;like structure, resulting in a controllable display of the active sites for PD&#8208;L1 recognition.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;sheets have the ability to hierarchically stack into assemblies, and much effort has been spent on designing different peptides to regulate their assembly behaviors. Although the progress is remarkable, it remains challenging to manipulate them in a controllable way for achieving both tailored structures and specific functions. In this study, we obtained bola&#8208;like peptides using de novo design and combinatorial chemical screening. By regulating the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the peptide chain, a series of assemblies with different tilt angles and active sites of the &#946;&#8208;sheet were obtained, resembling collapsed dominos. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of the optimized peptide NQ40 system was established and its ability to target the PD&#8208;L1 was demonstrated. This study successfully established the structure&#8208;function relationship of &#946;&#8208;sheets assemblies and has positive implications on the rational design of peptide assemblies that possess recognition abilities.

Although the progress is remarkable, it remains challenging to manipulate them in a controllable way for achieving both tailored structures and specific functions. In this study, we obtained bola-like peptides using de novo design and combinatorial chemical screening. By regulating the solvent-accessible surface area of the peptide chain, a series of assemblies with different tilt angles and active sites of the &#946;-sheet were obtained, resembling collapsed dominos. The structure-activity relationship of the optimized peptide NQ40 system was established and its ability to target the PD-L1 was demonstrated. This study successfully established the structure-function relationship of &#946;-sheets assemblies and has positive implications on the rational design of peptide assemblies that possess recognition abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Uranium Complexes with a Pendant Borane Lewis Acid and 1,2&#8208;Insertion of CO into a U&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between the highly strained uranacycle I with various boranes afford unprecedented uranium complexes bearing either a pendant borate or a pendant borane Lewis acid. The latter promotes the 1,2&#8208;insertion of CO into a UIV&#8208;N bond.







Abstract
In this contribution, we illustrate uranium complexes bearing a pendant borate (i.e. 1 and 2) or a pendant borane (i.e. 3 and 4) moiety via reaction of the highly strained uranacycle I with various 3&#8208;coordinate boranes. Complexes 3 and 4 represent the first examples of uranium complexes with a pendant borane Lewis acid. Moreover, complex 3 was capable of activation of CO, delivering a new CO activation mode, and an abnormal CO 1,2&#8208;insertion pathway into a U&#8722;N bond. The importance of the pendant borane moiety was confirmed by the controlled experiments.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead&#8208;Tin Bromide with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, shows not only strong self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) but also intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with perfect host&#8208;guest structures are promising candidates to construct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. However, it still remains challenging to obtain 0D chiral metal halides with simultaneously strong CPL and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, a new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O), is reported. The R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O compounds not only show intriguing self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, but also present intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. Such CPL activities originate from the asymmetric [SnBr6]4&#8722; luminophores in R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, due to the induced structural chirality by the organic ligands via N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CPL emissions with tunable colors from R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and dehydrated compounds are reversibly observed, which extends their chiroptical applications.

         <title>Polyphosphinoborane Block Copolymer Synthesis using Catalytic Reversible Chain Transfer Dehydropolymerization.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic block copolymer of polyphosphinoborane&#160;has been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the sequential catalytic dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#183;PRH2 (R = Ph, n&#8208;hexyl), using the simple pre&#8208;catalyst [Rh(Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2)2]Cl. Speciation, mechanism and polymer chain growth studies support a step&#8208;growth process where reversible chain transfer occurs, i.e. H3B&#183;PRH2/oligomer/polymer can all coordinate with, and be activated by, the catalyst. Block copolymer [H2BPPhH]110&#8211;b&#8211;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11 can be synthesized and self&#8208;assembles in solution to form either rod&#8208;like micelles or vesicles depending on solvent polarity.</dc:description>

This mild and metal&#8208;free protocol was employed to prepare a wide array of alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupled products and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups.

         <title>Regulating the Mechanical and Optical Properties of Polymer&#8208;based Nanocomposites by Sub&#8208;Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanowires (SNWs) exhibit great potential applications in nanocomposites owing to their high specific surface area, high flexibility, and similarity to polymer chains in dimension, which are a good entry point to bridge inorganic materials and polymer materials. Herein, we synthesized hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and engineered hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels and films by simple mixing of HAP SNWs and polyimide (PI). Benefiting from the interactions between HAP SNWs and PI, these nanocomposites were a continuous hybrid network. As the increase of HAP SNWs contents, the viscosity and modulus of HSP gels were greatly improved by one or two orders of magnitude compared with PI gel. HSP films not only maintained high transparency but also gained high haze, as well as exhibited enhanced Young's modulus. Thus, both HSP gels and films developed in this work are promising for various applications in coatings and high&#8208;performance films.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active N&#8208;(fluoromethoxy)benzotriazoles were made accessible from fluoroacetic acid and hydroxybenzotriazoles via electrodecarboxylative coupling. After alkylation, they become effective monofluoromethoxylation reagents, enabling the photocatalytic C&#8208;H functionalization of arenes. Thus, irradiation of 1&#8208;(OCH2F)&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;6&#8208;(CF3)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers. This method allows the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant structures without relying on ecologically problematic halofluorocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Transport in Dichromic Metallo&#8208;organic Crystals Selective Inclusion of Spatially Resolved Arrays of Donor and Acceptor Dyes in Different Nanochannels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the precise positioning and alignment of arrays of two different guest molecules in a crystalline host matrix has been engineered resulting in new optically&#8208;active materials. Sub&#8208;nm differences in the diameters of two types of 1D channels is sufficient for size&#8208;selective inclusion of dyes. Energy transport occurs between the arrays of different dyes that are included in parallel&#8208;positioned nanochannels by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Dichromism and diattenuation of individual micro&#8208;sized crystals are dependent on their relative position under polarized light. This angular&#8208;dependent behavior is a result of the geometricallyconstrained orientation of the dyes by the crystallographic packing of the host matrix and is concentration dependent.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated and Efficient Generation of General Molecular Aggregate Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modeling intermolecular interactions of complex non&#8208;covalent structures is important in many areas of chemistry. To facilitate the generation of reasonable dimer, oligomer, and general aggregate geometries, we introduce an automated computational interaction site screening (aISS) workflow. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool combines a genetic algorithm employing the intermolecular force&#8208;field xTB&#8208;IFF for initial search steps with the general force&#8208;field GFN&#8208;FF and the semi&#8208;empirical GFN2&#8208;xTB method for geometry optimizations. Compared with the alternative CREST program, aISS yields similar results but with computer time savings of 1&#8208;3 orders of magnitude. This allows for the treatment of systems with thousands of atoms composed of elements up to radon, e.g., metalorganic complexes, or even polyhedra and zeolite cut&#8208;outs which were not accessible before. Moreover, aISS can identify reactive sites and provides options like site&#8208;directed (user&#8208;guided) screening.

         <title>Photocatalytic Deuterium Atom Transfer Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes with High Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its mild reaction conditions and unique chemoselectivity, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) hydrogenation represents an indispensable method for the synthesis of complex molecules. Its analog using deuterium, deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration, is expected to enable access to complex deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds. However, DAT deuteration has been scarcely studied for synthetic purposes, and a method that possesses the favorable characteristics of HAT hydrogenations has remained elusive. Herein, we report a protocol for the photocatalytic DAT deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. In contrast to the previous DAT deuteration, this method tolerates a variety of synthetically useful functional groups including haloarenes. The late&#8208;stage deuteration also allows access to deuterated amino acids as well as donepezil&#8208;d2. Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of DAT chemistry to become the alternative method of choice for preparing deuterium&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Apparent 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig Carbofluorination of Alkenes Enabled by Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversing the intrinsic cyclization mode. Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of Selectfluor 2 provides chromanes 3 with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation affords PdII intermediate A whose oxidation to PdIV followed by 1,2&#8208;aryl/PdIV dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination affords chromane 3.







Abstract
Alkene difunctionalization featuring an intramolecular carbometallation step has been developed into a powerful transformation in organic synthesis. The 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbometallation is in general highly favored over the alternative 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. We report herein a formal 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbofluorination protocol by combining the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation with a chemoselective 1,2&#8208;aryl/Pd dyotropic rearrangement. Treatment of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(dba)2, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and Selectfluor affords chromanes with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PdII species resulting from the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation process is isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Its oxidation to PdIV complex triggers the chemoselective dyotropic rearrangement leading to the ring expansion product.

         <title>Cu Single Atom Nanozyme Based High&#8208;Efficiency Mild Photothermal Therapy through Cellular Metabolic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu single atom nanozyme achieves mild photothermal cancer therapy by a two&#8208;pronged strategy, where the delivered clinical medicine licogliflozin closes a sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter valve for blocking the energy required for the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Meanwhile, the nanozyme forms a reactive oxygen species storm to damage existing HSPs.







Abstract
Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) drastically compromises the treatment effect of mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, we designed a polyporous Cu single atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) loaded with licogliflozin (LIK066) for HSP&#8208;silencing induced mild PTT. On one hand, LIK066 inhibits glucose uptake by shutting sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) &#8220;valve&#8221;, effectively blocking the energy source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. On the other hand, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two&#8208;pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066&#8208;loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.

         <dc:description>
Introducing a new super&#8208;bulky triamidoamine ligand to actinide chemistry has enabled the previously elusive terminal parent thorium&#8208;arsinidene linkage, that is the first terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene, to be synthesised and isolated. Quantum chemical calculations reveal a surprisingly large change to the Th=AsH linkage compared to an electrostatically&#8208;bound potassium&#8208;capped analogue.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of the terminal pnictidenes [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH)][M(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)] (TrenTCHS={N(CH2CH2NSiCy3)3}3&#8722;; An/Pn/M=Th/P/Na 5, Th/As/K 6, U/P/Na 7, U/As/K 8) and their conversion to the pnictides [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH2)] (An/Pn=Th/P 9, Th/As 10, U/P 11, U/As 12). Use of the super&#8208;bulky TrenTCHS ligand was essential to accessing complete families, and 6 is an unprecedented example of a terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene complex and only the second structurally authenticated parent terminal arsinidene complex of any metal. Comparison of the terminal Th=AsH unit of 6 to the bridging ThAs(H)K linkage in structurally analogous [Th(TrenTIPS){&#956;&#8208;As(H)K(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)}] (TrenTIPS={N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3}3&#8722;) reveals a stronger Th&#8722;As bond in the former compared to the latter, and a large response overall to the nature of the Th=AsH bonding upon removal of the electrostatically&#8208;bound K&#8208;ion; the &#963;&#8208;bond changes little but the &#960;&#8208;bond is significantly perturbed.

         <title>Photoinduced Promiscuity of Cyclohexanone Monooxygenase for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced reductive dehalogenation promiscuity of cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) with a novel mechanism of ET/PT distinct from the photoinduced promiscuity of natural reductases is reported. Various highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were synthesized by photoinduced reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones in a process catalyzed by the rationally designed CHMO mutants.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral fluorinated compounds has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a promiscuous cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) for the photoinduced synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones via enantioselective reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones. Wild&#8208;type CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. possesses this promiscuous ability innately; however, the yield and stereoselectivity are low. A structure&#8208;guided rational design of CHMO improved the yield and stereoselectivity remarkably. Mechanistic studies and molecular simulations demonstrated that this photoinduced CHMO catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation via a novel electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) mechanism, distinct from that of previously reported reductases with similar promiscuity. This methodology was expanded to various substrates, and desirable chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99:1).

         <title>Design of a Protein with Improved Thermal Stability by an Evolution&#8208;Based Generative Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein design bears great interest in both research and industry. Evolutionary&#8208;based methods have been promising in designing new sequences based on the concept that the evolutionary fitness of a sequence is closely related to folding stability. Here we present a computational pipeline that thanks to a combination of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;based methods can design new sequences translating in functional proteins with enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
Efficient design of functional proteins with higher thermal stability remains challenging especially for highly diverse sequence variants. Considering the evolutionary pressure on protein folds, sequence design optimizing evolutionary fitness could help designing folds with higher stability. Using a generative evolution fitness model trained to capture variation patterns in natural sequences, we designed artificial sequences of a proteinaceous inhibitor of pectin methylesterase enzymes. These inhibitors have considerable industrial interest to avoid phase separation in fruit juice manufacturing or reduce methanol in distillates, averting chromatographic passages triggering unwanted aroma loss. Six out of seven designs with up to 30&#8201;% divergence to other inhibitor sequences are functional and two have improved thermal stability. This method can improve protein stability expanding functional protein sequence space, with traits valuable for industrial applications and scientific research.

         <title>Modified Intramolecular&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy is presented for the construction of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, high photoluminescence quantum yield and large horizontal orientation factor, which enables to assemble non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy is an appealing task for designing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, but only limited examples have been reported so far. Herein we present a &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy to develop TADF emitters for improving the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The installation of an electron&#8208;deficient heptagonal diimide lock onto a highly rotatable biphenyl&#8208;based emitter not only enhances electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor that decreases singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), but also endows the skeleton with modest rigidity and flexibility that increases photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat film. In particular, the integration of the diimide lock also leads to an increase in horizontal orientation factor (&#920;//) from 69&#8201;% to 83&#8201;%. Consequently, this modified intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy enables an efficient TADF emitter to assemble high&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and a power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Nanoradiosensitizers Enhance Radiotherapy by Combining ROS Generation and CO Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional X&#8208;ray reactor, ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem, was developed to enhance radiotherapy by combining ROS generation and CO gas release. The well&#8208;designed nanostructures can increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). Furthermore, the coating of the targeting cell membrane improved this radiosensitizer with a certain degree of targeting and biocompatibility.







Abstract
A lack of targeting accuracy and radiosensitivity severely limits clinical radiotherapy. In this study, we developed a radiosensitizer comprised of Ru&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic nanostructures (ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem) to optimize irradiation by maximizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and CO release in X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced dynamic therapy (XDT). The well&#8208;designed nanostructures increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). The secondary electrons were trapped and transferred in the constrained MONs where they induce a cascade of reactions to increase the therapeutic efficiency. Meanwhile, the full&#8208;length antiglypican 3 (GPC3) antibody (hGC33) expressed a cell membrane coating enabling active targeting of tumor sites with optimized biocompatibility. The ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem represents a starting point for advancing an all&#8208;around radiosensitizer that operates efficiently in clinical XDT.

         <title>Unveiling the &#8220;Proton Lubricant&#8221; Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/PEDOT hybrid featuring enlarged interlayers (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm), good hydrophilicity and high electronic conductivity was prepared, demonstrating highly reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The co&#8208;inserted protons induced by PEDOT effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT and Zn2+, providing a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
Proton insertion chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is becoming a research hotspot owing to its fast kinetics and additional capacities. However, H+ storage mechanism has not been deciphered in the popular MoS2&#8208;based AZIBs. Herein, we innovatively prepared a MoS2/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (MoS2/PEDOT) hybrid, where the intercalated PEDOT not only increases the interlayer spacing (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm) and electronic conductivity of MoS2, but also activates the proton insertion chemistry. Thus, highly efficient and reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors are demonstrated for the first time in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. More intriguingly, the co&#8208;inserted protons can act as lubricants to effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT host and divalent Zn2+, enabling the accelerated ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics and exceptional rate performance. This work proposes a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; driving Zn2+ transport and broadens the horizons of Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries.

         <title>An Enzymatically Gated Catalytic Hairpin Assembly Delivered by Lipid Nanoparticles for the Tumor&#8208;Specific Activation of Signal Amplification in miRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid nanoparticles&#8208;mediated, enzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification strategy was proposed for precise miRNA imaging both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of switchable catalytic hairpin assembly with controlled in vivo delivery enables tumor&#8208;specific signal amplification with reduced off&#8208;tumor signal.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) imaging in disease sites is vital to elucidate their role in cancer progression. However, limited tumor specificity remains a major barrier for traditional amplification approaches due to associated background signal leakage. Here, we report a generalizable approach via the combination of enzymatically triggered catalytic hairpin assembly with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for tumor&#8208;specific activation of signal amplification and therefore sensitive miRNA imaging. The signal amplification is established via engineering of traditional catalytic hairpin assembly with enzymatically activated motifs to achieve triggable miRNA imaging in cancer cells. Furthermore, by the introduction of LNPs to combat biological barriers, we demonstrate that the system enables amplified miRNA imaging in vivo with reduced off&#8208;tumor signal, leading to enhanced tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background contrast compared with traditional methods. This approach that relies on specific triggers and controlled delivery to distinguish miRNA in cancer cells from normal cells should be useful in tumor diagnosis.

         <title>Electrifying Adipic Acid Production: Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidation and C&#8722;C Cleavage of Cyclohexanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate was achieved by incorporating copper into a nickel hydroxide electrode. Cu2+ plays a key role in weakening the interaction between the surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical and the NiOOH surface, thereby facilitating C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
Adipic acid is a central platform molecule for the polymer industry. Production of adipic acid with electroreforming technology is more sustainable compared to the thermochemical synthesis route. We discovered that incorporation of Cu2+ into a Ni hydroxide lattice significantly improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate with a high yield (84&#8201;%) and selectivity (87&#8201;%). This Cu promotion effect serves as a mechanistic probe that can be combined with product analysis, steady&#8208;state kinetics, and in situ spectroscopy. A two&#8208;electron oxidation into cyclohexanone first occurs, followed by consecutive hydroxylation and C&#8722;C cleavage before dione formation. The central role of Cu2+ is to weaken the interaction between the NiOOH and surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical that facilitates subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. This enables a highly efficient two&#8208;electrode system capable of electroreforming KA oil into adipate and pure H2.

         <title>{Mo126W30}: Polyoxometalate Cages Shaped by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resembling the stacked orientation of nucleobases in DNA, arrays of aromatic carboxylates provide multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in directing the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages. The interior aromatic units can be postsynthetically replaced by a selection of functionalized aliphatic dicarboxylates, offering options to fine&#8208;tune the microenvironment within the cage cavity.







Abstract
Here we report the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages templated by &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar ligands. Their inorganic shells incorporate arrays of 18 stacked aromatic carboxylates, such as 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate or 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate, and the assembly is stabilized by multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo&#8208;functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel(I) and Nickel(II) Bis&#8208;benzene Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+, hitherto unknown in the condensed phase, was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation exhibits an asymmetric slipped sandwich structure. Its magnetic properties were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Further oxidation with the Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2.







Abstract
A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+ hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically &#951;3,&#951;6&#8208;slipped sandwich structure. The magnetic properties of the [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Oxidation with the synergistic Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2. All products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

&lt;p&gt;A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[WCA]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and benzene ([WCA]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=[F{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically &#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-slipped sandwich structure. The magnetic properties of the [Ni(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Oxidation with the synergistic Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/0.5&#8197;l&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system led to the salt [Ni(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;([WCA]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. All products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Tellurium&#8208;Based Chalcogen Bonding: Photocontrolled Anion Binding and Anion Abstraction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new noncovalent bonding motifs with reversibly tunable binding affinity is of fundamental importance in manipulating the properties and functions of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly systems and materials. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a unique visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazole/triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding (ChB) system in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The binding strengths between these azo&#8208;derived ChB receptors and the halide anions (Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;) could be reversibly regulated upon irradiation by different visible lights. The cis&#8208;bidentate ChB receptors can exhibit enhanced halide anion binding abilities comparing to the trans&#8208;monodentate ones. Particularly, the telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based ChB receptor can achieve both high and significantly photoswitchable binding affinities for halide anions, which enable it to serve as an efficient photocontrolled organocatalyst for the ChB assisted halide&#160;abstraction&#160;in a Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation benchmark reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of Electrochemically Active Conjugated Organic Molecules and Its Impact on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecule aggregation in solution is acknowledged to be universal and can regulate the molecule's physiochemical properties, which however has been rarely investigated in electrochemistry. Herein, an electrochemical method is developed to quantitatively study the aggregation behavior of the target molecule methyl viologen dichloride. It is found that the oxidation state dicationic ions stay discrete, while the singly&#8208;reduced state monoradicals yield a concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation behavior. As a result, the molecule's energy level and its redox potential can be effectively regulated. This work does not only provide a method to investigate the molecular aggregation, but also demonstrates the feasibility to tune redox flow battery's performance by regulating the aggregation behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>(SCp)Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura Reaction for Buildingup Axial Chirality: Counteranion&#8208;Directed Switching of Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction is an important method for extending &#960;&#8208;systems by forging multi&#8208;substituted benzene rings via double aryl C&#8211;H activation and annulation with alkynes. However, the development of highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction remains rather challenging. Herein, we report an asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction between 1&#8208;aryl benzo[h]isoquinolines and internal alkynes enabled by a SCpRh&#8208;catalyst. Judiciously choosing the counteranion of the Rh&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the desired reactivity over the competitive formation of azoniahelicenes. Detailed mechanistic studies support the proposal of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of reaction pathways in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Charge Transfer Limitations for Extreme Fast Charging of Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extreme fast charging (XFC) of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is a key enabler of electrified transportation. While previous studies mainly focused on improving Li ion mass transport in electrodes and electrolytes, the limitations of charge transfer across electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces remain underexplored. Here we unravel how charge transfer kinetics dictates the fast rechargeability of Li&#8208;ion cells. Li ion transfer across the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is found to be rate&#8208;limiting during XFC, but the charge transfer energy barrier at both the cathode and anode have to be reduced simultaneously to prevent Li plating, which is made possible by tuning the type of Li salts and solvents. By unlocking charge transfer limitations, we show that 184 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells realize stable XFC (10&#8208;min charge to 80%) which is otherwise unachievable, and that the lifetime of 245 Wh kg&#8722;1 21700 cells is quintupled during fast charging (25&#8208;min charge to 80%), outperforming commercial technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Monosaccharide Channels: Size&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport of Glucose and Fructose Mediated by Porphyrin Boxes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report synthetic monosaccharide channels built with shape&#8208;persistent organic cages, porphyrin boxes (  PB  s), that allow facile transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose through their windows.  PB  s show a much higher transport rate for glucose and fructose over disaccharides such as sucrose, as evidenced by intravesicular enzyme assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The transport rate can be modulated by changing the length of the alkyl chains decorating the cage windows. Insertion of a linear pillar ligand into the cavity of  PB  s blocks the monosaccharide transport. In&#8208;vitro cell experiment shows that  PB  s transport glucose across the living cell membrane and enhance cell viability when natural glucose transporter GLUT1 is blocked. Time&#8208;dependent live&#8208;cell imaging and MTT assay confirm the cyto&#8208;compatibility of  PB  s. Monosaccharide selective transport ability of  PB  s is reminiscent of natural glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are crucial for numerous biological functions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a direct, metal&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as the economic and abundant carboxylic source was reported. The electrocarboxylation was carried out in an operationally simple manner with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, setting the stage for the challenging site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated (hetero)arenes. The robust nature of the electrochemical strategy was reflected by a broad scope of substrates with excellent atom economy and unique selectivity. Notably, the direct and selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of various challenging arenes worked well in this approach, including electron&#8208;deficient naphthalenes, pyridines, simple phenyl derivatives, and substituted quinolines. The method benefits from being externally catalyst&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free, which makes it extremely attractive for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaarenes: 13 Rings in a Row by Cyclopentannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentannulation was explored as a strategy to access large, stable azaarenes. Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of previously reported di&#8208; and tetrabrominated cyclopentannulated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacenes furnished stable azaarenes with up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row and a length of 3.1 nm. The optoelectronic, semi&#8208;conducting properties as well as their aromaticity were investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of Na+ within a {Mg2Na2} Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic compounds containing sodium cations are notable for their stability and resistance to redox reactivity unless highly reducing electrical potentials are applied. Here we report that treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg  2  Na  2  } species with non&#8208;reducible organic bases induces the spontaneous and completely selective extrusion of sodium metal and oxidation of the Mg(I) centers to the more conventional Mg(II) state. Although these processes are also characterized by a structural reorganisation of the initially chelated diamide spectator ligand, computational quantum chemical studies indicate that intramolecular electron transfer is abetted by the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) of the {Mg  2  Na  2  } ensemble, which arise exclusively from the 3  s  valence atomic orbitals of the constituent sodium and magnesium atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Modulation of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activities of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts through p&#8211;n Junction Rectification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fine&#8208;tuning single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to surpass their activity limit remains challenging at such an atomic scale. Herein, we exploit p&#8208;type semiconducting character of the SACs having metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors (MeN x ) and rectify their local charge density by an n&#8208;type semiconductor support. With iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as model SAC, introducing an n&#8208;type gallium monosulfide that features low work function generates a space&#8208;charged region across the junction interface, and causes distortion of the FeN4 moiety and spin state transition in the Fe(II) center. This catalyst shows an over two&#8208;fold higher specific oxygen&#8208;reduction activity than that of pristine FePc. We further employ other three n&#8208;type metal chalcogenides of varying work function as support, and discover a linear correlation between the activities of the supported FeN4 and the rectification degrees, which clearly indicates that SACs can be continuously tuned by this rectification strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 Bonds Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters by Synergistic Palladium and Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for stereodivergent formation of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bonds bearing vicinal stereocenters. Despite the many successes that have been achieved in this field, stereodivergent Csp3&#8211;Csp3 coupling reactions involving stabilized nucleophiles remain challenging because of the competing single&#8208;catalysis pathway. Herein, we report a synergistic palladium/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst system that enables diastereodivergent Csp3&#8211;Csp3 coupling reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes with stabilized nucleophile oxindoles. Both the syn and anti coupling products, bearing quaternary and tertiary vicinal stereocenters, could be selectively produced in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Non&#8208;covalent activation of the stabilized nucleophile via chiral ion pair in a biphasic system is a crucial success factor in achieving diastereodivergence.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrolyte Design for Rechargeable Batteries: From Lithium to Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg&#8208;ion and the popular Li&#8208;ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intension of accelerating the development of sustainable and high&#8208;performance battery technologies.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tight Host&#8208;Guest Binding with Exceptionally Strong Positive Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexation of DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests with a rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle exhibits remarkably high binding affinities with positive cooperativity that is among the strongest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The ultra&#8208;tight binding and extraordinary positive cooperativity are driven by size/shape host&#8211;guest matching, guest&#8208;activated stacking of macrocycles, and multiple charge&#8208;dipole and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.







Abstract
Cooperativity plays a critical role in self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition. A rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle with a cyclodirectional backbone binds with DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in high affinities (Ktotal &#8776;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2) in the highly polar DMF. The host&#8211;guest binding also exhibits exceptionally strong positive cooperativity quantified by interaction factors &#945; that are among the largest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The unusually strong positive cooperativity, revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fully corroborated by mass spectrometry, NMR and computational studies, is driven by guest&#8208;induced stacking of the macrocycles and stabilization from the alkyl end chains of the guests, interactions that appear upon binding the second macrocycle. With its tight binding driven by extraordinary positive cooperativity, this host&#8211;guest system provides a tunable platform for studying molecular interactions and for constructing stable supramolecular assemblies.

With the use of simple triarylphosphine as a co-catalyst, three cyanation reactions, including di-hydrocyanation, &lt;i&gt;anti-&lt;/i&gt;Markovnikov hydrocyanation, and domino hydrocyanation/reduction, can be divergently achieved, furnishing a wide array of alkyl dinitriles, alkenyl nitriles, and alkyl nitriles under mild conditions. Terminal and internal alkynes are applicable with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. Synthetic applications for biologically active agents and preliminary experimental and computational mechanistic studies are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Liquids Responsive to Light
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) with permanent cavities is formed by dissolving Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) in bulky ionic liquid .The MOP carries azobenzene moieties as pendant groups which undergo trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomerization under visible and UV light irradiation and thus, a controlled CO2 uptake and release is realized.







Abstract
A porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines the cavity of porous solids with the fluidity of liquids. This special characteristic offers potential in various applications. Here we report a type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) from dissolving a photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in a polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiation. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30&#8201;% compared to neat IL. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.

         <title>Facet&#8208;specific Active Surface Regulation of BixMOy (M=Mo, V, W) Nanosheets for Boosted Photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports (010) specific surface&#8208;regulated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The modified surface exhibits boosted CO2 photoreduction because of increased activation/adsorption of CO2 molecules. A combination of advanced characterizations and theoretical simulation confirmed performance and mechanism.







Abstract
Photocatalytic performance can be optimized via introduction of reactive sites. However, it is practically difficult to engineer these on specific photocatalyst surfaces, because of limited understanding of atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity. Here we report a facile sonication&#8208;assisted chemical reduction for specific facets regulation via oxygen deprivation on Bi&#8208;based photocatalysts. The modified Bi2MoO6 nanosheets exhibit 61.5 and 12.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO and CH4 production respectively, &#8776;3 times greater than for pristine catalyst, together with excellent stability/reproducibility of &#8776;20&#8197;h. By combining advanced characterizations and simulation, we confirm the reaction mechanism on surface&#8208;regulated photocatalysts, namely, induced defects on highly&#8208;active surface accelerate charge separation/transfer and lower the energy barrier for surface CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction. Promisingly, this method appears generalizable to a wider range of materials.

         <title>Correlation between Electrolyte Chemistry and Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Reversible Ca Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unravel the unique electrolyte chemistry in Ca metal anodes to tailor the solid electrolyte interphases characteristics, leading to the design of several promising electrolyte formulations for the reversible Ca deposition/stripping under a commercially available salt calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. In particular, 1&#8208;methylimidazole (MeIm)&#8208; and dimethylacetamide (DMAc)&#8208; based electrolytes allow stable cycling with low overpotentials.







Abstract
The development of rechargeable Ca metal batteries (RCMBs) is hindered by the Ca2+ passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation&#8208;solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion&#8208;derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation&#8208;solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly&#8208;solvating solvent and highly&#8208;dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent&#8208;occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic&#8208;rich/CaF2&#8208;poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.

         <title>Coordination Switch Drives Selective C&#8722;S Bond Formation by the Non&#8208;Heme Sulfoxide Synthases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations suggest that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of ergothioneine synthase (EgtB). This coordination switch from S to O is driven by the S/&#960; nonbonding electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation.







Abstract
The non&#8208;heme iron ergothioneine synthase (EgtB) is a sulfoxide synthase that catalyzes oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the synthesis of ergothioneine, which plays roles against oxidative stress in cells. Despite extensive experimental and computational studies of the catalytic mechanisms of EgtB, the root causes for the selective C&#8722;S bond formation remain elusive. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we show herein that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of the non&#8208;heme iron EgtB. This coordination switch from the S to the O atom is driven by the S/&#960; electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation. The present mechanism is in agreement with all available experimental data, including regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and KIE results. This match underscores the critical role of coordination switching in the catalysis of non&#8208;heme enzymes.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Kinetic States of a [2]Rotaxane&#8208;Based Molecular Shuttle Controlled by Acid Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle has been synthesized. The shuttling kinetics can be controlled by the acid concentration and the kinetic intermediate can even be captured at a high concentration of acid. This was explained by invoking different protonation states of the rotaxane at different concentrations of acid.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle is reported. Upon adding TFA, the macrocycle, namely the amine naphthotube, is protonated and translocates from the di(quaternary ammonium) station to the triazole stations because of electrostatic repulsion and weakened binding. The shuttling kinetics are slow due to the steric hindrance caused by the ethyl group on the quaternary ammonium center and can be followed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, it was found that the shuttling kinetics depends on the concentration of TFA. A kinetic intermediate was detected and can even be captured in the presence of a high concentration of TFA. Extensive control experiments revealed that the shuttling kinetics and the capture of the kinetic intermediate are related to the different protonation states of the rotaxanes.

         <title>Triflylpyridinium Enables Rapid and Scalable Controlled Reduction of Carboxylic Acids to Aldehydes using Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building up new and efficient method for the controlled conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes is important. Herein, we report a rapid, modular and scalable method for the conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes using pinacolborane at ambient temperature, in which a triflylpyridinium reagent is used. The conversion of carboxylic acid to intermediate acylpyridinium by triflylpyridinium is new. A binary pyridine&#8208;coordinated boronium complex is generated after reduction. The unprecedented reduction of the acylpyridinium by HBpin opens up a practically direct synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids. Theoretical studies indicate that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of the product aldehyde. The synthetic advantage of this protocol is further highlighted by the scalable synthesis of aldehyde via continuous flow process.&#160;Configuration retention for chiral acids are presented in those syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Supramolecular H&#8208;bonding Network with Orthogonally Tunable Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enabling dynamically tunable emissive systems offers opportunities for constructing smart materials. Clusteroluminescence, as unconventional luminescence, has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental and applied sciences. Herein, we report a supramolecular poly(disulfides) network with tunable clusteroluminescence. The reticular H&#8208;bonds synergize the rigidity and mobility of dynamic networks, and endow the resulting materials with mechanical adaptivity and robustness, simultaneously enabling efficient clusteroluminescence and phosphorescence at 77 K. Orthogonally tunable luminescence are achieved in two manners, i.e., slow backbone disulfide exchange and fast side&#8208;chain metal coordination. Further exploration of the reprocessability and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of intrinsic dynamic networks for sustainable materials is feasible. We foresee that the synergistic strategy of dynamic chemistry offers a novel pathway and potential opportunities for smart emissive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Compatible Phototrophic Community for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 sequestration engineering is promising for carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis, and the artificial communities can solve more complex problems than monocultures. However, obtaining an ideal photosynthetic community is still a great challenging. Here, we developed a highly&#8208;compatible photosynthetic community (HCPC) by integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. The cyanobacteria CO2 sequestration module was obtained using stepwise metabolic engineering and then coupled with the efficient sucrose utilization module, Vibrio natriegens. Integrated omics analysis indicated enhanced photosynthetic electron transport and extracellular vesicles promote intercellular communication. Additionally, the HCPC was used to channel CO2 into valuable chemicals, enabling an overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59 kgCO2e/kg in the end products. This novel light&#8208;driven community could facilitate circular economic implementation in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters via Remote H&#8208;Bonding Stereoinduction in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening transformations of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes enable the rapid assembly of complex molecules. However, the enantioselective formation of chiral quaternary stereocenters using substrates bearing two different acceptors remains a challenge. Herein, we describe the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition of vinyl cyclopropanes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, a subset of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through hydrogen bond from chiral ligands, which thereby addressed the aforementioned challenge. A variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocycles were produced in good yields and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99% yields, 99:1 er and &gt;19:1 dr). In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and theoretical calculations, revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity and the importance of H&#8208;bonding in stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>An Infectious Virus&#8208;like Particle Built on a Programmable Icosahedral DNA Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viral genomes can be compressed into a near&#8208;spherical nanochamber to form infectious particles. In order to mimic the virus morphology and packaging behavior, we invented a programmable icosahedral DNA nanoframe with enhanced rigidity and encapsulated the phiX174 bacteriophage genome. The packaging efficiency could be modulated through specific anchoring strands adjustment, and the trapped phage genome remained the accessibility for enzymatic operations. Moreover, the packed complex could infect Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells through bacterial uptake then produce plaques. This rigid icosahedral DNA architecture demonstrated a versatile platform to develop virus mimetic particles for convenient functional nucleic acid entrapment, manipulation and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical applications of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size&#8208;controlled synthesis of low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128 cm&#8208;1. KPb2Cl5 nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb2X5 nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche&#8208;like emission from KPb2Cl5:Nd3+ nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra&#8208;low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon&#8208;dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Pore&#8208;Structure Engineering by Ligand Conformational Control of Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymers for Efficient Chemiresistive Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with tunable structure and conductivity is attractive but remains challenging. Herein, fine pore structure engineering by ligand conformation control of naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based semiconducting PCPs with &#960; stacking&#8208;dependent conductivity tunability was achieved. The &#960; stacking distances and ligand conformation in these isoreticular PCPs were modulated by altering the metal center with different coordination geometry. As a result, three conjugated PCPs (Co&#8208;pyNDI, Ni&#8208;pyNDI, and Zn&#8208;pyNDI) with varying pore structure and conductivity were obtained, whose crystal structures were determined by the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction technique. The through&#8208;space charge transfer and tunable pore structure in these PCPs endow modulated selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresitive sensor selective to acetone.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution Strategy for the Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Streptonigrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that axially chiral biaryl boronic esters can be generated with control of atropselectivity by a Binol&#8208;mediated dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. These intermediates can be progressed to enantioenriched products via stereoretentive functionalization of the carbon&#8208;boron bond. Finally, we have exploited this method in the first highly stereoselective total synthesis of  P  streptonigrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Structure and Dynamics Landscape of Proteins in Mammalian Cells Revealed by In&#8208;Cell NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Governing function, half life and subcellular localization, the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins are in nature constantly changing in a tightly regulated manner to fulfill the physiological and adaptive requirements of the cells. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we applied in&#8208;cell NMR to three folded model proteins and propose that the splitting of cross peaks constitutes an atomic fingerprint of distinct structural states that arise from multiple target binding co&#8208;existing inside mammalian cells. These structural states change upon protein loss of function or subcellular localisation into distinct cell compartments. In addition to peak splitting, we observed NMR signal intensity attenuations indicative of transient interactions with other molecules and dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR and DFT Studies with a Doubly Labelled 15N/6Li S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Reveal Why a Directed ortho&#8208;Lithiation Requires an Excess of n&#8208;BuLi.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work shows why it is imperious to use an excess of butyllithium for a directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of a trifluoromethyl sulfoximine. The analysis of mixtures of n&#8208;BuLi and sulfoximine 1 in THF&#8208;d8 using {1H, 6Li, 13C, 15N, 19F} NMR experiments at low temperatures reveal that a first deprotonation occurs that leads to dimeric and tetrameric N&#8208;lithiated sulfoximine (93:7). Using an excess n&#8208;BuLi (5 equivalents), the second deprotonation on the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic occurs. Six species were observed and characterized on the way. It includes three aggregates involving a sulfoximine: i) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)] dimer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg2, 39%); ii) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)3] tetramer solvated by six molecules of THF (Agg3, 39%); iii) a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuOLi)3] tetramer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg1, 22%). A DFT study afforded optimized solvated structures for all these aggregates, fully consistent with the NMR data.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence of Sulfur Non&#8208;Innocence in [CoII(dithiacyclam)]2+&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In many metalloenzymes sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8722;ligation in cobalt mediated Oxygen Reduction Reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (cyclam = 1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) (1) and the S&#8722;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (S2N2&#8208;cyclam = 1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane, (2) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the Co(II) centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Double perovskites (DPs) are one of the most promising candidates for developing white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) owing to their intrinsic broadband emission from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Translation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DPs to one&#8208;dimensional (1D) analogues, which could break the octahedral tolerance factor limit, is so far remaining unexplored. Herein, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a series of highly luminescent 1D DP&#8208;inspired materials, (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD = 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI = K+ and Rb+). Highly efficient warm&#8208;white photoluminescence quantum yield of 92 % is achieved by doping 0.3% Sb3+ in (DFPD)2KInBr6. Furthermore, single&#8208;component warm&#8208;WLEDs fabricated with (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb&#160;yield a luminance of 300 cd/m2, which is one of the best&#8208;performing lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halides WLEDs reported so far. Our study expands the scope of In&#8208;based metal&#8208;halides from 3D to 1D, which exhibit superior optical performances and broad application prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Shuttle&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Cu&#8211;Li Battery based on a Sandwich&#8208;Structured Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;Li batteries leveraging the two&#8208;electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8208;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte for solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li batteries, in which a deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gel with high Cu&#8208;ion solubility is devised as a Cu&#8208;ion reservoir while a ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 interlayer is used to block Cu&#8208;ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55 mS.cm&#8208;1 at 25 oC), wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.5 V vs. Li+/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte, a solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1,485 Wh kgCu&#8208;1and long&#8208;term cyclability with 97% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state Cu&#8208;Li batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Precise Antitumoral Photodynamic Therapy Using a Dual Receptor&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Activation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted delivery and specific activation of photosensitizers can greatly improve the treatment outcome of photodynamic therapy. To this end, we report herein a novel dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach to enhance the tumor specificity of the photodynamic action. It involves the targeted delivery of a biotinylated boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer, which is quenched in the native form by the attached 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine unit, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide conjugated with a bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne moiety. Only for cancer cells that overexpress both the biotin receptor and EGFR, the two components can be internalized preferentially where they undergo an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, leading to restoration of the photodynamic activity of the BODIPY core.

To this end, we report herein a novel dual receptor-mediated bioorthogonal activation approach to enhance the tumor specificity of the photodynamic action. It involves the targeted delivery of a biotinylated boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based photosensitizer, which is quenched in the native form by the attached 1,2,4,5-tetrazine unit, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting cyclic peptide conjugated with a bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-yne moiety. Only for cancer cells that overexpress both the biotin receptor and EGFR, the two components can be internalized preferentially where they undergo an inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction, leading to restoration of the photodynamic activity of the BODIPY core. By using a range of cell lines with different expression levels of these two receptors, we have demonstrated that this stepwise &#8220;deliver-and-click&#8221; approach can confine the photodynamic action on a specific type of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Economical Access to Diverse Enantiopure Tetrahydropyridines and Piperidines Enabled by Catalytic Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a catalytic borrowing hydrogen method that enables an unprecedented, economical one&#8208;pot access to enantiopure tetrahydropyridines with minimal reagent use or waste formation. This method couples a few classes of readily available substrates with commercially available 1,3&#8208;amino alcohols, and delivers the valuable tetrahydropyridines of different substitution patterns free of  N  &#8208;protection. Such transformations are highly challenging to achieve, as multiple redox steps need to be realized in a cascade and numerous side reactions including a facile aromatization have to be overcome. Highly diastereoselective functionalizations of tetrahydropyridines also result in a general access to enantiopure di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted piperidines, which ranks the topmost frequent  N  &#8208;heterocycle in commercial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Laser Emission from Homochiral Superstructures based on Achiral Molecules with Conformal Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without external chiral intervention, it is a challenge to form homochirality from achiral molecules with conformational flexibility. We here report on a rational strategy that uses multivalent noncovalent interactions to clamp the molecular conformational of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. These interactions overcome the otherwise dominant dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and thus disfavor their symmetric antiparallel stacking. It in turn facilitates parallel packing, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization and thus the formation of homochiral conglomerates. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with optical gain characteristics of the molecules, the homochiral crystals are explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4 &#956;J/cm2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9). This study therefore provides a facile design strategy for supramolecular chiral materials and active laser ones without the necessity of intrinsic chiral element.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Asymmetric 1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition via Palladium Hydride&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronically matched nucleophilic 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition has been well studied and widely applied in synthetic areas. In contrast, nucleophilic 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition represents an electronically forbidden process and is considered unfeasible. Here, we describe modular protocols for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reactions via palladium hydride catalysis. Both palladium and synergistic Pd/organocatalyst systems are developed to catalyze 1,5&#8208;conjugate reaction, followed by inter&#8208; or intramolecular [3+2] cyclization. A migratory 1,5&#8208;addition protocol is established to corroborate the feasibility of this umpolung concept. The 1,5&#8208;addition products are conveniently transformed into a series of privileged enantioenriched motifs, including polysubstituted tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, azetidine, oxetane, thietane, spirocycle and bridged rings. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborate the involvement of palladium hydride catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membrane with Penetrating Subnanochannels: A Versatile Nanofluidic Platform for Selective Metal Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels penetrated through cell membrane form unique transport pathways for selective ionic conductance. Replicating the success of ion selectivity with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) will enable new separation technologies but remains challenging. Herein, we report a soft substrate&#8208;assisted solution casting method to develop MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels for selective metal ion conduction. The MMMs are composed of penetrating Prussian white (PW) microcubes with subnanochannels in dense polyimide (PI) matrices, achieving selective monovalent metal ion conduction. The ion selectivity of K+/Mg2+ is up to 14.0, and the ion conductance of K+ can reach 45.5 &#181;S with the testing diameter of 5 mm, which can be further improved by increasing the testing area. Given the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrices, we expect that the MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform for various emerging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Block Poly(carbonate&#8208;ester) Ionomers as High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;esters) were designed that undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization in the polycarbonate rubbery mid&#8208;segment and are reinforced by reversible ionic interactions in the outer semi&#8208;aromatic polyester blocks. The thermoplastic elastomers show impressive tensile strength, high elastic recovery and are degradable in aqueous alkali media or chemically recyclable to monomer.







Abstract
Thermoplastic elastomers based on polyesters/carbonates have the potential to maximize recyclability, degradability and renewable resource use. However, they often underperform and suffer from the familiar trade&#8208;off between strength and extensibility. Herein, we report well&#8208;defined reprocessable poly(ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester) elastomers with impressive tensile strengths (60&#8197;MPa), elasticity (&gt;800&#8201;%) and recovery (95&#8201;%). Plus, the ester/carbonate linkages are fully degradable and enable chemical recycling. The superior performances are attributed to three features: (1)&#8197;Highly entangled soft segments; (2)&#8197;Fully reversible strain&#8208;induced crystallization and (3)&#8197;Precisely placed ZnII&#8208;carboxylates dynamically crosslinking the hard domains. The one&#8208;pot synthesis couples controlled cyclic monomer ring&#8208;opening polymerization and alternating epoxide/anhydride ring&#8208;opening copolymerization. Efficient convresion to ionomers is achieved by reacting vinyl&#8208;epoxides to install ZnII&#8208;carboxylates.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cleavage of C&#8722;P Bond: Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomers Containing a P&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>

         <dc:description>
Here we report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of a C&#8722;P bond for the construction of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The products are isolated in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 98&#8201;% ee). One of the isolated products is shown to catalyze the [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, thus demonstrating the utility of the present methodology.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful tool for the formation of both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bond. However, the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond is still undeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond for the construction of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines and stereogenic axis. This protocol enables the quick synthesis of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center in high yields, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. The product is able to serve as chiral catalyst in phosphine catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, showing the great potential of the present methodology.

&lt;p&gt;The transition-metal-catalyzed C&#8722;P bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful tool for the formation of both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bond. However, the transition-metal-catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond is still undeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium-catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond for the construction of P-stereogenic phosphines and stereogenic axis. This protocol enables the quick synthesis of atropisomers bearing a P-stereogenic center in high yields, diastereo- and enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, &amp;gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. The product is able to serve as chiral catalyst in phosphine catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, showing the great potential of the present methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the rare&#8208;earth nitride complexes enable highly efficient ammonia synthesis, they suffer from chemical sensitivity to air and moisture. Using Al&#8208;doped LaN as the model material, we show the impact of La&#8722;Al metallic bond formation on improving the catalysts&#8217; durability under air and moisture without affecting original functionalities.







Abstract
Metal nitride complexes have recently been proposed as an efficient noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for ammonia synthesis utilizing a dual active site concept. However, their high sensitivity to air and moisture has restricted potential applications. We report that their chemical sensitivity can be improved by introducing Al into the LaN lattice, thereby forming La&#8722;Al metallic bonds (La&#8722;Al&#8722;N). The catalytic activity and mechanism of the resulting TM/La&#8722;Al&#8722;N (TM=Ni, Co) are comparable to the previously reported TM/LaN catalyst. Notably, the catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture. Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La&#8722;Al&#8722;N is responsible for N2 absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of the lattice N remained largely unchanged. These findings show the effectiveness of metallic bond formation, which can support the chemical stability of rare&#8208;earth nitrides with retention of catalytic functionality.

         <title>Design of Co&#8208;Cu Diatomic Site Catalysts for High&#8208;efficiency Synergistic CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomic site catalyst consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is designed via a general and facile method. Industrial&#8208;level current density can be easily achieved in a flow cell system with the maximum CO partial current density up to 483&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CO selectivity can be maintained above 95&#8201;% over a wide current density range from 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in the field of CO2 electroreduction, but industrial&#8208;level current density and near&#8208;unity product selectivity are still difficult to achieve. Herein, a diatomic site catalysts (DASCs) consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is synthesized. The CoCu DASC exhibits excellent selectivity with the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;%. The CO selectivity can maintain above 95&#8201;% over a wide current density range from 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The maximum CO partial current density can reach to 483&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, far exceed industrial&#8208;level current density requirements (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Theoretical calculation reveals that the synergistic catalysis of the Co&#8208;Cu bimetallic sites reduce the activation energy and promote the formation of intermediate *COOH. This work shows that the introduction of another metal atom into SACs can significantly affect the electronic structure and then enhance the catalytic activity of SACs.

         <dc:description>
A rhodium/Malphos catalytic recipe has been developed for the dynamic kinetic intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. The desired cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products were obtained with decent yields and excellent stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Its dynamic kinetic nature has been confirmed by careful mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes afforded cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products with an excellent chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantio&#8208;selectivity. Many synthetically useful functional groups are tolerated. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated. Based on the careful experimental studies, a mechanism involving the rapid racemization of the allene moiety in the starting materials has been proposed.

A chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes is developed to prepare synthetically versatile 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through sequential 1,2&#8208;diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a copper catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). A wide range of terminal alkynes undergo this multi&#8208;borylation reaction to afford the corresponding 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes in high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential double 1,2&#8208;diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates. This protocol represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approach to prepare sp3&#8208;tetra&#8208;organometallic reagents from readily accessible alkynes with commercially available copper catalysts.

         <title>A LRET Nanoplatform Consisting of Lanthanide and Amorphous Manganese Oxide for NIR&#8208;II Luminescence Lifetime Imaging of Tumor Redox Status</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime regulation strategy was developed based on the energy transfer from lanthanide to amorphous manganese oxide. The redox status of cells and tumors was quantitatively visualized through NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Designing luminescence lifetime sensors in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window is a great challenge due to the difficult structural construction. Here, we report a tumor redox responsive and easily synthesized material, amorphous manganese oxide (MnOx) with indirect band gap of 1.02&#8197;eV, as an energy acceptor to build a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) toolbox for universally regulating NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide nanoparticles, in which energy transfer is based on matched energy gap instead of conventional overlapped spectra. We further utilize ytterbium (Yb3+)&#8208;doped YbNP@MnOx as an NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime sensor to realize in vitro quantitative redox visualization with relative errors under 5&#8201;% in samples covered with mouse skin. Furthermore, HepG2 cells and tumors with high redox state have been accurately distinguished by NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging. The quantified intracellular and intratumor glutathione (GSH) levels are highly consistent with the commercial kit results, illustrating the reliable redox visualization ability in biological tissue.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides having a Domain Structure
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined heparan sulfate mimetics having a domain structure were synthesized by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition of HS oligosaccharide having a terminal alkyne or azide moiety. Competition binding experiments demonstrated that the length of NA domains modulates the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) has a domain structure in which regions that are modified by epimerization and sulfonation (NS domains) are interspersed by unmodified fragments (NA domains). There is data to support that domain organization of HS can regulate binding of proteins, however, such model has been difficult to probe. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide HS oligosaccharides composed of two or more NS domains separated by NA domains of different length. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a HS oligosaccharide that enzymatically was extended by various GlcA&#8208;GlcNAc units and terminated in GlcNAc having an azido moiety at C&#8208;6 position. HS oligosaccharides having an azide and alkyne moiety could be assembled by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to give compounds having various NS domains separated by unsulfonated regions. Competition binding studies showed that the length of an NA domain modulates the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.

         <title>Regulating Exposed Facets of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;rate Alkaline Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>

Crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed for the design of MOF&#8208;based electrodes with higher capacity and faster electrochemical kinetics. The dominating exposed facets of PFC&#8208;8 can be regulated by a thermally&#8208;modified strategy, which delivers stronger OH&#8722; adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn growing attention as promising electrode candidates for rechargeable batteries. However, most studies focus on the direct use of MOF electrodes without any modification. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, a judicious tool to modify targeted properties of MOFs, has been long&#8208;neglected in the field of batteries. Herein, crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed to design MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high capacity and fast electrochemical kinetics. We found that a thermally&#8208;modified strategy can regulate the dominant exposed facet of Ni&#8208;based MOF (PFC&#8208;8). With the optimally exposed facets, the battery exhibited admirable rate capability (139.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 110.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that stronger OH&#8722; adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures induced by the regulated exposed facets boost the electrochemical performance.

         <title>Localized Lattice Expansion of FAPbBr3 to Design a 3D Hybrid Perovskite for Sensitive Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>

A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13 is tailored through the localized lattice expansion of 3D FAPbBr3. The resulting perovskite shows a high two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient of 60.8&#8197;cm&#8201;MW&#8722;1 and exhibits a sensitive near&#8208;infrared photoresponse with large on/off ratio (&#8776;104) and favorable stability.







Abstract
A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13 (1, NMDAP2+ = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diaminopropanium, FA+ = formamidinium) is tailored by incorporating the large NMDAP2+ cation with the small FA+ ion into 3D FAPbBr3. Structurally, the small FA+ ions occupy the prototypical cavities formed by distorted corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6 octahedra as in FAPbBr3, while the bulky NMDAP2+ ions are confined to the expanded lattice which is defined by a new structural motif composed of eight corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6 octahedra and four edge&#8208;sharing octahedra. This localized lattice expansion from FAPbBr3 creates a new branch of the intriguing 3D hybrid perovskite family, breaking the limits of the conventional Goldschmidt tolerance factor rule. Moreover, a high two&#8208;photon absorption (2AP) coefficient of 60.8&#8197;cm&#8201;MW&#8722;1 was demonstrated to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) 800&#8197;nm illumination, enabling sensitive NIR photoresponses with large on/off ratio (&#8776;104) as well as favorable stability.

Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. A remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed in aryne 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization.







Abstract
Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. These transformations could directly incorporate a C&#8722;N and a C&#8722;C bond para to each other on an aryne intermediate via a sequential nucleophilic addition and [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. When arynes bearing 3&#8208;tethered electrophiles were employed, a cascade regioselective nucleophilic addition, intramolecular cyclization, and remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between two C&#8722;H hydrogens on the penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl chain and the oxygen anion generated upon N&#8208;nucleophilic annulation reaction in the [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement step is responsible for the remote diastereoselective control in this reaction system.

Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hydrogen-bonding interactions between two C&#8722;H hydrogens on the penta-2,4-dien-1-yl chain and the oxygen anion generated upon N-nucleophilic annulation reaction in the [5,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement step is responsible for the remote diastereoselective control in this reaction system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Germapyramidane Switches Between 3D Cluster and 2D Cyclic Structures in Single&#8208;Electron Steps</title>

The mutual redox&#8208;isomerisation of a cationic nido&#8208;germapyramidane into a planar aromatic germole&#8208;diide is reported. The mechanism was elucidated using electrochemical and theoretical studies.







Abstract
Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;substituted iphosphate&#8208;diide, (Ipr)2C2P2 (IDP), with GeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane and KBArF24 [(BarF24)&#8722;=tetrakis[(3,5&#8208;trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate)] afforded the dicationic spherical&#8208;aromatic nido&#8208;cluster [Ge(&#951;4&#8208;IDP)]2+ ([1]2+) (Ipr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). This complex is a rare heavy analogue of the elusive pyramidane [C(&#951;4&#8208;C4H4)]. [1]2+ undergoes two reversible one&#8208;electron reductions, which yield the radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and the neutral GeII species 3. Both [2]&#8901;+ and 3 rearrange in solution forming the 2D aromatic and planar imidazolium&#8208;substituted digermolide [4]2+ and germole&#8208;diide 5, respectively. Both planar species can be oxidized back to [1]2+ using AgSbF6. These redox&#8208;isomerizations correspond to the fundamental transformation of a 3D aromatic cluster into a 2D aromatic ring compound upon reduction and vice versa. The mechanism of these reactions was elucidated using DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments.

         <title>A Reactivity&#8208;Tunable Self&#8208;Immolative Design Enables Histone Deacetylase&#8208;Targeted Imaging and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a reactivity&#8208;tunable self&#8208;immolative design that enables activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and HDAC&#8208;responsive prodrug release in vivo. Our design highlights the potential for HDAC&#8208;targeted cancer diagnosis and drug development.







Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We developed a self&#8208;immolative design that enables in vivo activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC. This design comprises a phenyl ester linker with tunable reactivity, facilitating efficient release of caged fluorophores/drugs upon deacetylation. We engineered a new fluorophore using a spirocyclic xanthene scaffold with ring&#8208;open property, affording NIRF/PA detection with high contrast. We showed that a nitro&#8208;substituted self&#8208;immolative linker allows sensitive NIRF/PA in vivo imaging of HDAC with minimal interference. A highly efficient prodrug system was further developed for targeted therapy in HDAC&#8208;overexpressed triple negative breast tumors in mice. Our study provides a valuable paradigm for HDAC&#8208;targeted NIRF/PA imaging and prodrug release in vivo, highlighting its potential for bioimaging and drug development.

         <title>Anion Donicity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Carbon Fluoride Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium salt with a moderate donor number facilitates the electrochemical dissociation to the slightly ionic C&#8722;F bonds via a push&#8208;pull effect&#8212;moderate solvating power toward slightly positive&#8208;charged carbon atoms (push) and simultaneously ease in de&#8208;solvation for Li+&#8208;ions (pull). This effectively promotes the formation of graphitic carbon and crystalline LiF as discharge products, thereby boosting the specific capacity during discharge process.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy powers have greatly incentivized the development of lithium carbon fluoride (Li||CFx) cells. Five kinds of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes with various kinds of lithium salts (LiX, X=PF6&#8722;, TFSI&#8722;, BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, and CF3SO3&#8722;) were comparatively studied. Intriguingly, the LiBF4&#8208;based electrolyte show relatively moderate ionic conductivities; yet, the corresponding Li||CFx cells deliver the highest discharge capacities among them. A combination of morphological and compositional analyses of the discharge CFx cathode suggest that the moderate donicity of BF4&#8722; anion is accountable for favoring the breakdown of C&#8722;F bonds, and subsequently forming crystalline lithium fluoride as the main discharge products. This work brings not only fresh understanding on the role of salt anions for Li||CFx cells, but also inspire the electrolyte design for other conversion&#8208;type (sulfur and/or organosulfur) cathode materials desired for high&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Cationic Additive with a Rigid Solvation Shell for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In aqueous zinc ion batteries, Sc3+ with low water exchange rate constant (kex) has a dynamically rigid solvation shell, holding onto its spatial occupation and thus preventing zinc ions from concentrating near tips on the zinc metal surface towards indiscriminate dendrite growth. The rigidity of solvation shells of redox&#8208;inactive cations is proposed as a descriptor in determining the tip&#8208;blocking effect.







Abstract
Despite substantial progresses, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), developing zinc metal anodes with long&#8208;term reliable cycling capabilities is nontrivial because of dendritic growth and related parasitic reactions on the zinc surface. Here, we exploit the tip&#8208;blocking effect of a scandium (Sc3+) additive in the electrolyte to induce uniform zinc deposition. Additional to the tri&#8208;valency of Sc3+, the rigidity of its hydration shell effectively prevents zinc ions from concentrating at the surface tips, enabling highly stable cycling under challenging conditions. The shell rigidity, quantified by the rate constant of the exchange reaction (kex), is established as a key descriptor for evaluating the tip&#8208;blocking effect of redox&#8208;inactive cations, explaining inconsistent results when only the valence state is considered. Moreover, the tip&#8208;blocking effect of Sc3+ is maintained in blends with organic solvents, allowing the zinc anode to cycle reliably even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C without corrosion.

Achieving Dipeptidyl Peptidase 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) selectivity is a current challenge in chemical biology. Supported by activity&#8208;based protein profiling and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclose 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with different binding modes for DPP8/9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; subsite in DPP8 and the best selectivity index reported to date.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; (eS2&#8242;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.

         <title>Local Proton Source Enhanced Nitrogen Reduction on a Combined Cobalt&#8208;Molybdenum Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The appropriate amount of water adsorbed on the surface of Co&#8722;Mo co&#8208;embedded carbon nanofibers facilitated the formation of N&#8722;H bonds and promoted the protonation step of nitrogen reduction via proton source transfer from the water dissociation, which was confirmed by the results of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy experiments and isotopic labeling experiments using D2O and 15N2.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted considerable scientific and engineering interest as a green alternative route for NH3 production. Molybdenum is a promising candidate as an electrocatalyst for NRR as it has a suitable binding strength with N species. However, the design of an efficient Mo&#8208;based catalyst remains elusive. To enhance the selectivity of NRR toward NH3, we have developed a carbon nanofiber catalyst embedded with molybdenum and cobalt (Co&#8722;Mo&#8722;CNF). Co with a strong ability to dissociate water enhances local proton source near Mo, where the hydrogenation step of the NRR occurs. A NH3 formation rate of 72.72&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 34.5&#8201;% were obtained at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. We also attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the NRR via in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotopic labeling experiments using 15N2 and D2O.

         <title>Anchoring LiCl in the Nanopores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Ultra&#8208;High Uptake and Selective Separation of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents are developed by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of the metal&#8211;organic framework MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2, which show a record high capture capacity of 33.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 NH3 at 1.0&#8197;bar and 25&#8201;&#176;C as well as excellent selective separation performance of NH3 from NH3/N2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, NH3/CO2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and NH3/H2O at 50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is an important chemical raw material and a unique carbon&#8208;free fuel with high hydrogen energy density. Thus, NH3 capture, storage, and desorption are of significant importance. However, high capacity capture, low energy desorption, and selective separation of NH3 are still challengs so far. Here, we report high&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). It is found that the optimal composite shows a capture capacity of 33.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 NH3 at 1.0&#8197;bar and 25&#8201;&#176;C, which far exceeds the current record among the reported porous materials. Notably, the excellent capture capacity at low pressure and high temperature makes it possible to selectively capture NH3 from NH3/N2, NH3/CO2, and NH3/H2O. It is revealed that synergistic action of NH3 coordination to the highly dispersed Li+ in the MOF nanopores and hydrogen bonding of NH3 with Cl&#8722; account for such an excellent capture and selectivity performance.

         <title>Fluorinated Rocksalt Cathode with Ultra&#8208;high Active Li Content for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;capacity cathodes are restricted by the conflicts between the capacity and the structural instability. We report a new type of ultra&#8208;high Li compounds: Li4+xMoO5Fx (1&#8804;x&#8804;3) with the reversible shuttling of 3.8&#8197;Li+ ions per formula, showing the possibility of stabilizing the highly delithiated structure through the &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of fluorination. This discovery opens up new opportunities to extend the cathode materials into the ultra&#8208;high Li domain.







Abstract
The key to increasing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries is to incorporate high contents of extractable Li into the cathode. Unfortunately, this triggers formidable challenges including structural instability and irreversible chemistry under operation. Here, we report a new kind of ultra&#8208;high Li compound: Li4+xMoO5Fx (1&#8804;x&#8804;3) for cathode with an unprecedented level of electrochemically active Li (&gt;3&#8197;Li+ per formula), delivering a reversible capacity up to 438&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Unlike other reported Li&#8208;rich cathodes, Li4+xMoO5Fx presents distinguished structure stability to immunize against irreversible behaviors. Through spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, we find an anionic redox&#8208;dominated charge compensation with negligible oxygen release and voltage decay. Our theoretical analysis reveals a &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of high&#8208;level fluorination stabilizes the anionic redox by reducing the oxygen ions in pure&#8208;Li conditions, enabling a facile, reversible, and high Li&#8208;portion cycling.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Phase Engineering and Phosphorus Doping on Ru/P&#8208;TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium cluster anchored on a lightly P&#8208;doped defective TiO2 catalyst was designed for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. The surface oxygen vacancies enhanced water dissociation and P&#8208;doping facilitated the H2 generation by enabling hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.







Abstract
Synergistic optimization of the elementary steps of water dissociation and hydrogen desorption for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a challenge. Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P&#8208;doped defective TiO2 substrate (Ru/P&#8208;TiO2) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C&#8208;like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3&#8197;mA&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.05&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO2, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutile&#8208;TiO2&#8208;crystal&#8208;phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutile&#8208;TiO2 facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti4+ with P5+ enhanced H2 generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)/Imidazolidine Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylations were realized with novel C2&#8208;symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids, with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The C&#8722;H alkylation took place with simultaneous construction of central and axial chirality, reaching branched/linear ratios of &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er.







Abstract
Enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has surfaced as a transformative toolbox for the efficient assembly of chiral molecules. However, despite of major advances in rhodium and palladium catalysis, ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has thus far largely proven elusive. In contrast, we herein report on a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation. The key to success was represented by the identification of novel C2&#8208;symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids (CICAs), which are easily accessible in a one&#8208;pot fashion, as highly effective chiral ligands. This ruthenium/CICA system enabled the efficient installation of central and axial chirality, and featured excellent branched to linear ratios with generally &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er. Mechanistic studies by experiment and computation were carried out to understand the catalyst mode of action.

         <title>Gradient Heating Epitaxial Growth Gives Well Lattice&#8208;Matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N Heterointerfaces that Boost Both Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N was formed by a gradient heating epitaxial growth method. The unique heterointerface promotes hydrogen evolution kinetics in both acid and alkaline media by generating near&#8208;zero hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy and facilitating water dissociation. As a result, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in pH&#8208;universal media is achieved that is comparable to commercial Pt/C.







Abstract
An optimized approach to producing lattice&#8208;matched heterointerfaces for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution has not yet been reported. Herein, we present the synthesis of lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructures using a gradient heating epitaxial growth method. The well lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface of Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N generates near&#8208;zero hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy and facilitates water dissociation in acid and alkaline media. The lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructures have low overpotentials of 73&#8197;mV and 80&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively, comparable to commercial Pt/C. A novel photothermal&#8208;electrocatalytic water vapor splitting device using the lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructure as a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst displays a competitive cell voltage for electrocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Developing Isoxazole as a Native Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker for Photoaffinity Labeling and Chemoproteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoxazole is an essential pharmacophore in drug discovery. In this study, we investigated the photochemistry of isoxazole with biomolecules and developed it as a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics and drug discovery. With this strategy, two isoxazole&#8208;containing drugs were successfully applied to chemoproteomic platforms to uncover their cellular targets and interactions.







Abstract
Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique to interrogate drug&#8208;protein interactions in native cellular environments. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers are instrumental for this technique. However, the introduction of unnatural photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers may significantly reduce the bioactivity of the drug, thus impairing the chemoproteomic outcomes. Herein, we developed a common pharmacophore, isoxazole, into a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics, which minimally perturbs the drug structure. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking reactions of the isoxazole were thoroughly investigated for the first time. Functionalized isoxazoles were then designed and applied to protein labeling, demonstrating the superior photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking efficiency. Subsequently, two isoxazole&#8208;based drugs, Danazol and Luminespib, were employed in chemoproteomic studies, revealing their potential cellular targets. These results provide valuable strategies for future chemoproteomic study and drug development.

SuFEx warheads installed into a previously developed inhibitor scaffold that targets the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) deacylase, furnish covalently labeling inhibitors that pull down the enzyme from cells and tissue. With further optimization of the compound's potencies, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may provide the foundation for development of highly efficient covalent chemical probes and/or drug lead compounds targeting SIRT5.







Abstract
The sirtuin enzymes are a family of lysine deacylases that regulate gene transcription and metabolism. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolyzes malonyl, succinyl, and glutaryl &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications and has recently emerged as a vulnerability in certain cancers. However, chemical probes to illuminate its potential as a pharmacological target have been lacking. Here we report the harnessing of aryl fluorosulfate&#8208;based electrophiles as an avenue to furnish covalent inhibitors that target SIRT5. Alkyne&#8208;tagged affinity&#8208;labeling agents recognize and capture overexpressed SIRT5 in cultured HEK293T cells and can label SIRT5 in the hearts of mice upon intravenous injection of the compound. This work demonstrates the utility of aryl fluorosulfate electrophiles for targeting of SIRT5 and suggests this as a means for the development of potential covalent drug candidates. It is our hope that these results will serve as inspiration for future studies investigating SIRT5 and general sirtuin biology in the mitochondria.

         <title>Facet Engineering of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Support Modulates the Microenvironment of Palladium Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>

Pd nanoparticles supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF&#8208;8 with engineered crystal facets were coated with a ZIF&#8208;8 layer, to yield a series of MOF composites. ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, featuring electron&#8208;deficient Pd with a unique microenvironment created by the exposed (100) crystal facet of the ZIF&#8208;8 support, favors adsorption of &#8722;NO2 over &#8722;Cl, and thus, high activity and selectivity in halonitrobenzene hydrogenation to haloaniline.







Abstract
The exposed facets of supported catalysts play a crucial role in catalysis; however, they are usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, we have fabricated a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8211;organic framework composites, denoted ZIF&#8208;8X@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 (x represents the morphology of ZIF&#8208;8 core, i.e., ZIF&#8208;8C exposing (100) facet, ZIF&#8208;8RD exposing (110) facet, and ZIF&#8208;8TRD exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF&#8208;8 core, for hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. The Pd electronic state is tailored by the ZIF&#8208;8 core, where more electron&#8208;deficient Pd is found in ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 than that in ZIF&#8208;8RD@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, leading to discriminative adsorption of the &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;Cl groups of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. Consequently, ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits excellent activity (97.6&#8201;%) and selectivity (98.1&#8201;%) to p&#8208;chloroaniline. This work highlights crystal facet engineering of supports to modulate the microenvironment and electronic state of supported metal nanoparticles, offering a promising avenue to enhanced catalysis.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Uptake Relationship Study of DABCYL Derivatives Linked to Cyclic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>

Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides with DABCYL derivatives can enhance the formation of nucleation zones for small fluorescent cargoes. Structure variations of the DABCYL moiety significantly increased the cellular uptake efficiency of ubiquitin, resulting in efficient cytosolic transport at nanomolar concentrations.







Abstract
Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) peptides with 4&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) improves the uptake efficiency of synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) cargoes into living cells. To probe the role of the DABCYL moiety, we performed time&#8208;lapse microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of fluorescent DABCYL&#8208;R10 to evaluate the impact on cell entry by the formation of nucleation zones. Furthermore, we performed a structure&#8211;uptake relationship study with 13 DABCYL derivatives coupled to CPP to examine their effect on the cell&#8208;uptake efficiency when conjugated to mono&#8208;Ub through disulfide linkages. Our results show that through structure variations of the DABCYL moiety alone we could reach, at nanomolar concentration, an additional threefold increase in the cytosolic delivery of Ub, which will enable studies on various intracellular processes related to Ub signaling.

         <title>Realizing All&#8208;Climate Li&#8208;S Batteries by Using a Porous Sub&#8208;Nano Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) was constructed as a bifunctional separator coating for Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the merits of the narrow band gap and fully conjugated porous structure, the modified batteries can operate under temperatures ranging from &#8722;40 to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries with high energy density are currently receiving enormous attention. However, their redox kinetics at low temperature is extremely tardy, and polysulfides shuttling is serious at high temperature, which severely hinders the implementation of wide&#8208;temperature Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we propose an all&#8208;climate Li&#8208;S battery based on an ether&#8208;based electrolyte by using a porous sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) modified separator. It's demonstrated that the fully conjugated SAF&#8208;3 with a small pore size (0.97&#8197;nm) and narrow band gap (1.72&#8197;eV) could efficiently block the polysulfides shuttling at elevated temperature and boost the polysulfides conversion at low temperature. Consequently, the SAF&#8208;3 modified cells work well in a wide temperature ranging from &#8722;40 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, when operated at room temperature, the modified cell exhibits 90&#8201;% capacity retention over 100 cycles under high&#8208;sulfur loading (5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Enantioselective Ullmann Coupling of ortho&#8208;Chlorinated Aryl Aldehydes Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aldehydes enabled by a SBpy&#8208;type chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand. This mild and step&#8208;economical approach allowed the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryl dials, and also provided versatile intermediates for diverse axially chiral catalysts, ligands, and natural products.







Abstract
The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (+)&#8208;DTB&#8208;SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short&#8208;step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)&#8208;kotanin, (&#8722;)&#8208;isoschizandrin and (+)&#8208;gossypol.

     alt="Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Enantioselective Ullmann Coupling of ortho-Chlorinated Aryl Aldehydes Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#8242;-Bipyridine Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported is a general and highly enantioselective Ni-catalyzed reductive homocoupling of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-chlorinated aldehydes enabled by a SBpy-type chiral 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine ligand. This mild and step-economical approach allowed the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryl dials, and also provided versatile intermediates for diverse axially chiral catalysts, ligands, and natural products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first nickel-catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine ligand (+)-DTB-SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short-step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)-kotanin, (&#8722;)-isoschizandrin and (+)-gossypol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Copper&#8208;Zinc Alloy Layer Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode of Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer possessing high binding energy with Zn atoms and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn anode (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn). The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the side reactions such as pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Constructing stable surface modification layer is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zinc (Zn) metal anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. Herein, a multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer with superior Zn affinity, high toughness and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn foil (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn) to fabricate ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode. Owning to the advantages of high binding energy of Cu&#8722;Zn alloy layer with Zn atoms and less contact area between metallic Zn and electrolyte, the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances. Accordingly, the symmetric battery with Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 5496&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn//V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 600 cycles.

         <title>The Elusive Mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] Cluster in Three Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the synthesis and characterization of a three&#8208;member redox series (n=0, 1, 2) of mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters that model proposed intermediates in biological NO sensing. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis indicates a local {Fe&#8722;NO}7 configuration regardless of the charge state, with a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ antiferromagnetically coupled to 3[NO]&#8722;.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are well&#8208;established targets in biological nitric oxide (NO) chemistry, but the key intermediate in these processes&#8212;a mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] cluster&#8212;has not been fully characterized in a protein or a synthetic model thereof. Here, we report the synthesis of a three&#8208;member redox series of isostructural mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters. Mononitrosylation was achieved by binding NO to a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 site&#8208;differentiated [Fe4S4]+ cluster; subsequent oxidation and reduction afforded the other members of the series. All three clusters feature a local high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center antiferromagnetically coupled to 3[NO]&#8722;. The observation of an anionic NO ligand suggests that NO binding is accompanied by formal electron transfer from the cluster to NO. Preliminary reactivity studies with the monocationic cluster demonstrate that exposure to excess NO degrades the cluster, supporting the intermediacy of mononitrosylated intermediates in NO sensing/signaling.

         <title>Dissecting Critical Factors for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Atomically Precise Au Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factors in nanocluster (NCs)&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) are studied by comparing Au NCs with different sizes as well as Au38 isomer. Overall, the smaller size enables a higher activity due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, while the isomerism of the same&#8208;sized NCs can lead to significant changes in both activity and selectivity due to the difference in average formation energy of the key *COOH intermediate.







Abstract
This work investigates the critical factors impacting electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) as electrocatalysts. First, the influence of size on CO2RR is studied by precisely controlling NC size in the 1&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm regime. We find that the electrocatalytic CO partial current density increases for smaller NCs, but the CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) is not directly associated with the NC size. This indicates that the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, i.e. the population of active sites, is the dominant factor for determining the catalytic activity, but the selectivity is not directly impacted by size. Second, we compare the CO2RR performance of Au38 isomers (Au38Q and Au38T) to reveal that structural rearrangement of identical size NCs can lead to significant changes in both CO2RR activity and selectivity. Au38Q shows higher activity and selectivity towards CO than Au38T, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the average formation energy of the key *COOH intermediate on the proposed active sites is significantly lower on Au38Q than Au38T. These results demonstrate how the structural isomerism can impact stabilization of reaction intermediates as well as the overall CO2RR performance of identical size Au NCs. Overall, this work provides important structure&#8211;property relationships for tailoring the NCs for CO2RR.

         <title>Double&#8208;pronged Antimicrobial Agents based on a Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Type Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type photosensitizer featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE&#8208;PS) for curing infections caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. This AIE&#8208;PS achieved a high photodynamic killing efficacy towards both extracellular and intracellular pathogens in vitro and in vivo by inducing ROS accumulation, disrupting the bacterial membrane integrity and potentiating the lysosomal bioactivities of macrophages.







Abstract
Novel antibacterial agents are urgently needed to control the infections induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, we rationally designed and facilely synthesized a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type luminogen with strong red/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission, great aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, and excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The newly developed molecule TTTh killed the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by triggering the ROS accumulation in bacteria and interrupting the membrane integrity. Moreover, TTTh specifically targeted the lysosomes and potentiated their maturation to accelerate the clearance of intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reduced bacterial burden and improved healing were observed in TTTh&#8208;treated wounds with negligible side effects. Our study expands the biological design and application of AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and provides new insights into discovering novel antibacterial targets and agents.

         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8722;)&#8208;janoxepin, two fungal cyclotripeptides featuring a complex heterocyclic core and interesting phytotoxic and antimalarial activities, have been achieved in a highly convergent manner. In the key step, a one&#8208;pot cascade initiated by fragment coupling (cyclocondensation) was followed by a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement to afford a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product.







Abstract
Total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8722;)&#8208;janoxepin, two fungal cyclotripeptides featuring a complex heterocyclic core and interesting phytotoxic and antimalarial activities, have been achieved in a convergent manner. A key step in this synthesis is a one&#8208;pot cascade initiated by the cyclocondensation of two fragments&#8212;a hindered 2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;acyl fluoride and an electron&#8208;deficient cyclic amidine&#8212;to release a reactive spiro[2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1,5&#8242;&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;4&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dione]. This intermediate underwent a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement that was rationalized by DFT calculations. The cascade directly afforded a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product, and the challenging oxepin ring was finally forged by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of an allylic fluoride intermediate.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence from Phosphine&#8208;Stabilized Au3 Triangles and Au3Ag Pyramids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;blue cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes were realized by using phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangles and Au3Ag pyramids, featuring electroluminescence (EL) at 436&#8197;nm and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt;0.1.These results demonstrated the number of metal nuclei and the contributions of ligands to excited states are crucial for breaking the bottleneck of EL clusters in blue region.







Abstract
The optoelectronic applications of clusters emerged rapidly. Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes (CLED) as representative hold promise as a new generation of displays and lightings. However, as one of the main challenges in electroluminescence (EL) field, until present, no deep&#8208;blue CLEDs were reported, due to the strict requirements on excited&#8208;state characteristics of clusters. Herein, two phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangle and Au3Ag pyramid named [O(Audppy)3]BF4 and [O(Audppy)3Ag](BF4)2 were chosen to demonstrate efficient deep&#8208;blue CLEDs. The ligand&#8208;incorporated charge transfer transitions of the clusters contribute to both singlet and triplet excited states of the clusters, giving rise to phosphorescence at 460&#8197;nm and EL emissions at 436&#8197;nm. Based on device engineering, the maximum luminescence beyond 8000&#8197;nits and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt;0.1 in deep&#8208;blue region verify the competence of CLEDs for high&#8208;resolution displays.

         <title>Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squaramide supramolecular polymers exhibit uncommon thermoreversible polymorph transitions between fiber&#8208; and particle&#8208;like nanostructures driven by the molecular rearrangement of the squaramide units from slipped to head&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrogen bonds. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies reveal the concentration dependent nature and the on&#8208;pathway mechanism of the polymorph transitions which are of interest as stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded squaramide (SQ) supramolecular polymers exhibit uncommon thermoreversible polymorph transitions between particle&#8208; and fiber&#8208;like nanostructures. SQs 1&#8211;3, with different steric bulk, self&#8208;assemble in solution into particles (AggI) upon cooling to 298&#8197;K, and SQs 1 and 2, with only one dendronic group, show a reversible transformation into fibers (AggII) by further decreasing the temperature to 288&#8197;K. Nano&#8208;DSC and UV/Vis studies on SQ 1 reveal a concentration&#8208;dependent transition temperature and &#916;H for the AggI&#8208;to&#8208;AggII conversion, while the kinetic studies on SQ 2 indicate the on&#8208;pathway nature of the polymorph transition. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that these transitions are triggered by the molecular reorganization of the SQ units changing from slipped to head&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrogen bonding patterns. This work unveils the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of reversible polymorph transitions that are of interest to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>A Highly Twisted Carbazole&#8208;Fused DABNA Derivative as an Orange&#8208;Red TADF Emitter for OLEDs with Nearly 40&#8201;% EQE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is reported by fusing carbazoles to a MR framework DABNA to significantly redshift emission while maintaining the MR&#8208;dominated features. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA can deliver a high PLQY of 99&#8201;%. Its OLEDs reached a record&#8208;high EQE of 39.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is currently a research hotspot in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high color purity and high exciton utilization. However, there are only a handful of MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emissions beyond the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. The very limited emission colors for MR&#8208;TADF emitters are mainly caused by the fact that so far molecular modifications of MR&#8208;TADF do not offer much change in the emission colors. Here, we report a new approach to modifying a prototypical MR core of DABNA by fusing carbazoles to the MR framework. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule (TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA) basically maintains the MR&#8208;dominated features of DABNA while red&#8208;shifting the emission. Its OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 39.2&#8201;% with a peak at 588&#8197;nm, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for OLEDs with peaks beyond 560&#8197;nm. This work provides a new approach for significantly tunning emission colors of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>From Inert to Catalytically Active Milling Media: Galvanostatic Coating for Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The galvanostatic coating of milling balls and vessels advances commonly inert materials into catalytically active milling media. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness are crucial for achieving high activities in the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction for multiple cycles. The interplay between the mechanical impact of the ball and the catalytically available surface is elucidated.







Abstract
The inert milling balls, commonly utilized in mechanochemical reactions, were coated with a layer of Pd and utilized as catalyst in the direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki reaction. With high yields (&gt;80&#8201;%), the milling balls can be recycled multiple times in the absence of any solvents, ligands, catalyst&#8208;molecules and &#8208;powders, while utilizing as little as 0.8&#8197;mg of Pd per coated milling ball. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness were examined towards archiving high catalyst retention, low abrasion and high conversion. The approach was transferred to the coating of milling vessels revealing the interplay between catalytically available surface area and the mechanical energy impact in direct mechanocatalysis.

         <title>4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;Labeling Constitutes a Sensitive 19F NMR Probe for Characterization of Interactions in the Minor Groove of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thymidine modified with a 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 group exhibits a rather flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and is accommodated well by different higher order DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high 19F NMR sensitivity of 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;thymidine make it an excellent probe for quantitatively distinguishing various DNA structures and for monitoring the dynamics of DNA&#8208;protein interactions in the minor groove by means of 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Fluorinated nucleotides are invaluable for 19F NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and function. Here, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;thymidine (T
) and incorporated it into DNA by means of solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis. NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high 19F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T
 within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T
 make it a valuable 19F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA.

         <title>Hierarchical Assembly of a Micro&#8208; and Macroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Tailored Single&#8208;Crystal Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a crystal of a porous organic material based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with hierarchical micro and macroporosity is reported. During the skeletal growth, the crystal size can be easily tailored from micro to centimetre scale while preserving the hierarchical porosity. We used the hierarchical porosity for the sequential co&#8208;recognition of microparticles and molecular species.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials represent an emergent field of research in Chemistry and Materials Science due to their unique combination of properties. To enhance their performance and expand the number of applications, the incorporation of hierarchical porosity is required, as exclusive microporosity entails several limitations. However, the integration of macropores in porous organic molecular materials is still an outstanding challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MM&#8208;TPY) with hierarchical skeletal morphology, containing stable micro&#8208; and macroporosity. The crystal size, from micro to centimetre scale, can be controlled in a single step without using additives or templates. The mechanism of assembly during the crystal formation is compatible with a skeletal crystal growth. As proof of concept, we employed the hierarchical porosity as a platform for the dual, sequential and selective co&#8208;recognition of molecular species and microparticles.

         <title>Back Cover: Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular bioorthogonal metabolic shunt has been shown to successfully link reduced oxygen concentration to singlet oxygen generation with an intermediate fluoride releasing step. As reported by Lei Wang, Engin&#8197;U. Akkaya et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202210249), this approach not only broadens the spectrum of intracellular bioorthogonal reactions, but at the same time highlights a new pathway to follow towards smart and selective therapeutic agents, with precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen.

         <title>Inside Cover: Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoreversible polymorph transitions &#160;in supramolecular polymers&#160;are reported in the Communication (e202213345) by Juan Arag&#243;, Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. This behavior was observed in a new family of squaramides that self&#8208;assemble into particles at room temperature and undergo a reversible morphological transformation into fibers when the sample is cooled. This transformation is triggered by a molecular rearrangement of the aggregated system implying a change in the squaramide hydrogen bonding pattern.

         <dc:description>
The energy&#8208;efficient separation of alkane isomers for gasoline upgrading using Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks with auxetic reentrant pore structures is reported by Dan Zhao et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202211808). The honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows of the pore structure lead to a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and to high capacities for other isomers.

A lone 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam molecule moves towards the catalytic site of an illuminated dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) in a vast universe of chemical space. Achieving DPP8/9 selectivity has remained a challenge in chemical biology. The 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams, identified by a chemoproteomics platform as DPP8/9 inhibitors, may hold the key to the highly sought DPP8/9 selectivity via an unprecedented DPP8&#8208;specific mechanism, as demonstrated through X&#8208;ray diffraction by Markus Kaiser, Rui Moreira et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202210498).

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes by Photosensitized Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent seminal findings on the possibility to use photoexcited nitroarenes as modular and easily dosable reagents which can mimic the reactivity of ozonolysis for the oxidative conversion of alkenyl bonds into carbonyl groups in a highly selective fashion.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of alkenes into carbonyl molecules mainly relies on either ozonolysis or Lemieux&#8208;Johnson oxidation involving high valent transition metal oxides. Safety, technical concerns and highly oxidizing conditions of both these procedures limited their adoption in streamlined synthesis. Like ozone, photosensitized nitroarenes can deliver similar types of [3+2] cycloaddition products with alkenes through biradical formation and the resulting &#8220;N&#8208;doped&#8221; ozonides can safely be converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds through hydrolysis. The high prevalence of nitroarenes with diverse electronic and steric profiles combined with the mild oxidizing power allow to modulate site&#8208;selectivity and tolerate highly sensitive functional groups ideal for application in complex molecular setup.

         <title>Biomolecule&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials: Construction, Progress, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, the generation, induction and amplification of CPL&#8208;active materials based on biomolecules, as well as their emerging applications due to sensitive CPL signals, are reviewed and prospects for future development considered. New insights are also provided towards the design of chiral functional biomaterials and their potential applications.







Abstract
Chiral materials related to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) make up a rapidly developing new field that has broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices, selective recognition, biomedicine, and other fields. Biofunctional chiral materials are also attracting increasing attention because of their unique biocompatibility, chiral recognition, and coding. However, there has been little discussion on biomolecule&#8208;based CPL till now. In this Review, the latest progress in CPL materials related with biomolecules are reviewed, including the chiral construction from molecular level to giant microstructure, as well as their emerging applications. In addition, we discuss the challenges and prospects of bio&#8208;based CPL materials, hoping this work will provide new perspectives and insights for more related research.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs have made tremendous development as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic reactions. Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations and focuses on the photocatalytic mechanisms subdivided according to the type of reactions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging category of organic polymers with highly porous crystalline structures. In the last decade, reports on the use of COFs as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations have shown significant progress. Still, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of the photocatalytic organic transformations using COFs are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations. Firstly, we discuss the photophysical properties and the characterization methods of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Then, the general photocatalytic mechanism, the advantages, and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts are summarized. After that, advanced examples of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations are analyzed with regard to the underlying mechanisms. The Review ends with a critical perspective on the challenges and prospects.

         <title>Challenges Arising from Continuous&#8208;Flow Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview aims to provide a survey of the symbiotic developments of flow chemistry and olefin metathesis. Looking at the current state of the art, key challenges have been retrospectively identified in terms of both catalyst and flow reactor design and development, which together paint an intriguing outlook for the future development at this interface.







Abstract
The versatility of olefin metathesis is evident from its successful applications ranging from natural product synthesis to the valorization of renewable feedstocks. On the other side, flow chemistry has recently gained particular interest among the synthetic community, offering valuable alternatives to classic batch chemistry and paving the way to the development of new transformations. The application of continuous&#8208;flow methods to olefin metathesis represents one of the most promising evolutions in the field at the interface of industrially relevant synthesis and reactor engineering, significantly improving some of the typical problems such as undesired self&#8208;reactions and ethylene&#8208;mediated catalyst deactivation. This Minireview aims to provide a brief survey covering the major aspects of those techniques which we hope may be of interest for the chemical community as well as those interested in catalysis, continuous processing, enabling technologies and reactor design.

&lt;p&gt;This Minireview aims to provide a survey of the symbiotic developments of flow chemistry and olefin metathesis. Looking at the current state of the art, key challenges have been retrospectively identified in terms of both catalyst and flow reactor design and development, which together paint an intriguing outlook for the future development at this interface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The versatility of olefin metathesis is evident from its successful applications ranging from natural product synthesis to the valorization of renewable feedstocks. On the other side, flow chemistry has recently gained particular interest among the synthetic community, offering valuable alternatives to classic batch chemistry and paving the way to the development of new transformations. The application of continuous-flow methods to olefin metathesis represents one of the most promising evolutions in the field at the interface of industrially relevant synthesis and reactor engineering, significantly improving some of the typical problems such as undesired self-reactions and ethylene-mediated catalyst deactivation. This Minireview aims to provide a brief survey covering the major aspects of those techniques which we hope may be of interest for the chemical community as well as those interested in catalysis, continuous processing, enabling technologies and reactor design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counter Electrode Reactions&#8212;Important Stumbling Blocks on the Way to a Working Electro&#8208;organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every electrochemical synthesis is paired with conversion at the counter electrode. In electro&#8208;organic synthesis, often only the desired half reaction is described well, although good control over the counter reaction is essential. In this Review, the impact of the counter electrode reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted through a collection of common and unusual counter reactions.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has gained significant interest, both in technical and academic research as well as in terms of applications. The omission of stoichiometric oxidizers or reducing agents enables a more sustainable route for redox reactions in organic chemistry. Even if it is well&#8208;known that every electrochemical oxidation is only viable with an associated reduction reaction and vice versa, the relevance of the counter reaction is often less addressed. In this Review, the importance of the corresponding counter reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted and how it can affect the performance and selectivity of the electrolytic conversion. A selection of common strategies and unique concepts to tackle this issue are surveyed to provide a guide to select appropriate counter reactions for electro&#8208;organic synthesis.

         <title>Stimuli Responsive Silylene: Electromerism Induced Reversible Switching Between Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed valent silicon compound is synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The mixed valency of the compound allowed reversible electromerism under the influence of Lewis&#8208;acid/base acting as external stimuli. A mono&#8208;silylene ligand could be transformed to bis&#8208;silylene by adding CuI salts. Upon removal of CuI salts, the bis&#8208;silylene motif reverts back to mono&#8208;silylene.







Abstract
Electromerism is a very well&#8208;known phenomenon in transition metal chemistry. In main group chemistry, this concept has only started getting attention recently. We report stimuli responsive low&#8208;valent silicon compounds exhibiting electromerism. A mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8208;silylene 1, [LSi&#8722;Si(NDipp)L] (L=PhC(NtBu)2), was synthesized in a single step from amidinate&#8208;chlorosilylene. Compound 1 has two interconnected Si atoms in formally +I and +III oxidation states. Upon treatment with Lewis acidic CuIX (X=mesityl, Cl, Br, I), electron redistribution occurs resulting in the formation of [{LSi(NDipp)Si(L)}&#8722;CuX], in which both silicon atoms are in the +II formal oxidation state. Removal of the copper center from [{LSi(NDipp)Si(L)}&#8722;CuX] by using a Lewis basic carbene led to reformation of the precursor [LSi&#8722;Si(NDipp)L]. Thus, the process is fully reversible. This showcases the first example of Lewis acid/base&#8208;induced reversible electromerism in silicon chemistry.

         <title>Mesoporous N&#8208;rich Carbon with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon with single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(p)) is synthesized by a novel and facile strategy and employed as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The unique architecture, N dopant, and single&#8208;Ni atoms enable the effective confinement and fast redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides towards efficient Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, a NH4Cl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is developed to fabricate highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon (designed as NC(p)) featuring thin outer shells and porous inner networks, on which single&#8208;Ni atoms are anchored to form an excellent sulfur host (designed as Ni&#8208;NC(p)) for Li&#8208;S batteries. During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF&#8208;8 will in situ etch ZIF&#8208;8 to produce rich mesoporous in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni&#8208;NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single&#8208;Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni&#8208;NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li&#8208;S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.

         <title>Linear Axially Chiral Conjugated Polymers Exhibiting Ultralong Low&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of linear axially chiral conjugated polymers were constructed in a facile manner. These polymers showed an ultralong low&#8208;temperature afterglow of up to 33&#8197;s and also exhibited intense circularly polarized luminescence with an absolute glum value of up to 0.01.







Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), as two important branches in the field of organic optical functional materials have broad prospects. In this work, a pair of novel conjugated polymers with low&#8208;temperature UOP and intense CPL properties are constructed by incorporating rigid axially chiral chromophores into a polymeric backbone. The twisted and rigid biphenyl skeleton not only effectively reduces the energy gap between the S1 and T to greatly facilitate the intersystem crossing process, but also suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay from T1 to S0. As a result, a strong and ultralong afterglow of up to 33&#8197;s is achieved in 2&#8208;MeTHF at 77&#8197;K. Moreover, the repeating rigid biphenyl skeleton with its helix&#8208;like form also promotes the chiroptical activity of the polymers, and intense signals are shown in the low&#8208;temperature CPL spectra with absolute glum values of 9.7&#215;10&#8722;3 and 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission peaks, respectively. This work represents the first low&#8208;temperature materials with UOP and CPL properties, which provides a new guideline and perspective for the development of persistent luminescence materials.

         <title>PNP Ligands in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Activation and Functionalization of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be activated in the coordination sphere of cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of N,N bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand gives a P4 transformation into a zig&#8208;zag chain which can readily be functionalized by Ph2P groups to form a complex containing a unique P9&#8208;ligand. The presence of an organic substituent at the nitrogen atom in the PNP ligand gives complexes with an &#951;1&#8208;coordinated P4 molecule.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated white phosphorus activation is of high interest as an ecological alternative to P4 chlorination pathway to the practically useful phosphorus products. Herein, we report a facile approach for P4 activation, transformation and subsequent functionalization using cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand allows one to transform P4 tetrahedron into a zig&#8208;zag chain with the formation of complex [Co(Ph2PNHP(Ph2)PPPPP(Ph2)NHPPh2)]BF4 (4). The presence of organic substituent at nitrogen atom in PNP ligand enables one to obtain complexes with &#951;1&#8208;coordinated P4 molecule, which indicates a crucial role of N&#8722;H bond in transformation of white phosphorus tetrahedron. Additionally, complex 4 can readily be functionalized by means of the reaction with Ph2PCl leading to the formation of a new complex bearing unique P9&#8208;ligand. The obtained results provide opportunities for facile construction of new polyphosphorus ligands in the coordination sphere of transition metal complexes.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Edged [4]Triangulene: Facile Synthesis and Two&#8208;Dimensional On&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Assemblies
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of [4]heterotriangulene with three oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (OBO) segments incorporated into the zigzag edges has been synthesized. The unprecedented OBO&#8208;doped [4]triangulene exhibits long&#8208;range ordered 2D nanoarchitectures on metal surfaces, with a substrate&#8208;dependent character that is superior to previous nanographene&#8208;based 2D assemblies and thus holds potential for future nanotechnological applications.







Abstract
Triangulenes have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science, but suffer from their high instability towards oxygen. Embedding heteroatoms into triangulenes provides a new class of ambient stable materials for various applications. However, [3]heterotriangulenes have dominated the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped triangulenes, while their higher homologues have been rarely explored. In this work, we synthesize a new [4]heterotriangulene with three oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (OBO) segments incorporated into the zigzag edges. The planar geometry of the OBO&#8208;doped [4]triangulene is demonstrated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Self&#8208;assembly on metal surfaces reveals substrate&#8208;dependent nanostructures, leading to different long&#8208;range ordered 2D patterns on Ag and Cu substrates with negligible defects.

         <title>A Photoelectrochemical Nanoreactor for Single&#8208;Cell Sampling and Near Zero&#8208;Background Faradaic Detection of Intracellular microRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical nanoreactor was devised for single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background faradic detection of intracellular microRNA. This platform provided a new perspective for exploring light&#8208;biomatter interplay toward single&#8208;cell studies.







Abstract
Rational utilization of the rich light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay taking place in single&#8208;cell analysis represents a new technological direction in the field. The light&#8208;fueled operation is expected to achieve advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) single&#8208;cell analysis with unknown possibilities. Here, a PEC nanoreactor capable of single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background Faradaic detection of intracellular microRNA (miR) is devised by the construction of a small reaction chamber accommodating the target&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction for binding the metallointercalator of [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ as the signal reporter. Light stimulation of the dsDNA/metallointercalator adduct will induce the generation of photocurrents, underpinning a zero&#8208;biased and near zero&#8208;background PEC method toward Faradaic detection of non&#8208;electrogenic miR at the single&#8208;cell level. Using this nanotool, lower miR concentration in the near&#8208;nucleus region than that in the main cytosol was revealed.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Asymmetric Preparation of &#945;&#8208;Stereogenic Allyl Silanes, Germanes, and Boronate Esters via Dual Copper Hydride&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids (M=B, Si, Ge) with broad functional group compatibility has been developed. This protocol employs dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis to access a variety of allyl metalloid species from readily accessible vinyl metalloids and enol triflates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Stereogenic allyl metalloids are versatile synthetic intermediates which can undergo various stereocontrolled transformations. Most existing methods to prepare &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids involve multi&#8208;step sequences that curtail the number of compatible substrates and are limited to the synthesis of boronates. Here, we report a general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids utilizing dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis. This approach leverages a stereoretentive Cu&#8208;to&#8208;Pd transmetalation of an in situ generated alkyl copper species to allow access to enantioenriched allyl silanes, germanes, and boronate esters with broad functional group compatibility.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed PIDA&#8208;Mediated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Amino Acid Derivatives: Overriding Competitive Intramolecular Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of amino acid derivatives has been achieved by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The N&#8208;SO2Py protecting/directing group plays a key role in enabling control of chemoselectivity (intermolecular C&#8722;O over intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation) and regioselectivity (favoring &#948;&#8208;CH3 over &#947;&#8208;CH2 activation).







Abstract
The selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of N&#8208;(SO2Py)&#8208;protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO2Py compared to more traditional carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8722;H amination. The &#948;&#8208;site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5&#8208;membered cyclopalladation at competitive &#947;&#8208;CH2. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The selective &#948;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H acetoxylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Py)-protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium-catalysis and PhI(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Py compared to more traditional carbonyl-based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8722;H amination. The &#948;-site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5-membered cyclopalladation at competitive &#947;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endohedrally Functionalized Heteroleptic Coordination Cages for Phosphate Ester Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroleptic [Pd2A2B2] coordination cages was prepared by shape&#8208;complementary assembly (SCA) from a modular set of ligands and screened for binding phosphate guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that an endohedral hydrogen bond donor site is the decisive but not exclusive factor for binding phosphate diesters inside the cavity in a competitive solvent.







Abstract
Metallosupramolecular hosts of nanoscopic dimensions, which are able to serve as selective receptors and catalysts, are usually composed of only one type of organic ligand, restricting diversity in terms of cavity shape and functional group decoration. We report a series of heteroleptic [Pd2A2B2] coordination cages that self&#8208;assemble from a library of shape complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. Ligands A feature an inward pointing NH function, able to engage in hydrogen bonding and amenable to being functionalized with amide and alkyl substituents. Ligands B comprise tricyclic aromatic backbones of different shape and electronic situation. The obtained heteroleptic coordination cages were investigated for their ability to bind phosphate diesters as guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent were conducted to understand the mechanistic relationships behind the experimentally determined guest affinities.

         <title>Reversible Copper Cathode for Nonaqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports that copper metal can work as a cathode of dual&#8208;ion batteries in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. The reversible conversion between commercial bulk copper metal and copper salt Cu(TFSI)2 demonstrates high capacity, relatively high voltage, and relatively stable cycle life in lithium dual&#8208;ion batteries. This finding may offer a promising direction for enhancing the energy density of dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Most reported cathodes of nonaqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) host anions via insertion reactions. It is necessary to explore new cathode chemistry to increase the battery energy density. To date, transition metals have yet to be investigated for nonaqueous DIBs, albeit they may offer high capacity in anodic conversion reactions. Here, we report that bulk copper powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of 762&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.2&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li and relatively stable cycling in common organic electrolytes. The operation of the copper electrode is coupled with the transfer of anion charge carriers. An anion exchange membrane separator is employed to prevent Cu2+ from crossing from the catholyte to the anode side. We designed an unbalanced electrolyte with a more concentrated anolyte than a catholyte. This addresses the concentration overpotential ensued during charge and facilitates the high specific capacity and enhanced reversibility. This finding provides a promising direction for high&#8208;energy DIBs.

         <title>Improved Charge Separation in Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) Imides with Semi&#8208;coherent Interfaces for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides with a semi&#8208;coherent interface largely promote the separation and transfer of charge carriers owing to the built&#8208;in electric field and thereby enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.







Abstract
The construction of heterojunctions is a promising manner to accelerate the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface. Herein, a binary poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides (PHI/PTI) with semi&#8208;coherent interfaces was fabricated via a facile two&#8208;step salt&#8208;melt synthetic process. The built&#8208;in electric fields at the semi&#8208;coherent interface endow prompt exciton splitting and charge carrier separation. Hence, the optimized PHI/PTI&#8208;based copolymer presents a high apparent quantum yield (AQY=64&#8201;%) for visible&#8208;light driven hydrogen production, by the aids of K2HPO4 as charge transfer mediator. This study provides physical insights for the rational promotion of the photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of interfacial engineering of photocatalytic junctions on crystalline carbon nitride based semiconductors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Alcohols via Nickel Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alcohols B is presented that exploits the condensation of iodoarenes and the redox active ether A via cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. A mechanistic study was conducted using a comprehensive computational investigation that was also supported by ad hoc control experiments and showed that the key 1,2&#8208;HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) event results in the formation of a C&#8208;centered radical C&#8242; that mimics the reactivity of trifluoroacetaldehyde.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between the redox&#8208;active N&#8208;trifluoroethoxyphthalimide and iodoarenes is documented. The protocol reproduces a formal arylation of trifluoroacetaldehyde under mild conditions in high yields (up to 88&#8201;%) and with large functional group tolerance (30 examples). A combined computational and experimental investigation revealed a pivotal solvent assisted 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) process to generate a nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl C&#8208;centered radical for the Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bond forming process.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Targeted Polypeptide Nanoantidotes Improve Chemotherapy Tolerance of Cisplatin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the presence of disulfide bonds, nanoantidotes capture cisplatin (CDDP) through highly stable Pt&#8722;S bonds to form a series of non&#8208;toxic mononuclear/dinuclear complexes centered on Pt atoms. The pre&#8208;enriched nanoantidotes accelerate the metabolism of CDDP from normal organs, reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, and improve the therapeutic window of the free drug.







Abstract
The toxicity of drugs causes various adverse effects in patients. While antidotes that neutralize drug toxicity help reduce systemic damage during clinical therapy, these antidotes are generally accompanied by the loss of drug efficacy. Herein, the spatiotemporally targeted polycystine&#8208;based nanoantidotes were designed as a neutralizer of cisplatin (CDDP) to decrease its toxicity without affecting its anticancer efficacy. The nanoantidotes administered before CDDP selectively accumulated in the liver and kidney and then firmly bound to CDDP through the highly stable Pt&#8722;S bond during subsequent chemotherapy. This two&#8208;step administration strategy reduced the level of Pt in normal organs, shortened the half&#8208;life of CDDP in plasma, and increased the tolerance to CDDP.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the presence of disulfide bonds, nanoantidotes capture cisplatin (CDDP) through highly stable Pt&#8722;S bonds to form a series of non-toxic mononuclear/dinuclear complexes centered on Pt atoms. The pre-enriched nanoantidotes accelerate the metabolism of CDDP from normal organs, reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, and improve the therapeutic window of the free drug.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toxicity of drugs causes various adverse effects in patients. While antidotes that neutralize drug toxicity help reduce systemic damage during clinical therapy, these antidotes are generally accompanied by the loss of drug efficacy. Herein, the spatiotemporally targeted polycystine-based nanoantidotes were designed as a neutralizer of cisplatin (CDDP) to decrease its toxicity without affecting its anticancer efficacy. The nanoantidotes administered before CDDP selectively accumulated in the liver and kidney and then firmly bound to CDDP through the highly stable Pt&#8722;S bond during subsequent chemotherapy. This two-step administration strategy reduced the level of Pt in normal organs, shortened the half-life of CDDP in plasma, and increased the tolerance to CDDP. More importantly, the nanoantidotes maintained the anticancer efficacy of CDDP after reducing systemic toxicity, indicating its great potential in expanding the clinical application of CDDP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Anilines with Aromatic Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides has been achieved by a metalla&#8208;tautomerism approach. The reactivity of an aniline towards a palladium catalyst was relayed from the NH group into the aromatic ring. Out of four possible positions, the catalytic arylation was directed exclusively into the para&#8208;C&#8722;H position by a bulky ligand at the palladium in combination with a temporarily installed shielding group.







Abstract
Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H functionalizations is a key challenge in chemical method development. In arenes, functionalizations are most difficult to direct towards the C&#8722;H group furthest away from a substituent, in its para position. We herein demonstrate how the para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides, elusive to date, is achieved by a base&#8208;assisted &#8220;metalla&#8208;tautomerism&#8221; approach. A proton is abstracted from the aniline substrate and replaced by an arylpalladium species, generated from the aryl halide coupling partner. In this step, the palladium is directed away from the N&#8208; to the tautomeric para&#8208;C&#8722;H position by a large phosphine ligand combined with a triphenylmethyl shielding group. The triphenylmethyl group is easily installed and removed, and can be recycled.

         <title>Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodular endoperoxide with a hypoxia sensitive functionality and fluoride&#8208;reactive stopper for the cycloreversion was synthesized. Under reductive conditions of the hypoxic cancer cells, a bioorthogonal shunt which releases cytotoxic singlet oxygen via the intermediacy of a fluoride signal becomes operative. The result is a very precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen, which opens a new path toward potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen can be generated by thermal cycloreversion of aromatic endoperoxides. However, for any practical potential of chemically generated singlet oxygen within a therapeutic context, the time and place of the release of this cytotoxic species must be tightly regulated. We now show that using a bimodular design with a hypoxia responsive unit and fluoride&#8208;triggered endoperoxide unit, a bioorthogonal metabolic shunt can be established, where an enzymatically generated submicromolar fluoride signal plays a crucial role. Thus, cellular nitroreductase is repurposed in a bioorthogonal enzymatic activity, where it releases fluoride ions upon the reduction of a targeted compound. The fluoride ions released in the initial reaction remove the silyl stopper, yielding a highly accelerated release of singlet oxygen. The result is a remarkable difference in cytotoxicity between hypoxic and normoxic conditions as evidenced by microscopy, viability assays and the use of control compounds.

A sequential phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation and oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer strategy has been developed, allowing for rapid access to a range of axially chiral CF3&#8208;containing 2&#8208;arylpyrroles with high enantiomeric excess.

A sequential phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of aldimines with allenoates and oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer strategy has been developed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a range of axially chiral CF3&#8208;containing 2&#8208;arylpyrroles with high enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, an atroposelective synthesis of esaxerenone is presented, illustrating the practical potential of the reported method.

         <title>A Missing Link in Multisubstituted Pyrrolidines: Remote Stereocontrol Forged by Rhodium&#8208;Alkyl Nitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the importance of pyrrolidines in drug discovery together with the dearth of methods for synthesizing multisubstituted heterocycles with nonadjacent stereocenters, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination. The present protocol addresses the prevalent limitations associated with substituted pyrrolidines.







Abstract
Pyrrolidines are significant N&#8208;heterocycles in medicinal chemistry and are among the top ten ring systems found in drug molecules. While simple derivatives are commercially available, densely decorated derivatives with precise stereochemical arrangements remain difficult to obtain. Methods for synthesizing multisubstituted pyrrolidines with nonadjacent stereocenters are particularly scarce. To bridge this gap, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination. The transformation proceeds well in the presence of various functionalities with exclusive anti&#8208;selectivity. Carboxylic acids in the products serve as gateways for diverse downstream transformations. Furthermore, the combined experimental and computational study sheds lights on the origin of high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Cluster Nanospheres in Water&#8208;Deficient Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium carbonate(ACC) nanoparticles are synthesized in water&#8208;deficient ethanol solution. The nanoparticles consist of tiny clusters as revealed by cryo&#8208;TEM. ACC can aggregate on templates such as graphene oxide nanosheets. These findings provide a theoretical basis for controlled synthesis of ACC and a strategy to fabricate ultrathin mineral coatings on different substrates.







Abstract
As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long&#8208;range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water&#8208;deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo&#8208;TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water&#8208;alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.

     alt="Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Cluster Nanospheres in Water-Deficient Organic Solvents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous calcium carbonate(ACC) nanoparticles are synthesized in water-deficient ethanol solution. The nanoparticles consist of tiny clusters as revealed by cryo-TEM. ACC can aggregate on templates such as graphene oxide nanosheets. These findings provide a theoretical basis for controlled synthesis of ACC and a strategy to fabricate ultrathin mineral coatings on different substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long-range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water-deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo-TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water-alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected Persistent Production of Reactive Oxygen Species during the Degradation of Black Phosphorous in the Darkness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation mechanism of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is not well understood. It is now shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is involved in the FLBP degradation process even in the dark. This ROS generation is persistent and proceeds in a three&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is easily degraded under ambient conditions which is problem that hinders the application of FLBP, but its degradation mechanism is not yet well understood. In this work, we surprisingly found that persistent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was involved in FLBP degradation even in the dark. The ROS generation patterns and mechanism were revealed by chemiluminescence (CL) and density functional theory (DFT). Meanwhile, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) can also be removed by FLBP under dark conditions, which further shows the ROS generation during FLBP self&#8208;degradation. This work provides new insights into the FLBP self&#8208;degradation mechanism and opens opportunities to practically implement FLBP for green catalytic application.

         <title>Efficient Splitting of Alkane Isomers by a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Auxetic Reentrant Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient gasoline upgrading with a research octane number (RON) higher than 96 was achieved in a reentrant auxetic honeycomb&#8208;like bismuth&#8208;based MOF with a combined fitting of pore window and chemistry. It enables the unprecedented exclusion of di&#8208;branched isomers and molecular discrimination of linear and mono&#8208;branched alkanes.







Abstract
The isolation of di&#8208;branched alkanes from their isomers is vital in gasoline upgrading to achieve high octane numbers but is significantly challenging and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of hexane isomers by combing molecular recognition and size&#8208;sieving in a bismuth&#8208;based MOF, UU&#8208;200. The unique auxetic structure with reentrant honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows endows UU&#8208;200 with a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and high capacities for linear and mono&#8208;branched isomers. The molecular sieving effect, unprecedented separation selectivities, and excellent efficiencies are proved via adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments with high research octane numbers obtained (&gt;96), indicating a benchmark for alkane separation under ambient conditions. The molecular recognition mechanism was unveiled by theoretical simulation and in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy.

         <dc:description>
An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide at room temperature has been developed. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation, this work provides an efficient site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation method, which may be used in the late&#8208;stage carboxylation modification of drug molecules.







Abstract
Carboxyl group is one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Herein, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide (CO2) at room temperature has been developed. The reaction employs low loading of cuprous chloride catalyst under 1&#8197;atm CO2 and exhibits good functional group tolerance. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, this work provides an efficient method for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It may serve as a significant late&#8208;stage carboxylation tool for the modification of drug molecules in the future.

         <title>Highly Controllable Nanoassemblies of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Abnormal Disassembly&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement for In Vivo Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (&gt;6 fold, with quantum yields (QYs) as high as 12&#8201;%) is observed from the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with highly redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm and QYs of 1.8&#8201;%. The nanoassemblies are fabricated through a facile and feasible method using a unique Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si crosslinking strategy in solution.







Abstract
Assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been widely observed for luminophors but it causes emission decrease after disassembly. The construction of unique nanoassemblies with disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (DIEE) is demanded. Herein, by taking advantages of alterable siloxane bridge crosslinking states, we report a facile strategy to fabricate water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with abnormal DIEE. The fabricated AuNP nanoassemblies with dominant interparticle crosslinking showed a redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm with quantum yields (QYs) of 1.8&#8201;%. After disassembly, the nanoassemblies with increased intraparticle crosslinking exhibited a unique DIEE (&gt;6 folds, QYs, 12&#8201;%) due to the enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition. Besides, the disassembly facilitated renal clearance of AuNPs to reduce nonspecific retention in the body, opening new possibilities for designing highly emissive renal&#8208;clearable nanostructures toward more bioapplications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework@Metal Oxide Heterostructures Induced by Electron&#8208;Beam Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF synthesis is achieved by high&#8208;energy electron&#8208;beam irradiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. For ZIF&#8208;8, this synthesis can be accomplished within minutes under ambient conditions, with an energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal route. By changing the dose of the electron beam a hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8@ZnO heterostructure can be formed.







Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a distinct family of crystalline porous materials finding extensive applications. Their synthesis often requires elevated temperature and relatively long reaction time. We report here the first case of MOF synthesis activated by high&#8208;energy (1.5&#8197;MeV) electron beam radiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. Using ZIF&#8208;8 as a representative for demonstration, this type of synthesis can be accomplished under ambient conditions within minutes, leading to energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal condition. Interestingly, by controlling the absorbed dose in the synthesis, the electron beam not only activates the formation reaction of ZIF&#8208;8, but also partially etches the material during the synthesis affording a hierarchical pore architecture and highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8. This gives rise to a new strategy to obtain MOF@metal oxide heterostructures, finding utilities in photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.

For ZIF-8, this synthesis can be accomplished within minutes under ambient conditions, with an energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal route. By changing the dose of the electron beam a hierarchically porous ZIF-8@ZnO heterostructure can be formed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a distinct family of crystalline porous materials finding extensive applications. Their synthesis often requires elevated temperature and relatively long reaction time. We report here the first case of MOF synthesis activated by high-energy (1.5&#8197;MeV) electron beam radiation from a commercially available electron-accelerator. Using ZIF-8 as a representative for demonstration, this type of synthesis can be accomplished under ambient conditions within minutes, leading to energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal condition. Interestingly, by controlling the absorbed dose in the synthesis, the electron beam not only activates the formation reaction of ZIF-8, but also partially etches the material during the synthesis affording a hierarchical pore architecture and highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF-8. This gives rise to a new strategy to obtain MOF@metal oxide heterostructures, finding utilities in photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Meerwein&#8208;type Bromoarylation with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite more than 80&#8197;years of research, Meerwein haloarylation with complex small molecules has not been possible because the required aryldiazonium salts are often not readily accessible from complex structures. We report the first late stage Meerwein&#8208;type bromoarylation of alkenes with stable arylthianthrenium salts, which provides the opportunity to generate complexity quickly.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalyzed Meerwein&#8208;type bromoarylation of alkenes with stable arylthianthrenium salts, formed by site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thianthrenation. This protocol can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a variety of biomolecules that are difficult to access by other aryl coupling reagents. Halogen introduction allows for a variety of follow&#8208;up transformations, affording numerous biologically active skeletons.

         <title>Removal and Degradation of Microplastics Using the Magnetic and Nanozyme Activities of Bare Iron Oxide Nanoaggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 47, November 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates efficiently adsorb to a variety of common microplastics via hydrogen bonding, allowing full magnetic removal at 1&#8201;% of plastic weight, and complete microplastic degradation due to its nanozyme activity at high temperatures.







Abstract
Removal and degradation of microplastics are often carried out separately. In this work, hydrophilic bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates allowed efficient removal of the most common microplastics including high&#8208;density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Full extraction was achieved using Fe3O4 at 1&#8201;% of the mass of microplastics. Hydrogen bonding is the main force for the adsorption of Fe3O4. Unlike the more commonly used hydrophobically modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the bare Fe3O4 benefitted from the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of its exposed surface, enabling further catalytic degradation of microplastics with nearly 100&#8201;% efficiency and easy recovery of the Fe3O4.

         <title>Programming Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Molecules into Computational Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid (NA) computation has been widely developed in the past years to solve kinds of logic and mathematic issues in both information technologies and biomedical analysis. However, the difficulty to integrate non&#8208;NA molecules limits its power as a universal platform for molecular computation. Here, we report a versatile prototype of hybridized computation integrated with both nucleic acids and non&#8208;NA molecules. Employing the conformationally controlled ligand converters, we demonstrate that non&#8208;NA molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be computed as nucleic acid strands to construct the circuitry with increased complexity and scalability, and can be even programmed to solve arithmetical calculations within the computational nucleic acid system. This study opens a new door for molecular computation in which all&#8208;NA circuits can be expanded with integration of various ligands, and meanwhile, ligands can be precisely programmed by the nuclei acid computation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode in a Dilute Aqueous Electrolyte Enabled by a pH Buffer Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have drawn increasing attention due to the intrinsic safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density. However, parasitic reactions and non&#8208;uniform dendrite growth on the Zn anode side impede their application. Herein, a multifunctional additive, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NHP), is introduced to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions. The results show that the NH4+  tends to be preferably absorbed on the Zn surface to form a &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; and blocks the direct contact of water with Zn. Moreover, NH4+  and (H2PO4)&#8208;  jointly maintain pH values of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the NHP additive enables highly reversible Zn plating/stripping behaviors in Zn//Zn and Zn//Cu cells. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of Zn//MnO2  full cells and Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitors are improved. This work provides an efficient and general strategy for modifying Zn plating/stripping behaviors and suppressing side reactions in mild aqueous electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Enriching Surface&#8208;Accessible CO2 in the Zero&#8208;Gap Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;gap anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based CO2 electrolysis is a promising technology for CO production, however, their performance at elevated current densities still suffers from the low local CO2 concentration due to heavy CO2 neutralization. Herein, via modulating the CO2 feed mode and quantitative analyzing CO2 utilization with the aid of mass transport modeling, we develop a descriptor denoted as the surface&#8208;accessible CO2 concentration ([CO2]SA), which enables us to indicate the transient state of the local [CO2]/[OH&#175;] ratio and helps define the limits of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To enrich the [CO2]SA, we developed three general strategies: (1) increasing catalyst layer thickness, (2) elevating CO2 pressure, and (3) applying a pulsed electrochemical (PE) method. Notably, an optimized PE method allows to keep the [CO2]SA at a high level by utilizing the dynamic balance period of CO2 neutralization. A maximum jCO of 368 &#177; 28 mA cmgeo&#8208;2 was achieved for the commercial silver catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeleton&#8208;Reorganizing Coupling Reactions of Cycloheptatriene and Cycloalkenones with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal reorganization reactions have emerged as an intriguing tool for converting readily available compounds into complicated molecules inaccessible by traditional methods. Herein, we report a unique skeletally reorganized coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenone with amines. In the presence of Rh/acid catalysis, cycloheptatriene can selectively couple with anilines to deliver fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline products. Mechanistic studies indicate that the retro&#8208;Mannich type ring&#8208;opening and subsequent intramolecular Povarov reaction account for the ring&#8208;reorganization. Our mechanistic studies also revealed that skeletally reorganized amination between anilines and cycloalkenones could be obtained by acid. The synthetic utilization of this skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction features a gram&#8208;scale protocol, synthetic derivations, and the late&#8208;stage modification of commercial drugs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient double allene protocol for the formation of benzazocines has been developed. The reaction constitutes a highly regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6+2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable  Z  &#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds.

         <title>Multifunctional Polymer as an Interfacial Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;cation defects and halogen&#8208;anion defects in perovskite film are critical to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a random polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) (PMMA&#8208;AM), was synthesized to serve as an interfacial passivation layer for synergistically passivating the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I of the [PbI6]4&#8208; octahedron. Additionally, the interfacial PMMA&#8208;AM passivation layer can not be destroyed during the hole transport layer deposition because of its low solubility in chlorobenzene. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22 V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000 h of maximum power point tracking. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module was fabricated using this approach, achieving a PCE of 20.64%.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Photo&#8208;Crosslinking and Photo&#8208;Sensitizing Properties for Synthetic Fluorescent Protein Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores have been reported for their singlet state fluorescence properties and applications in bioimaging, but rarely for the triplet state chemistries. Herein, we enabled their photo&#8208;sensitizing and photo&#8208;crosslinking properties through rational modulations. Extension of molecular conjugation and introduction of heavy atoms promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species. Unique from other photosensitizers, these chromophores selectively photo&#8208;crosslinked aggregated proteins and uncovered the interactome profiles. We also exemplified their general applications in chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation, photodynamic therapy and photo induced polymerization. Theoretical calculation, pathway analysis and transient absorption spectra provided mechanistic insights for this triplet state chemistry. Overall, this work expands the function and application of synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores by enabling their triplet excited state properties.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Empowering Zn Electrode Current Capability Along Interfacial Stability by Optimizing Intrinsic Safe Organic Electrolytes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zn is one of the most promising anodes, but its practical application has been hindered by dendritic growth and serious interfacial reactions in conventional electrolytes. Herein, ionic liquids are adopted to prepare intrinsically safe electrolytes via combining with TEP or TMP solvents. With this synergy effect, the blends of TEP/TMP with an IL fraction of ~25 wt% are found to be promising electrolytes, with ionic conductivities comparable to those of standard phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes while electrochemical stabilities are considerably improved; over 1000 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2 and ~350 h at 5.0 mA cm&#8208;2 with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. The use of functionalized IL turns out to be a key factor in enhancing the Zn2+ transport due to the interaction of Zn2+ ions with IL&#8208;zincophilic sites resulting in reduced interfacial resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte upon cycling leading to spongy&#8208;like highly porous, homogenous, and dendrite&#8208;free zinc as an anode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly&#160;Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal (7&#8208;CTA) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of 7&#8208;CTA with vinyl ethers, serve as in&#8208;chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Water as an Initial Proton Source for the Electrochemical CO Reduction Reaction on Copper Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we used in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces under various conditions. Coadsorbed and structure&#8208;/potential&#8208;dependent surface species, including *CO, Cu&#8208;Oad, and Cu&#8208;OHad, were identified using electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope labeling. The relative abundance of *OH follows a &#8216;volcano&#8217; trend with applied potentials in aqueous solutions, which is yet absent in absolute alcoholic solutions.&#160;Combined with DFT calculations, we propose that the surface H2O can serve as a strong proton donor for the first protonation step in both the C1 and C2 pathways of CORR at various applied potentials in alkaline electrolytes, leaving adsorbed *OH on the surface. This work provides fresh insights into the initial protonation steps and identity of key interfacial intermediates formed during CORR on Cu surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra&#8208;stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) is applied to realize dual&#8208;function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven&#8208;membered rings for quasi&#8208;metallic sodium in HC. The as&#8208;formed sodium induces robust NaF&#8208;rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles. This work provides in&#8208;depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>l&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA) catalyses C&#8208;C bond synthesis with moderate diastereoselectivity. Here, with LTA from Cellulosilyticum sp (CpLTA) as an object, a mutability landscape was first constructed by performing saturation mutagenesis at substrate access tunnel amino acids. CAST/ISM strategy was then performed to tune diastereoselectivity. As a result, diastereoselectivity of mutant H305L/Y8H/V143R was improved from 37.2% syn  to 99.4% syn . Besides, diastereoselectivity of mutant H305Y/Y8I/W307E was inverted to 97.2% anti . Based on insights provided by the molecular dynamics simulations and coevolution analysis, the Prelog rule was employed to illustrate diastereoselectivity regulation mechanism of LTA, holding that the asymmetric formation of C&#8208;C bond was caused by electrons attacking the carbonyl carbon atoms of substrate aldehyde from re or si faces. The study would be useful to expand LTA applications and guide engineering of other C&#8208;C bond formation enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1,000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Retarding the Shuttling Ions in the Electrochromic TiO2 with Extensive Crystallographic Imperfections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To understand the role of structure imperfections on the performance of electrochromic transition metal oxide (ETMO) is a fascinating topic yet challenging to design efficient smart windows. Here, we investigate the performance evolution with tunable crystallographic imperfections for rutile TiO  2  nanowire film (TNF). Structure imperfections, originating mainly from the copious oxygen deficiency, are apt to cumulatively retard the shuttling ions, resulting in the response rate for raw TNF less than the half for TNF annealed at 500 &#176;C. We describe ion accommodation sites as a convolution of normal site and abnormal site, in which the normal site performs reversible coloration but the abnormal site contributes only to charge storage, to give a rationale for the non&#8208;linear coloration and rate capability loss. These findings render a clear picture for the ion shuttling process, hence insightful to enhance the electrochromic performance via structure reprogramming.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Activity and Stability in Spinel Cobalt Oxides through Geometrical Sites Occupation towards Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are vitally important to various energy conversion devices. Herein, we introduce elements Ni and Mn into (Co)tet(Co2)octO4 nanosheets (NSs) at fixed geometrical sites, including &#160;Mnoct, Nioct, and Nitet, to optimize the initial geometrical structure and modulate the CoCo2O4 surface from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficiency. The pristine (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 281.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, without damaging their initial activity, the activated (Act)&#8208;(Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs after surface reconstruction exhibit long&#8208;term stability of 100 h under 10 mA cm&#8208;2, 50 mA cm&#8208;2, or even 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The optimal balance between electroactivity and stability leads to remarkable OER performances, providing a pivotal guideline for designing ideal electrocatalysts and inspiring more works to focus on the dynamic change of each occupation site component.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Modulated Enhancements of Proton Conductivity in Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We proposed a new strategy to maximize the density of acidic groups by modulating the electronic effects of the substituents for high&#8208;performance proton conductors. The conductivity of the sulfonated  1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  with methyl group corresponds to 2.25 &#215; 10  &#8208;1  S cm  &#8208;1  at 80  o  C and 90% relative humidity, remarkably an 18600&#8208;fold enhancement over the nonsulfonated  1&#8208;MeL40. 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  maintains long&#8208;term conductivity for one month. We confirm that this synthetic method is generalized to the extended version POPs,  2&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  and  3&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  . In particular, the conductivities of the POPs compete with those of top&#8208;level porous organic conductors. Moreover, the activation energy of the POPs is lower than that of the top&#8208;performing materials. This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long&#8208;term durability of proton&#8208;conducting materials.</dc:description>

This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long-term durability of proton-conducting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its role on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution on improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Light&#8208;Controlled Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a sever challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film&#8217; transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. By gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.</dc:description>
