         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tunable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent chirality, tunability, biocompatibility, and robustness of peptides provide an exciting opportunity for supramolecular chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore uses of peptides in discrete supramolecular systems, how chemists can draw inspiration from larger biological assemblies, and discuss how embracing the complexity of peptide secondary structures in the design of these systems provides opportunities for novel structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function, introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.

         <title>Photocontrolled Release of Urea Enables the Detection of Urea&#8211;Urease Intermediates by Cryo&#8208;FTIR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urease is a fast enzyme, presenting kcat of the order of 103&#8211;104 s&#8722;1. To enable the visualization of its mechanism we explored the technique of cryo&#8208;FTIR. By means of using a ruthenium complex as a caged&#8208;urea, upon light irradiation urea was released and we could see the coordination of the urea to the active site.








Abstract
Caged compounds are a valuable tool to photocontrol the release of enzymatic substrates in a reaction. For example, caged urea molecules were proposed to control urea delivery to urease reactions and aid the determination of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Owing to the success of several caged compounds based on ruthenium complexes, we synthesized a new inorganic caged urea (RuBpy&#8208;urea) and monitored the release of free urea by infrared spectroscopy upon irradiation. Transient infrared absorption (TRIR) indicates diffusion&#8208;controlled release of urea, and kinetics studies after photolysis demonstrate the functionality of the new caged molecule for photocontrolled delivery of urea to urease. Coupling photocontrolled delivery of urea to cryo&#8208;FTIR (fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) revealed that inhibition of urease results in different FTIR spectrum than the one observed for the noninhibited urease.

         <title>Designing New Natural&#8208;Mimetic Phosphatidic Acid: A Versatile and Innovative Synthetic Strategy for Glycerophospholipid Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the role of the fatty acyl chains in biological activities of phosphatidic acids (PA). Several PA probes having two different fatty acyl chains were synthesized through a multi&#8208;steps synthesis and bearing various fluorophores or photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers (PCL). We demonstrate that our probes maintain the biological activities of the natural PA, then we found hundreds of new proteins interacting with PA in function of their chain compositions.








Abstract
Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL&#8208;mediated signaling pathways.

         <title>Controlled Crystallization Kinetics via Conjugated Organic Spacers Enables Ordered Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth strategy is innovatively developed to regulate tin&#8208;based perovskite crystallization kinetics by constructing two&#8208;dimensional growth template for reducing lattice orientational mismatch through energetically unfavorable pathway, yielding desirable facet orientation. Ultimately, the resulting device delivers the highest power conversion efficiency of 14.03% with outstanding reproducibility by two&#8208;step sequential deposition.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced &#960;&#8208;conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)&#8208;dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI2 to pre&#8208;form NEA2SnI4, which subsequently converts to NEA2FASn2I7 and ultimately FASnI3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long&#8208;term stability. Consequently, the NEAI&#8208;based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04&#160;cm2) and 12.44% (1&#160;cm2), representing the record performance for two&#8208;step deposited tin&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin&#8208;based perovskite films, paving the way for high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Cumulene&#8208;Linked Stone&#8208;Wales Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional polymers featuring Stone&#8208;Wales defects and cumulene linkages is demonstrated via thermally and light&#8208;induced reactions on Au(111). STM, nc&#8208;AFM, and Raman spectroscopy, complemented by theory calculations, reveal their chemical structure with a non&#8208;planar geometry, and a distinct electronic bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, underscoring the impact of nonbenzenoid motifs in tuning the properties of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Structural, chemical, and extrinsic modifications of graphene&#8208;based nanostructures enable bandgap tuning, optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum materials design. A well&#8208;known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp2&#8208;hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone&#8208;Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene&#8208;based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on&#8208;surface synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional SW&#8208;based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW&#8208;based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene&#8208;bridged bisanthene analogs.

     alt="On-Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Cumulene-Linked Stone-Wales Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-surface synthesis of one-dimensional polymers featuring Stone-Wales defects and cumulene linkages is demonstrated via thermally and light-induced reactions on Au(111). STM, nc-AFM, and Raman spectroscopy, complemented by theory calculations, reveal their chemical structure with a non-planar geometry, and a distinct electronic bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, underscoring the impact of nonbenzenoid motifs in tuning the properties of carbon-based nanomaterials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural, chemical, and extrinsic modifications of graphene-based nanostructures enable bandgap tuning, optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum materials design. A well-known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone-Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene-based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional SW-based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible-light-induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW-based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene-bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon-based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next-generation optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Light&#8208;Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Hydrogen Iodide Decomposition Over Dual&#8208;Molecular Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunction [(4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4/(4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4], synthesized via a simple one&#8208;pot method, achieves a high H&#8322; evolution rate of 5.26&#160;mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under light and ultrasound, significantly outperforming its individual components. Polarization&#8208;coupled energy&#8208;level alignment and Pb&#8208;I bond&#8208;driven charge transfer enhance directional carrier migration and suppress recombination.








Abstract
Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi&#8208;field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one&#8208;pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4&#8208;difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4/(4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light &#8208;ultrasonic activation. Under dual&#8208;field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4 and (4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy&#8208;level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next&#8208;generation solar&#8208;driven catalysts.

         <title>Functionalized Calix[4]Nanocones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present a synthesis of a nanocone based on a calix[4]arene, which has additional functional groups at the peripheral rims. Due to its rigid structure in combination with alkoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution. It exhibits high selectivity for binding Na+ over Li+ and also K+ in CDCl3.








Abstract
The interest in synthesizing conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) and nanocones has increased recently. Although a number of various structures have been achieved, almost none have additional functional groups at the peripheral rims. Based on a calix[4]arene, a functionalized calix[4]nanocone was synthesized. Due to its rigid structure in combination with methoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution by NMR measurements. The nanocone shows a high selectivity for binding Na+ in favor of Li+ and K+ in CDCl3. By comparing the nanocone with a related but structurally flexible methoxy calix[4]arene, the impact of structural rigidity on selectivity is clearly demonstrated.

         <title>Heterointerface Anchored Ir with Localized Strong Orbital Coupling for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The validity of strong anchoring strategies via heterophase homojunction is uncovered in Ir&#8208;supported catalysts. These localized strong anchoring dramatically improves the operational stability through the controlled microscopic bonding enhancement, and the increased micro&#8208;support interaction generated by the heterointerface optimizes the reactivities of key intermediate species, thus promoting efficient and durable water electrolysis.








Abstract
The imperative to minimize iridium usage in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) process presents a pivotal challenge for hydrogen economy deployment, while inherent destabilization of iridium (Ir) active sites under corrosive operational conditions, originating from insufficient Ir bonding strength, remains a fundamental barrier. Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface&#8208;engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb&#8208;TiO2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic&#8208;scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir&#9472;Osupport bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity&#8208;stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrOx/m&#8208;Nb&#8208;TiO2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mgIr cm&#8722;2), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72&#160;V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm&#8722;2, coupled with unprecedented durability with &lt;1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.

         <title>C60 Fullerene as the Active Site for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal a striking finding: Fullerene (C60), beyond its classical role as an electron buffer, can directly serve as a molecular active site for CO&#8322; reduction. Through data mining, ab initio simulations, and pH&#8211;field coupled microkinetics, we uncover that C60&#8217;s unique curvature induces strong dipole responses, stabilizing COOH* intermediates and enabling a pH&#8208;dependent volcano. This work redefines the catalytic nature of curved carbon materials.








Abstract
Fullerene (C60) was considered as a catalyst promoter in various electrochemical reactions, yet its catalytic role in enhancing catalytic performance beyond electron transfer remains a puzzle to chemists. Traditional simulations imply C60&#8217;s inertness in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to weak interaction with COOH* intermediates. Here, according to a pH&#8208;field coupled microkinetic model at reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, we demonstrate that C60 acts as molecular active sites to facilitate the CO2RR toward CO through a strong binding to COOH* in the electrochemical conditions. This binding is mainly due to the unique structure of C60 that induces large dipole moment changes to stabilize COOH* intermediates across different pH conditions. By detailed comparison of experimental CO2RR observations and quantitative pH&#8208;dependent modeling, this work provides new insights on C60&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting the large dipole moment change upon adsorption at curved surfaces should not be dismissed when analyzing the pH&#8208;dependent binding strength and electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>From Spiropyran to a Circadian&#8208;Responsive Photochromic Supramolecular System for Sustainable Crop Protection: Enhanced Photostability, Biofilm Disintegration, and Foliar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional supramolecular bactericidal material, SpA6(MC)&#8834;CB[8], was fabricated via the self&#8208;assembly of the bioactive spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), exhibiting circadian rhythm responsiveness. This smart supramolecular system effectively disrupts Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) biofilms while demonstrating enhanced foliar affinity, thereby offering a promising strategy for combating bacterial plant diseases.








Abstract
Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single&#8208;structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm&#8208;eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV&#8208;induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6(MC)&#8834;CB[8], a self&#8208;assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day&#8211;night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%). This work establishes a paradigm for developing light&#8208;responsive supramolecular agrochemicals that combine structural dynamism with enhanced functionality, offering sustainable solutions against plant pathogens.

         <title>Zwitterionic Electrolyte Additive for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Ammonium Alkyl Sulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate additive that can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte is developed, which enables kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction, thereby promoting the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species domain interface and excellent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additive is an important component of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. At present, commercial film&#8208;forming additives can only work on either anode or cathode so as to increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the electrolyte. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (TEAPS) additive, which can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. The kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction of TEAPS promotes the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species domain interface, thereby enables greatly improved cycling performance. It is believed that the zwitterionic TEAPS will work as a novel versatile additive for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Interfacial Diffusion&#8208;Reaction Coupling Strategy for CO2 Reduction on Copper Surface in Acidic Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong dipole moment unit, azulene, is used to polarize sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen&#8208;enriched polymer and further enhance CO2 adsorption and transporting on catalytic polycrystalline copper surface. A remarkable Faradaic efficiency of nearly 84% for C2 products has been achieved at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 40&#160;h in acid, reaching the record for CO2 reduction in acidic media.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C2+) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single&#8208;pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong&#8208;polarized layer&#8208;covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp3&#8208;N)&#8208;enriched azulene&#8208;based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO2&#8208;diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84%&#160;C2 Faradaic efficiency at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and demonstrates long&#8208;term stability over 40&#160;h, which is the record for CO2RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene&#8208;polarized sp3&#8208;N&#8208;enriched micro&#8208;environment can increase the local CO2/H2O ratio at electric double&#8208;layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop&#8208;bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong&#8208;polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp3&#8208;N&#8208;enriched micro&#8208;environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO2RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong&#8208;polarized polymers.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Transport in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Through Nanoconfined Triple Phase Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes a new paradigm for leveraging CTBP&#8208;COFs to decouple the competing interactions at the catalyst/PFSA&#8208;ionomer interface, effectively mitigating the poisoning effect of sulfonate groups while enhancing oxygen transport. The strategic incorporation of COFs not only improves catalytic utilization but also reduces interfacial resistance, paving the way for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance fuel cells with significantly reduced platinum loading. 








Abstract
In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple&#8208;phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well&#8208;defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple&#8208;phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen&#8208;enriched transport channels. Under low&#8208;platinum loading conditions (&#8722;0.05&#160;mgPt&#160;cm&#8722;2) in a H2&#9472;O2 PEMFC, the COF&#8208;modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Unprotected &#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#947;&#8208;lactams were successfully synthesized through the coupling of readily available glycine esters with four distinct electrophiles under half&#8208;sandwich chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium aldehyde catalysis. The metal&#8208;centered chirality serves as a crucial element for asymmetric induction.








Abstract
Chiral aldehyde catalysis has emerged as an efficient and step&#8208;economical protocol for constructing unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and related esters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Unprotected &#945;-amino acids and &#947;-lactams were successfully synthesized through the coupling of readily available glycine esters with four distinct electrophiles under half-sandwich chiral-at-ruthenium aldehyde catalysis. The metal-centered chirality serves as a crucial element for asymmetric induction.

         <title>Chemically Cross&#8208;Linked Polybenzimidazole Membranes with Ion&#8208;Conductive Sub&#8208;Nanometer Channels for Zinc&#8211;Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we constructed cross&#8208;linked polybenzimidazole (CL&#8208;PBI) membranes with charged sub&#8208;nanochannels via in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction during dual&#8208;coagulation bath&#8208;induced phase separation process. Guided by &#8220;dehydration&#8211;diffusion&#8221; mechanism associated with steric effects and ion&#8211;pore wall interactions, the as&#8208;prepared CL&#8208;PBI membranes enable fast and selective ion transport under confinement through the precise control of channel size and channel chemistry.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer micropores are essential in various separation processes and energy&#8208;related devices. However, the absence of molecular&#8208;level insights into ion transport behavior in sub&#8208;nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross&#8208;linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom&#8208;scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual&#8208;coagulation bath&#8208;induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion&#8211;pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub&#8208;nanometer channels. Based on &#8220;dehydration&#8211;diffusion&#8221; mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion&#8211;pore wall interactions facilitate low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc&#8211;iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next&#8208;generation ion&#8208;selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.

         <title>Hydrophobic Poly(divinylbenzene) Polymer&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Catalysts for Efficient Hydrogenation of Pyridines in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the pyridine hydrogenation in water is greatly enhanced over the hydrophobic Ru/PDVB catalyst, where nanopores in the PDVB are empty for hydrogen storage, enabling the enrichment of abundant hydrogen around active Ru sites for hydrogenation. 








Abstract
Gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid triphase reactions are limited by poor gas solubility and mass transfer, especially in water. The low solubility of hydrogen in water severely hinders the hydrogenation, therefore requiring high temperature and pressure to increase the activity, which have safety and cost concerns. Herein, we report a hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) polymer&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticle catalyst (Ru/PDVB) with both high activity and excellent stability for the hydrogenation of pyridines in water, even at ambient hydrogen pressure (0.1&#160;MPa). The average turnover frequency (ATOF) of the Ru/PDVB (836.8&#160;mol molRu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is about 6.0 and 768.0&#8208;fold higher than those of traditional Ru/C and commercial Raney Ni catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrophobic polymer prevents filling of water in the nanopores of PDVB, allowing hydrogen enrichment to boost the hydrogenation. This work provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrially important reactions that suffer from poor gas solubility and mass transfer.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in rational DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) design, focusing on fragment&#8208;based DELs, covalent DELs, and focused DELs. These innovations shift DELs from empirical screening to a more strategic, hypothesis&#8208;driven approach, enhancing hit quality and drug discovery efficiency.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have emerged as a powerful and cost&#8208;effective platform for high&#8208;throughput screening, enabling the rapid identification of small&#8208;molecule ligands against a wide range of biological targets. However, traditional DEL approaches often rely on empirical and broad&#8208;based library construction, which can lead to low hit rates, off&#8208;target interactions, and limited chemical diversity around pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Recent technological advances have sought to address these limitations, shifting DELs from a largely blind screening tool to a more rational and precision&#8208;oriented strategy. In this review, we systematically examine the evolution of DEL methodologies, with a particular focus on innovations in library design that enhance hit quality and screening efficiency. Specifically, we highlight the emergence of fragment&#8208;based DEL strategies for exploring chemical space with minimal structures, the incorporation of covalent warheads to enable irreversible binding to specific residues, and the development of focused DELs tailored to particular protein families or binding motifs. Together, these advances mark a shift from blind, empirical screening toward a more strategic and hypothesis&#8208;driven application of DEL technology.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction in Artificial Seawater Electrolyte Catalyzed by Strong&#8208;Acid/Base&#8208;Resistant MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF with strong acid/base resistance can be applied in hectogram&#8208;scale preparation with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g&#8722;1 and enables highly efficient CO2 electroreduction using artificial seawater electrolyte. This work addresses a critical challenge of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction in Na&#8208;based electrolytes during electrochemical CO2RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts for sustainable energy applications.








Abstract
NaCl, a primary component of seawater, is a cost&#8208;effective alternative electrolyte for CO2 electroreduction; however, suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge for efficient CO2RR. Herein, a novel Zn&#8208;MOF {[Zn5(tz)6(HCOO)4]&#183;2H2O}n (1, Htz&#160;=&#160;1,2,3&#8208;triazole) was prepared, exhibiting excellent stability in 0.5&#160;M NaCl electrolyte for 16 weeks. 1 could maintain crystalline structure even after exposure to 9&#160;M HCl and 2&#160;M NaOH solutions. 1 achieved high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 94.4% under &#8722;1.5&#160;V in artificial seawater electrolyte and 91.1% FECO in treated natural seawater under &#8722;0.8&#160;V, maintaining performance over 20&#160;h. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H2O in [Na(H2O)5]+ to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram&#8208;scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405&#160;g&#8722;1, showing promising industrial potential in CO2RR. This work addresses a critical challenge of the strongly competitive HER in Na&#8208;based electrolytes during electrochemical CO2RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and economical catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Glycoconjugated Metallohelices Eliminate Cancer Stem&#8208;Like Cells via Modulating G&#8208;Quadruplex Surrounding Transcriptional Start Site of Sox2 Gene</title>

Glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) targeted G&#8208;quadruplex surrounding the transcriptional start site of Sox2 gene to eradicate breast cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs) by inhibiting cell viability and stemness.








Abstract
As an important pluripotency transcription factor, Sox2 plays key roles in the stemness maintenance of cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs). Here, we found that a highly conserved G&#8208;rich region surrounding transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of Sox2 gene can form G&#8208;quadruplex (Sox2G4) both in vitro and in cells. More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) rather than &#923;&#8208;f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that &#916;&#8208;f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes of pluripotency genes can regulate the fates of CSCs. Our work provides a new way to target CSC gene and eradicate cancer stem cells.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophenes from Pyridines Using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophenes can be disconnected to pyridines through a novel formal [4&#160;+&#160;1] treatment of Zincke ketones with elemental sulfur. In situ ring&#8208;opening of the &#960;&#8208;deficient heteroarene gives an extended diene, which undergoes simple reaction with octasulfur to give the &#960;&#8208;excessive thiophene.








Abstract
We describe a skeletal editing of pyridines to afford thiophenes through a formal [4&#160;+&#160;1] reaction using elemental sulfur. 2&#8208;Arylpyridines are converted to ring&#8208;opened aza&#8208;triene Zincke ketone structures, followed by simple treatment with sulfur to give 2&#8208;aroylthiophene products directly. The amphiphilic character of octasulfur enables smooth reaction with the Zincke dienamine, affording the cyclized products under mild and neutral conditions. We illustrate this new disconnection with a synthesis of the anti&#8208;inflammatory drug suprofen from a pyridine starting material.

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Driven Efficient Ammonia Synthesis by Facilitating *NOOH Formation and Balancing *H Supply</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pulsed electrocatalysis, a Janus Cu@Co/NC catalyst achieves highly efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by facilitating *NOOH formation and balancing *H supply. Specifically, the Cu sites can activate NO3&#8722; at low overpotentials, while the Co sites can facilitate *NOOH formation with sufficient *H provided by the Co sites at high overpotentials.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction emerges as a promising approach for ammonia generation; however, its efficiency is hindered by the sluggish hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates and limited active hydrogen supply at constant applied potentials. Driven by the pulsed electrocatalysis, in this work, efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion is realized by facilitating *NOOH formation and balancing *H supply on a Janus Cu@Co/NC electrocatalyst. In detail, the Cu sites could activate NO3&#8722; at low overpotentials, while the Co sites could facilitate *NOOH formation with sufficient *H provided by the Co sites at high overpotentials. Promoted by the pulsed electrocatalysis technique, a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 98.32% with NH3 yield rate of 12.75 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 is attained, and the scaled&#8208;up pulsed electrosynthesis at industrial current densities is also achieved. This work underlines the feasibility of pulsed electrolysis for regulating intermediate hydrogenation, offering a promising approach for the synthesis of ammonia or other important chemicals.

         <title>Understanding Optical Properties and Electronic Structures of High&#8208;Entropy Alloyed Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy perovskite (HEP) nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized and their anomalous optical and electronic signatures are characterized by temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical measurements, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. Despite the smaller size of HEP NCs than the Bohr diameter of pristine NCs, they possess wider bandgaps and featureless band structures due to the formation of shallow states. In situ luminescence analysis further demonstrates the superior photostability of HEP NCs thin films.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloying (HEA) has emerged as a prominent strategy to modulate physiochemical properties of nanomaterials. Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA&#8208;induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high&#8208;entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B&#8208;site elements (Pb2+, Sr2&#8314;, Ca2&#8314;, Cd2&#8314;, and Mg2&#8314;). High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr3 NCs (&#8764;7&#160;nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band&#8208;edge shallow states. We show that these HEA&#8208;induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA&#8208;induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit Effects in a Thallium Borohydride Stabilized by Coordination to Bis(diisopropylamino)Cyclopropenylidene (BAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong donor ability of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) helps stabilize the first reported thallium borohydride, [Tl(BAC)(&#956;&#8208;H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN)]2 ([H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9&#8208;boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane). According to density functional theory, its hydride resonance is calculated to exhibit a 3.9 downfield shift due to spin&#8211;orbit (SO) effects from the adjacent Tl center. This SO shift is evidence for Tl(6p)&#8208;H(1s) orbital mixing.








Abstract
Reaction of Tl(OTf) with 2 equiv of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)2(OTf)] (1) in moderate yields. Subsequent reaction of 1 with [K][H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN] ([H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9&#8208;boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)(&#956;&#8208;H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN)]2 (3), also in moderate yield. Complex 3 is the first reported thallium borohydride. We attribute its thermal stability to the strong donor ability of the BAC co&#8208;ligand. Both 1 and 3 exhibit trigonal pyramidal geometries about Tl+ in the solid&#8208;state, indicative of the presence of stereochemically active lone pairs.

     alt="Spin-Orbit Effects in a Thallium Borohydride Stabilized by Coordination to Bis(diisopropylamino)Cyclopropenylidene (BAC)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong donor ability of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) helps stabilize the first reported thallium borohydride, [Tl(BAC)(&#956;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9-boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane). According to density functional theory, its hydride resonance is calculated to exhibit a 3.9 downfield shift due to spin&#8211;orbit (SO) effects from the adjacent Tl center. This SO shift is evidence for Tl(6p)-H(1s) orbital mixing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of Tl(OTf) with 2 equiv of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OTf)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) in moderate yields. Subsequent reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with [K][H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN] ([H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9-boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)(&#956;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), also in moderate yield. Complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is the first reported thallium borohydride. We attribute its thermal stability to the strong donor ability of the BAC co-ligand. Both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibit trigonal pyramidal geometries about Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the solid-state, indicative of the presence of stereochemically active lone pairs. The hydride environment in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is calculated to exhibit a 3.9&#160;ppm downfield shift attributed to spin-orbit effects from the adjacent Tl center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Mechanical Response of Polymers via Metal Induced Coordination Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers containing edta groups can bind metal ions in an intrachain manner that results in &#8220;microrigidification&#8221; of the polymer backbone and subsequent changes in mechanical characteristics.








Abstract
The modulation of mechanical properties in polymers with metal binding ligands has largely been achieved via crosslinking between polymer chains induced by metal ion binding to pendant or end ligating groups. In this work, incorporation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H4edta) into the main chain backbone of flexible, linear polymers results in substantial modulation of mechanical properties via conformational changes in the imbedded ligand within the polymer backbone induced by metal ion binding. Upon the addition of metal ions, these polymers transform from viscous liquids into solids with improved elastic characteristics. Polymer strength and toughness are significantly enhanced without the need for extensive polymer crosslinking. This approach represents a new paradigm in using metal ions to modulate the mechanical properties of organic polymers.

         <title>Anisotropy of Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductors in Photo(electro)Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes how crystallographic anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors governs light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions, offering mechanistic insights and design guidelines for high&#8208;performance photo(electro)catalysts through material synthesis, theoretical modeling, and advanced characterization techniques.








Abstract
Anisotropy in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors has emerged as a key design principle for understanding and advancing photo(electro)catalytic systems. The exposure of well&#8208;defined facets in single&#8208;crystal semiconductors introduces anisotropic variations in atomic coordination, electronic structure, and surface energetics, giving rise to directional charge transport and facet&#8208;specific reactivity. Such intrinsic differences coordinate the entire photocatalytic process, from charge excitation and separation to interfacial reaction kinetics. In this regard, effective utilization of anisotropy requires clarifying its impact on electronic structure, charge transport, and interfacial reactivity, along with its sensitivity to microenvironmental changes under realistic operando conditions. In this review article, we systematically examine the role of crystallographic anisotropy in light harvesting, charge carrier dynamics, and surface reactivity. We summarize recent advances in anisotropic material design, trace the evolution of the concept, and provide mechanistic insights based on experimental studies, theoretical models, and advanced characterization techniques. We further discuss current challenges and propose strategies to guide the rational application of anisotropy in catalyst design, aiming to expand its scope across a broader range of photo(electro)catalytic systems.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials for Amplification and Dynamic Modulation of Chiral Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently chiral bimetallic cluster aggregates were synthesized using a simple methodology. The introduction of both chiral and achiral additives during synthesis resulted in reversed and amplified chiroptical responses, along with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission. A remarkably high absorption and emission dissymmetry factor of (&#177;)0.05 was achieved, opening newer avenues in the field.








Abstract
Chiral metal clusters have garnered significant research interest in recent years due to their unique photophysical and chiroptical properties. Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)&#8211;silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster&#8208;assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology&#8208;dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (&#177;)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited&#8208;state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light&#8208;emitting materials.

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks Through Repulsion&#8208;Torsion Effect: Prominent 1D Above 2D and 3D Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study for the first time synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through the repulsion&#8208;torsion effect. The charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D&#160;&gt;&#160;3D&#160;&gt;&#160;2D.








Abstract
Exploring the impact of different dimensions on the properties and functions of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has always been a key goal, as this can provide feedback to assist in the design of advanced COFs. However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one&#8208;dimensional (1D), two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion&#8208;torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion&#8208;torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non&#8208;planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion&#8208;torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D&#160;&gt;&#160;3D&#160;&gt;&#160;2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.

         <title>Multiaxial Aromatic&#8208;Based Photoferroelectric Induced by Synergistic Intermolecular Interactions for Multidirectional Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic&#8208;based photoferroelectric, (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium)2PbBr4, through synergistic noncovalent interactions between hydrogen bonding and fluorine&#8208;&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. The polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection behavior, demonstrating the potential for next&#8208;generation flexible and thin&#8208;film integrated devices.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics coupling spontaneous polarization and remarkable semiconductor attributes have emerged as promising candidates for self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic&#8208;based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ)2PbBr4 (4Br2FBZ = 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine&#8208;&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. Notably, the aromatic cations rotate driven by synergistic molecular interactions to form a T&#8208;shaped stacking architecture, resembling interlocking puzzle pieces. This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ)2PbBr4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48&#160;&#181;C cm&#8722;2 and a high Curie temperature of 408&#160;K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), and exceptional detection stability. Strikingly, the polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits excellent self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection behavior due to its biaxial ferroelectricity, indicating the potential for next&#8208;generation flexible and thin&#8208;film integrated devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoferroelectrics coupling spontaneous polarization and remarkable semiconductor attributes have emerged as promising candidates for self-powered X-ray detection. However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic-based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (4Br2FBZ = 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine-&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection.

         <title>Engineering PdAu/CeO&#8322; Alloy/Oxide Interfaces for Selective Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion at 500&#160;K over Pd0.3Au0.7/CeO2. The synergistic interaction between alloyed Pd&#8211;Au sites and the CeO2 support enhances catalytic performance, enabling highly selective methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol under mild conditions. The reaction of CH4 with H2O produces CH3OH and H2, achieving &#8764;80% selectivity under mild conditions while maintaining stable long&#8208;term activity.








Abstract
The direct conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol remains a critical challenge in methane valorization. In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd0.3Au0.7/CeO2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (&#8764;80%) at 500&#160;K with a 1:1 methane&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. While Pd/CeO2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over&#8208;reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO&#8322; composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine&#8208;tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.

         <title>Bulk&#8208; and Surface&#8208;Engineered Carbon Nitride with Promoted Electron Transfer for NADH Regeneration and Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a rhodium complex&#8208;immobilized porous carbon nitride (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a bulk&#8208; and surface&#8208;engineering strategy. The optimized Rh*&#8208;PCN showed a maximum initial reaction rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1 for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. By integrating Rh*&#8208;PCN with glutamate dehydrogenase, we established an enzyme&#8208;photo&#8208;coupled catalytic system capable of driving artificial photosynthesis for L&#8208;glutamate production.








Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN), a well&#8208;known photocatalyst, has been extensively utilized in light&#8208;driven redox reactions, including NADH regeneration. However, its catalytic efficiency is hindered by rapid charge recombination due to obstructed electron transfer. Herein, we developed a highly porous CN coated with a thin layer of rhodium complex (Rh*&#8208;PCN) through a combination of bulk and surface engineering for enhanced NADH regeneration. The bulk&#8208;engineered porous network of PCN facilitates oriented electron transfer in Rh*&#8208;PCN, while the surface&#8208;engineered Rh layer minimizes the electron transfer distance between PCN and the rhodium complex. Rh*&#8208;PCN achieves an initial NADH regeneration rate of 16.80&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185;. Moreover, Rh*&#8208;PCN suppresses enzyme deactivation by compartmentalizing the enzyme from the photogenerated holes on PCN and the rhodium complex. When integrated with glutamate dehydrogenase, the Rh*&#8208;PCN/enzyme coupled system produces L&#8208;glutamic acid.

         <title>Pyridine Nitrogen Decorated Carbon Support for High&#8208;Performance Seawater Electrolyte&#8208;Based Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support loaded Fe single&#8208;atom sites to improve the oxygen reduction reaction performance in seawater electrolyte. The study reveals that the pyridinic nitrogen in situ constructs a localized negatively charged interface during the reaction process, which effectively blocks the attack of Cl&#8315; from seawater on both the carbon support and active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic stability.








Abstract
Developing high specific energy seawater electrolyte&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries (SZABs) is crucial for marine energy supply systems. However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl&#8722; in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst [Fe&#8208;SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe&#8208;SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential (Eonset) and halfwave potential (E1/2) of 1.174 and 0.907&#160;V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (Eonset: 0.972&#160;V, E1/2: 0.848&#160;V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 800&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl&#8722; adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.

         <title>Unconventional Fast Room Temperature Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Single Crystals Unveiling Precise Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a fast, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline, highly fluorinated 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). We achieved the growth of 3&#8208;micron&#8208;long COF rods, enabling the precise study of their mechanical properties and aggregation states. The crystallization process was computationally elucidated, revealing the critical roles of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroaniline in promoting Schiff base bond formation and improving COF crystallinity. This study offers new insights into the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs, with implications for their use in a range of advanced materials applications.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a special kind of crystalline polymers produced by the polycondensation reaction of organic linkers. However, the polymerization is often uncontrolled and conventionally yields polycrystalline powders. For that reason, the development of new methods to obtain single&#8208;crystalline COFs is an urgent need. Herein, we report a modulated, room&#8208;temperature, and fast synthesis of a highly fluorinated COF where the reaction conditions were systematically analyzed to yield single&#8208;crystalline rods of around three microns. The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF. This study reveals new insights into the crystallization of high&#8208;quality 2D COFs.

     alt="Unconventional Fast Room Temperature Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Single Crystals Unveiling Precise Structural Insights"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents a fast, room-temperature synthesis of single-crystalline, highly fluorinated 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). We achieved the growth of 3-micron-long COF rods, enabling the precise study of their mechanical properties and aggregation states. The crystallization process was computationally elucidated, revealing the critical roles of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroaniline in promoting Schiff base bond formation and improving COF crystallinity. This study offers new insights into the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs, with implications for their use in a range of advanced materials applications.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a special kind of crystalline polymers produced by the polycondensation reaction of organic linkers. However, the polymerization is often uncontrolled and conventionally yields polycrystalline powders. For that reason, the development of new methods to obtain single-crystalline COFs is an urgent need. Herein, we report a modulated, room-temperature, and fast synthesis of a highly fluorinated COF where the reaction conditions were systematically analyzed to yield single-crystalline rods of around three microns. The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF. This study reveals new insights into the crystallization of high-quality 2D COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Direct Levulinate Hydrodeoxygenation to Pentanoic Biofuels over La&#8208;Modulated Ru&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the vital roles of La modification in metal&#8208;zeolite bifunctional catalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in the direct hydrodeoxygenation of biomass&#8208;derived ethyl levulinate into pentanoate biofuels. Optimal La modulation can maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites for enhancing the activity, and attenuate the acid strength for efficiently suppressing the secondary reactions.








Abstract
Disentangling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates has been a great challenge in biomass valorization and related tandem catalysis, by virtue of involving a series of reactions in parallel and in cascade. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of La modulation for Ru&#8208;zeolite combinations in the case of direct HDO of neat ethyl levulinate (EL) into ethyl pentanoate (EP). An unprecedented EP yield of 80% and an EP turnover rate (TOR) of 224 molEP&#183;molRu&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, together with excellent stability, were obtained for the optimal Ru/2.8La&#8208;Y catalyst for the first time, compared to the current reported &#8220;performance ceiling&#8221; of EP yields of &lt;40% and EP TORs of &lt;120 molEP&#183;molmetal&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under similar conditions. Optimal La modulation could maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites and efficiently attenuate the acid strength, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity in the direct HDO of EL into EP while suppressing the further hydrolysis reactions that consume EP. This study provides an effective approach to regulate the acid properties of metal&#8208;zeolite bifunctional catalysts, in particular in mediation of compromise in acid density and acid strength factors, for breaking the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in biomass valorization and beyond.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Reconstruction of Cation&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched Ni@Ni2P Particles in Hollow N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers&#8208;encapsulated defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP particles are rationally synthesized for efficient catalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, where the in situ electrochemical reconstruction induces the formation of new active Ni(OH)2 species. 








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions is promising to promote the artificial nitrogen cycling. Despite the development of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts, their incident in situ electrochemical reconstruction always leads to the ambiguity of veritable active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report an approach to encapsulate Ni@Ni2P particles with cationic Ni vacancies in hollow N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (designated Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and have investigated their surface reconstruction and reaction mechanisms using various in situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations. Specially, the regulation of cationic Ni vacancy concentration in the three defective Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs catalysts leads to the 3.92&#8208;fold NH3 yield rate difference at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE. During the electrocatalytic reaction process, new amorphous Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH species form on the surface of Ni@Ni2&#8208;xP@N&#8208;CNFs and the stable amorphous Ni(OH)2 species benefits the generation of more active hydrogen (*H) for hydrogenation with NO3&#8722;. This is further verified by the different reaction rate&#8208;determining steps on the pristine and reconstructed defective catalysts. Integration of the optimized defective catalyst as cathode into a stable aqueous Zn&#8211;NO3&#8211;battery provides high power density and Faraday efficiency for NH3.

         <title>Developing HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Chemical Inducers of Dimerization to Probe Receptor Oligomerization and Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling protein interactions is key to studying signaling. Antibody methods have limits, but chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) using HaloTags and SNAP&#8208;Tags offer precise control. We present CIDs to covalently link heteromers with varied linkers and a FRET&#8208;based sensor. Applied to different tagged cell surface receptors, this allows study of proximity&#8208;induced, ligand&#8208;independent&#160;signaling, including an inherent optical readout.








Abstract
Controlling protein&#8211;protein interactions is critical for dissecting signaling pathways, especially those initiated by ligand&#8208;receptor interactions, which alter receptor oligomerization and drive downstream signaling cascades. Traditional methods for driving protein&#8211;protein complexes use antibodies that face limitations in terms of stoichiometry, geometric rigidity, and antibody specificity. Chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs) for fusion proteins such as HaloTag (Halo) and SNAP&#8208;Tags (SNAP) offer precise and covalent control of protein proximities, overcoming limitations of antibody&#8208;dependent methods. In this study, we expand the toolkit of Halo and SNAP CIDs with (1) benzylguanine (BG) and HaloTag ligand (HTL) crosslinkers featuring varying polyethylene glycol linker lengths and update this kit with (2) a FRET&#8208;based dimerizing sensor to induce and verify protein proximity. Here we establish our CIDs on extracellularly Halo&#8208; and SNAP&#8208;tagged TGF&#946;, BMP, neurotrophic factor, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby elucidating the signaling potential of ligand&#8208;independent dimerization in a heteromeric fashion.

         <title>S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn Alloy Hollow Microbox for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under cathodic potential, Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 hollow microboxes undergo in&#8208;situ reduction and reconstruction to form S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy hollow microboxes, which greatly promote the electrochemical CO&#8322;RR to produce formate.








Abstract
The dynamic catalyst's restructuring creates a new catalytic surface that is essential for boosting the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work, we synthesize Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 hollow microboxes using a coprecipitation method followed by a hydrothermal treatment. Based on a collection of in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations including in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, rapid freeze&#8208;quench (RFQ) 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2 (Ag@SnS2) hollow microboxes undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO2RR, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of S&#8208;doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy (S&#8208;Ag3Sn/Sn) hollow microboxes. This transformation results in a remarkable formate selectivity of 92.4% with a formate partial current density of 97.3 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in an H&#8208;cell. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both S&#8208;doping and Ag&#8211;Sn alloying enhance the CO2 adsorption and improve the stability of *OCHO intermediate. This work offers a facile strategy for designing highly active and selective electrocatalyst for CO2RR.

Based on a collection of in-situ/ex-situ characterizations including in-situ Raman spectroscopy, rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) &lt;sup&gt;119&lt;/sup&gt;Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag-decorated SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ag@SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) hollow microboxes undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, leading to the in-situ formation of S-doped Ag&#8211;Sn alloy (S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn/Sn) hollow microboxes. This transformation results in a remarkable formate selectivity of 92.4% with a formate partial current density of 97.3 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in an H-cell. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both S-doping and Ag&#8211;Sn alloying enhance the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and improve the stability of *OCHO intermediate. This work offers a facile strategy for designing highly active and selective electrocatalyst for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Arsenium Ion Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The release of ring strain in cyclo&#8208;Pn3 (Pn&#160;= P, As) ligands is exploited to achieve insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ (R&#160;=&#160;organic substituent) into non&#8208;polar bonds. This concept is utilized to access complexes bearing exotic cyclo&#8208;Pn3AsR2 ligands. Quantum crystallography and computational analysis shed light on the key energetic contributions unlocking this fundamental mode of reactivity.








Abstract
Although it marks a cornerstone of pnictogenium ion [R2Pn]+ reactivity, the insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ into non&#8208;polar bonds remains highly challenging. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed, which circumvents the limitations of insertion reactivity of [R2As]+ (e.g., formal redox state of&#160;+V at As) via alleviation of ring strain in the substrate. Thus, unlocking arsenium ion bond insertion delivers the ring&#8208;expanded complexes [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8208;Pn3AsCy2][TEF] ({LnM}&#160;=&#160;Cp&#8244;Ni, Pn&#160;= P (1); {LnM}&#160;=&#160;{CpMo(CO)2}, Pn&#160;= P (2), As (5); Cp&#8244;&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;tBu3C5H2, [TEF]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;). Computational analysis of the reaction mechanism and quantum crystallographic investigation of 1 highlight the release of ring strain as the crucial driving force for this reactivity. This rational is corroborated by the isolation of the arsenium ion coordinated [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;P2AsCy2)][TEF] (3) as well as the phosphenium ion inserted [{CpMo(CO)2}(&#951;3&#8208;As3PPh2)][TEF] (4).

         <title>Electrochemical Alkyl Displacement of Thioethers for Streamlined Trideuteromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach has been developed for late&#8208;stage direct trideuteromethyl incorporation into thioethers by using stoichiometric methanol&#8208;d4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source. Mechanistic studies showed that the sulfonium salt generated in situ is the key intermediate. Control experiments revealed that in situ generation of the sulfonium and its subsequent reduction at the cathode is the key to alkyl displacement and precise late&#8208;stage trideuteration.








Abstract
Deuterated compounds exhibit significant pharmacokinetic advantages and have been widely applied in drug discovery. Trideuteromethyl&#8208;containing compounds represent a substantial portion of both approved deuterated drugs and those in development. Traditional approaches to incorporate trideuterated methyl group with trideuterated methyl sources (such as iodomethane&#8208;d3, dimethyl sulfate&#8208;d6) require preactivated synthetic precursor, limiting the application for the late&#8208;stage trideuteromethyl group incorporation of pharmaceutical molecules. Herein, we develop an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage trideuteromethyl incorporation of thioether by using stoichiometric methanol&#8208;d4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source via a sulfide alkyl displacement. This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram&#8208;scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in&#8208;situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate. A series of control experiments reveals that alkanes as the departing moiety are the key to alkyl displacement and precise late&#8208;stage trideuteration.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Sulfide Separation from Carbon Dioxide Achieved by Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids for Natural Gas Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient separation of H2S from CO2 remains a pivotal challenge in natural gas upgrading. This work pioneers a cascade H2S sorption mechanism enabled by carbonyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids, achieving unprecedented H2S capacity and record&#8208;high H2S/CO2 selectivity, which sets a groundbreaking benchmark for H2S/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H2S from CO2, another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H2S from CH4, the selective removal of H2S from CO2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H2S, departing from conventional acid&#8208;base interaction&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H2S. Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H2S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H2S into [HS]&#8315; species. The unique cascade H2S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H2S, endowing the [6ca]&#8208;derived ILs with unprecedented high H2S capacities and record&#8208;breaking H2S/CO2 selectivities (67&#8211;89 at 1.0&#160;bar and 229&#8211;319 at 0.1&#160;bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy&#8208;efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H2S/CO2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.

         <title>Reversible Structural Oscillation Mediates Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

This study reveals that dynamic structural oscillations within the [Ni&#8211;O2&#8211;Fe] units of NiFe LDHs identified a strong dependence on the alternating active Fe dissolution and redeposition, thus mediating the dynamic stability. Further, engineering the oscillation manners via the in situ sulfur leaching and cobalt&#8208;induced electron&#8208;withdrawing effects achieves unprecedented industrial&#8208;scale durability (&gt;800&#160;h @ 8000&#160;mA) and a record energy efficiency (4.05&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 at 4000 A m&#8722;2).








Abstract
The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues, thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni&#8211;O2&#8211;Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy with S, Co co&#8208;doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co&#8211;O2&#8211;Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800&#160;h (5000&#8208;h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 @ 4000 A m&#8722;2. The levelized cost of hydrogen of US$ 2.315 per kgH2 overmatches the European Commission's target for the coming decade (&lt;US$ 2.5 per kgH2).

         <title>Multisite Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Facilitates Oxidative Photocatalysis in a Molecular Zr&#8208;Based Coordination Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of the hydroxy ligand in the Zr3(O)(OH)3 nodes of a molecular cage unlocks photo&#8208;oxidative catalysis via multisite proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), complementing previous findings in the reductive counterpart. This platform offers valuable insights into the excited&#8208;state reactivity of photoredox catalysts and stands as a promising tool with unprecedented ambipolar reactivity for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
The development of mediators that harness visible light to drive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) offers a promising pathway to achieving challenging redox transformations in a more sustainable manner and with enhanced thermochemical efficiency. However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited&#8208;state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr&#8323;(O)(OH)&#8323; nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O&#9472;H and C&#9472;H bonds (70&#8211;100 kcal mol&#8315;1). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground&#8208;state, pre&#8208;association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedented ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteins are typically not cell&#8208;permeable, making intracellular delivery a significant challenge. The cover image illustrates the model protein RNase A, which is transiently modified with polyarginine chains (orange) attached to lysine residues. In combination with the CPP&#8208;Additive technology, the resulting bioconjugate is able to translocate across the lipid membrane of human cells. Details are reported in the Research Article (e202506802) by Christian Hackenberger et&#160;al.

         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;like fluorescent molecular tracker is designed to make dynamic polymerization processes visible and colorful. In their Research Article (e202507770), Qi Zhang and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of a conformationally flipping fluorescent dye that senses subtle microenvironmental changes and emits multicolor fluorescence to visualize the dynamics in reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides. This molecular optical tool enables a real&#8208;time and sensitive way to monitor polymeric systems.

         <title>Scalable Hyperpolarized MRI Enabled by Ace&#8208;SABRE of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ace&#8208;SABRE overcomes previous biocompatibility challenges associated with the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) hyperpolarization technique. The employed acetone&#8211;water mixtures greatly simplify separation of the hyperpolarized compound (e.g., pyruvate) from solvents and catalysts delivering a biocompatible injectable. Ace&#8208;SABRE retains high polarization during processing and enables effective metabolic characterization&#160;in vivo.








Abstract
Hyperpolarized (HP) MRI using [1&#8211;13C]pyruvate is emerging as a promising molecular imaging approach. Among hyperpolarization methods, Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is attractive because SABRE polarizes the substrates directly in room&#8208;temperature solutions avoiding complex hardware. Most SABRE experiments have historically been performed in methanol, a relatively toxic and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;remove solvent. Here we demonstrate the use of a 80/20 acetone/water (A/W) solvent system (Ace&#8208;SABRE) to provide hyperpolarized [1&#8211;13C]pyruvate with up to 17% polarization, then implement a solvent processing protocol to achieve injectable solutions retaining 74% of the initial polarization, and lastly we demonstrate HP in vivo spectroscopy and imaging using the Ace&#8208;SABRE platform to showcase metabolic tracking in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor as well as HP&#8208;MRI, both in direct comparison to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) experiments. The Ace&#8208;SABRE technique promises faster adoption of SABRE hyperpolarization in biological experiments, overall lowering the barriers to entry for HP&#8208;NMR and HP&#8208;MRI.

         <title>Chloromethoxytrityls: Tuning the SOMO Level of Stable Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we use chlorine and methoxy groups to control the singly occupied molecular orbital level of triarylmethyl radicals within a wide range of 1.8&#160;eV and establish structure&#8208;properties relationships between the substituents and photophysical properties of triarylmethyl radicals.








Abstract
Luminescent radicals are of significant recent interest because of the unique quantum properties of the doublet excited state. Control of the energy level of the singly&#8208;occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open&#8208;shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron&#8208;poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of &#8211;5.7 to &#8211;3.9&#160;eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one&#8208;electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO &#8804; &#8208;4.5&#160;eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled&#8208;cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open&#8208;shell species.

         <title>Feedstock&#8208;Derived Thiophene Radical Anions Exhibiting Redox Stability at Extreme Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although organic redox systems are emerging as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, stability at high cell voltage is often achieved at the expense of synthetic accessibility. Here, we isolate and characterize a feedstock&#8208;derived thiophene radical anion bearing simple ester groups. Despite a minimalist design, the radical and its derivatives are stable at extreme potentials, enabling their use as readily accessible electrolytes for electron storage.








Abstract
Organic radicals that are both readily synthesized from commodity chemicals and stable at extreme redox potentials are rare, yet highly desirable for applications in energy storage and organic electronics. Herein, we report feedstock&#8208;derived thiophene radical anions bearing ester functionalities that undergo galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge redox cycling at potentials below &#8722;2&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+ (Fc&#160;=&#160;ferrocene). Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low&#8208;cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced &#8220;quinoidal&#8221; thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.

         <title>Design of Tough 3D Printable Elastomers with Human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates how machine learning, guided by human expertise, can accelerate materials discovery. We developed a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop reinforcement learning approach that identified high performing 3D&#8208;printable elastomers. We discovered materials with double the average toughness of empirically discovered elastomers, and we identified structure&#8208;property relationships to guide future polymer design.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance elastomers for additive manufacturing requires overcoming complex property trade&#8208;offs that challenge conventional material discovery pipelines. Here, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress&#8211;strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi&#8208;component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (&gt;10&#160;MPa) and high strain at break (&gt;200%). Analysis of the high&#8208;performing materials revealed structure&#8208;property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine&#8208;guided, human&#8208;augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi&#8208;objective materials optimization.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Packing Mode Variations and Chirality Inversion in Short Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports subtle pH&#8208;dependent chirality inversions through designed amphiphilic peptides. The underlying mechanism is revealed to be closely related to the protonation state of the hydrophilic His residue. The protonated His promotes antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing and left&#8208;handed fibril assembly, whereas the deprotonated His facilitates parallel packing and right&#8208;handed fibril assembly, driven by interstrand His&#8211;His interactions.








Abstract
Precise control of structures and morphologies in peptide self&#8208;assembly has been challenging. We report the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptides I3H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C&#8208;terminal histidine&#8208;based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self&#8208;assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH&#8208;dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of &#946;&#8208;strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH&#8208;dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I3GH assembly maintaining this effect while I3GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual &#946;&#8208;sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side&#8208;chain interactions.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalysed Hydrofluorination of Alkynes at Room Temperature Promoted by a Fluoride Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an air and moisture tolerant platinum&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination system that gives selectively (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes. Experimental and computational investigation on the mechanism allowed for the identification of catalytic species. The hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF, resulting into BF3, PF5 and HF serving as fluoride shuttles.








Abstract
Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic &#223;&#8208;fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF3, HF as well as PF5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer&#8208;sphere fluorination of the metal&#8208;bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.

         <title>Insight into how PETase Functions at the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface and an Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable plastic recycling. This study systematically elucidates the catalytic pathway of PET biodegradation, from enzyme adsorption and substrate recognition to ester bond cleavage. A rational enzyme design principle is proposed to balance catalytic activity and stability, providing guidelines for developing efficient plastic&#8208;degrading biocatalysts.








Abstract
Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has garnered considerable interest in plastic recycling efforts. However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase&#8208;catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid&#8208;liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET&#8208;binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.

         <title>Establishing 3d&#8211;4d Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The d&#8208;d hybridization between 3d and 4d metals can induce the modulation of the affinity of *CO intermediate, thereby accelerating the *CO hydrogenation process in photothermal CO2 methanation.








Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion offers a promising way to address the energy and environmental issues; however, the development of self&#8208;supporting catalysts with high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self&#8208;supporting carbon cloth with N&#8208;doped carbon arrays (PdCo&#8208;NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3d&#8208;4d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz2&#8208;5&#963; and dyz&#8208;2&#960;* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self&#8208;supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO2 methanation while serving as a photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat converter to improve the temperature of the reaction system. As a result, PdCo&#8208;NC/CC exhibits unprecedented photothermal performance toward CO2 methanation, delivering a CH4 generation rate as high as 15.23&#160;mol gmetal&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100&#160;h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo&#8208;NC/CC in CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Stable Porous Organic Salts via Suppressed Proton Integration Using Fluorinated Tetrazole Tectons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts featuring hydrophobic channels and minimal hydrogen bonding were constructed using a fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra&#8208;substituted imidazole precursor lacking active protons as the base. These materials exhibited exceptional robustness and structural integrity under both aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions, maintaining their stacking mode and crystal structure even at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid&#8211;base neutralization (e.g., &#9472;SO&#8323;H and &#9472;NH&#8322;) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water&#8208;lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra&#8208;substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation&#8211;anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions is confirmed by X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C&#8211;F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites. The approach developed herein further pushes the boundary of POS materials to withstand both aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions.

         <title>C(sp2)&#9472;H Bond Activation with a Heterometallic Nickel&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the prevalence of Ni/Al catalysts for pyridine C&#9472;H functionalization, mechanistic details of such systems remain scarce. Herein, we present the discovery of PCy3&#8208;catalyzed bond&#8208;breaking and making processes that occur in the coordination sphere of a novel Ni&#9472;Al heterometallic complex. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a low KIE of 0.9&#8211;1.1. These data suggest that both C&#9472;H activation and H2 reductive elimination steps in this system are low energy, are readily accessible, and are not rate limiting.








Abstract
Herein we present a ligand&#8208;catalyzed bond&#8208;breaking and making process that occurs with a Ni&#8211;Al heterometallic complex. While combinations of Ni pre&#8208;catalysts and Al additives are known for site&#8208;selective C&#9472;H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD)2] and [(BDI)AlH2] (1; BDI&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni&#8211;Al heterometallic complex [(&#951;4&#8208;COD)Ni{(&#956;&#8208;H)2Al(BDI)}] (2; COD&#160;=&#160;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp2)&#9472;H activation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H2 evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy3. The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9&#8211;1.1.

     alt="C(sp2)&#9472;H Bond Activation with a Heterometallic Nickel&#8211;Aluminium Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the prevalence of Ni/Al catalysts for pyridine C&#9472;H functionalization, mechanistic details of such systems remain scarce. Herein, we present the discovery of PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed bond-breaking and making processes that occur in the coordination sphere of a novel Ni&#9472;Al heterometallic complex. The reaction is 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order in PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and proceeds with a low KIE of 0.9&#8211;1.1. These data suggest that both C&#9472;H activation and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductive elimination steps in this system are low energy, are readily accessible, and are not rate limiting.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we present a ligand-catalyzed bond-breaking and making process that occurs with a Ni&#8211;Al heterometallic complex. While combinations of Ni pre-catalysts and Al additives are known for site-selective C&#9472;H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and [(BDI)AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; BDI&#160;=&#160;2,6-diisopropylphenyl-&#946;-methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni&#8211;Al heterometallic complex [(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-COD)Ni{(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(BDI)}] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;; COD&#160;=&#160;1,5-cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H activation of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order in PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9&#8211;1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Assisted Assembly of Stable High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I)&#8208;Alkyne Nanoclusters for X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted assembly strategy has been developed for the construction of high&#8208;nuclearity copper nanoclusters. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray scintillation properties of the high&#8208;nuclearity nanocluster are investigated for the first time, demonstrating their potential for advanced radiation detection applications.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;nuclearity, atomically precise copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters remains a formidable challenge due to their high reactivity and&#160;strong aggregation tendency. Here, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted assembly strategy that enables the ambient&#8208;condition synthesis of two robust copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the different core structures including [(C2)8@Cu50] (Cu50) and [(C2)10@Cu56] (Cu56). Both clusters feature distinctive metal shells stabilized by synergistic Cu&#9472;C/O coordination interactions and an extensive outer&#8208;layer hydrogen&#8208;bonding network between the hydroxyl groups of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol &#160;and CF3COO&#8722; ligands,&#160;enhancing molecular rigidity and inoxidizability. Notably, Cu50 displays strong yellow phosphorescence and prominent X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL). More significantly, it represents the first high&#8208;nuclearity copper nanocluster to be processed into a scintillator film, which exhibits promising X&#8208;ray imaging performance. The present work not only establishes a generalizable hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted assembly strategy for constructing stable, high&#8208;nuclearity copper(I)&#8208;alkyne nanoclusters, but also demonstrates their practical applicability in X&#8208;ray scintillation, providing new insights into the synthetic design and functional diversification of nanocluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Alkali Metal Cations Impact the Selectivity of Radical&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical C&#9472;H Chlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we found that alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can impact the *Cl binding energy, which controls selectivity between radical&#8208;mediated electrochemical C&#9472;H chlorination and competing Cl2 formation.








Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a promising route toward facilitating organic transformation reactions in a sustainable manner. However, there are often a multitude of factors at play; hence, it can be unclear how operating conditions can be rationally tuned to optimize selectivity. Here, we demonstrate how the identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can control the selectivity of electrochemical C&#9472;H chlorination. Specifically, we obtained a 90.3% Faradaic efficiency with KCl as compared to 78.4% with LiCl for the conversion of cyclohexane to chlorocyclohexane at 1000&#160;mA using an IrOx electrode. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments indicate a greater propensity for Cl&#8722; oxidation to generate Cl radicals in the order: K+&#160;&gt;&#160;Na+&#160;&gt;&#160;Li+. This leads to an increase in the selectivity toward the chlorination of cyclohexane and a concomitant decrease in competitive Cl2 formation. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments indicate that this is likely due to a decrease in *Cl binding energy on IrOx in the presence of K+. These findings highlight the important role of alkali metal cations, which can be a key consideration for designing electrochemical organic synthesis systems.

         <title>Atomic Metal&#8210;Nonmetal Catalytic Pair Cooperatively Drives Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic Mn&#9472;S catalytic pair for driving efficient enzyme&#8208;like catalysis is reported. Poisoning experiments and theoretical calculations reveal a metal&#8210;nonmetal dual&#8208;site cooperative mechanism, in which the S site not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn metal center to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also directly participates in the catalytic process by stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximum atom utilization and well&#8208;defined coordination environments are promising alternatives to natural enzymes. However, their catalytic performance in enzymatic reactions is intrinsically restricted by the scaling relations, which impose an inherent trade&#8208;off between substrate adsorption/activation and product desorption. Here we report atomically dispersed manganese&#8210;sulfur (Mn&#9472;S) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively drive enzymatic catalysis, in which the S atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn site to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also functions as the secondary catalytic site for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption. Consequently, this metal&#8210;nonmetal dual&#8208;site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity. As a potential application, the Mn&#9472;S catalytic pairs with coupled catalase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities are successfully demonstrated for synergistic tumor catalytic therapy. This work establishes a paradigm for the rational design of highly efficient artificial enzymes through catalytic pair engineering.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Dissolution Relay for Deep Progression of Active Sites Toward Efficient and Ultralong&#8208;Life Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering competitive bonding in the medium&#8208;entropy NiCoCu hydroxides, we provide theoretical and experimental understandings of how the Cu/Co dual&#8208;cation dissolution relay happens for initiating deep activation of the active network. The resulting ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) &#947;&#8208;oxyhydroxide nanodomains enable in situ &#8220;self&#8208;rescue&#8221; of reactivity, demonstrating a considerable capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 after 150&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides serve as efficient aqueous cathode materials but suffer from the challenge of structure degradation during long&#8208;term cycling applications. Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100&#160;000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium&#8208;entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium&#8208;entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p&#8208;band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual&#8208;cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As&#8208;incorporated Co vacancies favor the &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;&#947; phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 was achieved after 150&#160;000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiCo&#8208;based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.

The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium-entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p-band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual-cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As-incorporated Co vacancies favor the &#946;-to-&#947; phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved after 150&#160;000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state-of-the-art NiCo-based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysts Based on N&#8208;(Hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide for Photopolymerization and 3D Printing Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, two benzothioxanthene imide dyes demonstrate excellent photochemical properties. When used as photocatalysts, they work with amine and iodonium salt or sulfonium salt to form different three&#8208;component systems for effectively initiating photopolymerization under visible light, through photoredox catalysis processes. The best formulations can be applied for 3D printing and direct laser write. This work offers a strategy for developing novel photosensitive dyes as photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photoredox catalytic systems are widely used in free radical polymerization as an important photoinitiating approach. However, many reported photoredox catalytic systems are limited by their low stabilities, high excitation powers, and low initiating efficiencies upon excitation in the visible region. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop efficient photoinitiating systems for photopolymerization under visible light. In this work, three new effective photosensitizers from N&#8208;(hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide derivatives, namely 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI), 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI&#8208;Br) and 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione 6,6&#8208;dioxide (BTXIO), were designed by density functional theory calculation and synthesized as photoredox catalysts for visible light induced photopolymerization. When combined with initiators such as oxidants, that is, bis(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate or sulfonium salts (i.e., thianthrenium salts, phenoxathiinium salt, phenothiazinium salt, dibenzothiophenium salt) and the reductant ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate to form three&#8208;component initiating systems, they showed good to high performance in visible light photo polymerizations with LED@405&#160;nm and LED@450&#160;nm. In addition, these photoinitiating systems enable the successful digital light processing and direct laser writing of 3D structures with high resolution, demonstrating a promising strategy for 3D printing applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Enrichment and Quantitative Analysis of In Vivo Protein Complexes via Dimethylpiperidine Cross&#8208;Linker DPST</title>

         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), an enrichable and quantifiable cross&#8208;linker, offers the advantages of membrane permeability and biocompatibility. It enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via tandem mass tag (TMT) antibody, minimizing sample loss and enabling in vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) analysis of 1E4 cells. The isotope labeling feature of DPST ensures precise quantification in dynamic environments. With its flexible design supporting various isotope labeling configurations (6/10&#8208;plex), DPST holds significant promise for advancing biomedical research.








Abstract
In vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) enables the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein complexes in living cells. However, most XL&#8208;MS methods face significant sample loss during enrichment, limiting their applications to limited&#8208;quantity samples, and suffer from poor reproducibility (20%&#8211;40%), hindering precise quantification. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel membrane&#8208;permeable cross&#8208;linker, 2,6&#8208;dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), in which the dimethylpiperidinyl group enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via tandem mass tags (TMTs) antibody approach, eliminating sample loss from multi&#8208;step processes and allowing analysis from as few as 1E4 cells. DPST also allows the light and heavy isotopic labeling of cross&#8208;linked samples at the cellular level, which reduces inaccuracies from multi&#8208;step preparations. This generates reporter ions for precise MS2 quantification, improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio without increasing spectral complexity. Using DPST, we analyzed cross&#8208;links in primary neurons from single fetal mice and quantified the transient and weak interactions in dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) environments. Additionally, DPST's design supports multiple isotopic labeling configurations (e.g., 6&#8208;plex, 10&#8208;plex). Therefore, DPST provides a scalable and robust tool for in vivo XL&#8208;MS&#8208;based qualitative and quantitative analysis of living cells, even with limited sample quantities.

         <title>Enzyme Induced Solid&#8208;Like Condensates Formation of Engineered Peptide in Living Cells for Prostate Cancer Inhibition</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents the condensate formation from engineered amphiphilic&#8208;branched peptides in living cells through enzymatic reactions. We describe the rational design and synthesis of DMN&#8208;SIPL, a peptide that forms solid&#8208;like condensates via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) when triggered by the type&#8208;II membrane&#8208;associated serine peptidase hepsin.








Abstract
This work describes the rational design and synthesis of hepsin&#8208;recognized amphiphilic&#8208;branched peptides (DMN&#8208;SIPL) that can form solid condensates through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon enzymatic reaction. The peptide forms solid&#8208;like condensates both in vitro and in living cells, triggered by type&#8208;II membrane&#8208;associated serine peptidase, hepsin, whose overexpression determines prostate cancer progression. Specifically, integrating self&#8208;assembly, hepsin hydrolysis, and hepsin&#8208;binding domain generates a branched substrate that acts as a precursor for enzyme&#8208;induced LLPS. Upon binding hepsin on the cell membrane, DMN&#8208;SIPL forms condensates initiated by hepsin&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The prostate cancer cells then uptake these condensates via lipid raft&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The entrapped hepsin in the condensates further hydrolyzes the DMN&#8208;SIPL to stabilize the intracellular condensates. Structure&#8211;activity relationship reveals the importance of enzyme&#8208;binding motif, enzyme&#8208;recognized motif, and the self&#8208;assembly motif. Mechanistic studies indicate that the resulting solid&#8208;like condensates modulate cancer cell metabolism by inhibiting hepsin upstream protein activation and downstream signal transduction, ultimately inducing cancer cell growth inhibition selectively. As a first example, this work investigates enzymatic LLPS condensate formation in living cells, paving the way to generate functional synthetic biomolecular condensates through LLPS for biomedical applications.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Vacancies with Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites for Stable and Efficient Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniformly dispersed Cu single atoms on the In2O3 enable efficient photothermal CO2 conversion through modulating the synergy with induced oxygen vacancies. The catalyst exhibits an optimal reactivity (1108&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO with selectivity &gt;99%) at a moderate Cu loading (2.4&#160;wt%). 








Abstract
Photothermal catalysis under mild conditions represents a promising and sustainable approach for CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals, thereby enabling efficient carbon recycling. However, precise manipulation of active sites and their coordination environments at the atomic level to enhance catalyst performance still remains a challenge. Here, we present a single&#8208;atom doping strategy for oxygen vacancy engineering to facilitate efficient CO2 conversion. Specifically, an In2O3&#8208;based catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies induced by homogeneously dispersed Cu single atoms is constructed, exhibiting a competent CO2 reduction performance in photothermal reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction. The optimal Cu&#8208;In2O3 catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 46.17&#160;mol&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;99%) and demonstrates stability over 450 h under 3&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 full&#8208;spectrum light illumination. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations elucidate that the Cu single atoms synergistically interact with oxygen vacancies to promote H2 dissociation and CO2 activation under photoexcitation. This work provides insights into the design of photothermal catalysts, emphasizing the transformative potential of atomic&#8208;site engineering for efficient CO2 conversion and sustainable energy technologies.

&lt;p&gt;The uniformly dispersed Cu single atoms on the In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enable efficient photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion through modulating the synergy with induced oxygen vacancies. The catalyst exhibits an optimal reactivity (1108&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; CO with selectivity &amp;gt;99%) at a moderate Cu loading (2.4&#160;wt%). 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal catalysis under mild conditions represents a promising and sustainable approach for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into high-value chemicals, thereby enabling efficient carbon recycling. However, precise manipulation of active sites and their coordination environments at the atomic level to enhance catalyst performance still remains a challenge. Here, we present a single-atom doping strategy for oxygen vacancy engineering to facilitate efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. Specifically, an In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies induced by homogeneously dispersed Cu single atoms is constructed, exhibiting a competent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction performance in photothermal reverse water-gas shift reaction. The optimal Cu-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 46.17&#160;mol&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with near-unity selectivity (&amp;gt;99%) and demonstrates stability over 450 h under 3&#160;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; full-spectrum light illumination. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations elucidate that the Cu single atoms synergistically interact with oxygen vacancies to promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation under photoexcitation. This work provides insights into the design of photothermal catalysts, emphasizing the transformative potential of atomic-site engineering for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and sustainable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr Sites for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;xylene from Tandem Upcycling of PET and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A with atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites was successfully developed at ambient temperature and pressure, which not only exhibits efficient activation of C&#9552;O and H&#9472;H bonds but also possesses a fast hydrogen spillover effect. These properties endow this catalyst with superior catalytic activity for the upcycling of waste PET and CO2 into p&#8208;xylene (PX) and ethylene glycol (EG).








Abstract
Exploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C&#9552;O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p&#8208;xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to form Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites. The Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro&#8208;deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36&#160;h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites also drives the reaction process.

         <title>Deciphering Coulombic Efficiency of Lithium Metal Anodes by Screening Electrolyte Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor basicity (&#946;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, which provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design. 








Abstract
Coulombic efficiency (CE) is a quantifiable indicator for the reversibility of lithium metal anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the quantitative relationship between CE and electrolyte properties has yet to be established, impeding rational electrolyte design. Herein, an interpretable model for estimating CE based on data&#8208;driven insights of electrolyte properties is proposed. Hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor basicity (&#946;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of solvents govern anode interphase chemistry. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Using the new solvent screened by above regression model, the lithium metal anode in the pouch cell with an energy density of 418 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 achieves the highest CE of 99.2%, which is much larger than previous CE ranging from 70%&#8211;98.5%. This work provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design.

         <title>Intermediate Layer&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanoparticles Enable Deep Bioorthogonal Liver Tumor and Vascular Imaging via Switchable NIR&#8208;II Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the intermediate layer of lanthanide nanoparticles, we achieve switchable NIR&#8208;II emissions, enabling high&#8208;resolution vascular imaging at 1525&#160;nm and deep bioorthogonal liver tumor imaging at 1064&#160;nm. This will provide reference for designing imaging probes to adapt to fluorescence imaging in different scenes.








Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has become an attractive optical region for fluorescence imaging. However, due to the complexity in vivo, NIR&#8208;II light with various wavelengths for different imaging scenes has not been investigated. Here, we found that 1525&#160;nm light is suitable for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging due to low background interference, while its attenuation in vivo makes it unsuitable for deep imaging. The 1064&#160;nm light is suitable for deep imaging. The impact of Yb3+ ions and the proportion of the intermediate layer in lanthanide nanoparticles on the modulation of emissions were investigated. The intense 1064&#160;nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525&#160;nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR&#8208;II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high&#8208;resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high&#8208;performance fluorescent probes.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Alcohols Enabled by Photocatalytic Radical Brook Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of radical Brook rearrangement in asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed, enabling enantioconvergent synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. The reaction proceeded through the combination of photocatalytic generation of masked ketyl radicals and Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides. The the presence of para&#8208;methoxyphenyldimethylsilyl group lowers the oxidation potentials of the racemic alcohol substrates, enabling a radical relay process to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals from initial generation of the aryl cation radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. The formal synthesis of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031 and various down&#8208;stream transformations demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.








Abstract
While radical Brook rearrangement has emerged as a powerful strategy in modern organic synthesis, enantioselective cross coupling involving radical Brook rearrangement remains unexplored. Herein, we report a photocatalytic radical Brook rearrangement followed by cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides, enabling the enantioconvergent construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. Key to this transformation is a radical relay process involving sequential generation of aryl cation radicals, alkoxy radicals, and carbon&#8208;centered radicals through Brook rearrangement. The reaction exhibits exceptional scope (&gt;40 examples), outstanding enantiocontrol (up to 99% ee), and broad functional group tolerance.

     alt="Enantioconvergent Synthesis of &#945;-Fluoroalkyl Alcohols Enabled by Photocatalytic Radical Brook Rearrangement"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first application of radical Brook rearrangement in asymmetric cross-coupling reaction has been developed, enabling enantioconvergent synthesis of chiral &#945;-aryl-&#945;-fluoroalkyl alcohols. The reaction proceeded through the combination of photocatalytic generation of masked ketyl radicals and Ni-catalyzed asymmetric cross-coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides. The the presence of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenyldimethylsilyl group lowers the oxidation potentials of the racemic alcohol substrates, enabling a radical relay process to form carbon-centered radicals from initial generation of the aryl cation radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. The formal synthesis of bioactive Odanacatib and LX-1031 and various down-stream transformations demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While radical Brook rearrangement has emerged as a powerful strategy in modern organic synthesis, enantioselective cross coupling involving radical Brook rearrangement remains unexplored. Herein, we report a photocatalytic radical Brook rearrangement followed by cross-coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides, enabling the enantioconvergent construction of chiral &#945;-fluoroalkyl alcohols. Key to this transformation is a radical relay process involving sequential generation of aryl cation radicals, alkoxy radicals, and carbon-centered radicals through Brook rearrangement. The reaction exhibits exceptional scope (&amp;gt;40 examples), outstanding enantiocontrol (up to 99% ee), and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through formal syntheses of bioactive Odanacatib and LX-1031, along with diverse downstream derivatizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Al3+&#8208;Dependent Anisotropic Facet Tailoring on SrTiO3 Single Crystal for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

By precisely controlling Al3+ concentration in SrCl2 molten salt through the addition of miscible AlCl3, the anisotropic SrTiO3 single crystals with well&#8208;defined {100}, {111}, and {110} facets can be sequentially synthesized, achieving the optimal remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 2621.85&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 and apparent quantum yield value of 50.5% at 350&#160;nm for stoichiometric photocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Controllable fabrication of single&#8208;crystal metal oxide is of paramount importance for advanced photo(electro)catalytic applications, but achieving nonequilibrium crystal shapes with tailored facets through molten salt synthesis still remains a challenge. Herein, we systematically explored the effect of Al3+ concentration in tailoring crystal facets of SrTiO3 single crystals and developed a one&#8208;step molten salt strategy for engineering anisotropic structures by using miscible AlCl3 as Al3+ additive. By progressively increasing Al3+ concentration, a series of high&#8208;quality SrTiO3 single crystals exposing {100}, {111}, and {110} facets were sequentially synthesized. Theoretical calculations reveal an Al&#8208;doping stabilized {111} surface reconstruction and provide further atomistic insights into the surface structural evolution with Wulff constructions as Al3+ concentration increases. Experimental results demonstrate that the anisotropic facets dominate the efficient charge separation for the enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting activity. Consequently, SrTiO3 single crystals enclosed by well&#8208;defined {100} and {111} facets exhibit a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 2621.85&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield value of 50.5% at 350&#160;nm for stoichiometric overall water splitting. This work offers a molten&#8208;salt synthetic strategy and valuable insight for preparing facet&#8208;controlled single&#8208;crystal semiconductors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Activated Heterogeneous Fenton Process for Accelerated Degradation of Aromatic Pollutants over Copper Oxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement of CuO for H2O2 activation and self&#8208;accelerated pollutant degradation, contrasting the performance decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. CuO can stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals to further mediate the H2O2 activation and meanwhile yielding low&#8208;valent Cu. This offers opportunities for simultaneously addressing the catalyst passivation and redox cycling limitations of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton&#8208;like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer route, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low&#8208;valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe&#8208;Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst&#8208;phenol interaction towards self&#8208;activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14&#8208;time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100&#8208;day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst&#8208;pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.

         <title>Modulating the Polarity of Imine Bonds in Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the polarity of imine (C&#9552;N) bonds in donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with fluorinated units balances exciton binding and charge separation. A moderate C&#9552;N polarity delivers optimal H&#8322; evolution (14.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; g&#8315;&#185;), offering insights into polarity&#8211;performance relationships in COF photocatalysts.








Abstract
The development of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has also drawn attention to the influence of the nature of imine binding, including its orientation and possible protonation, on the chemical and physical properties of imine COFs. However, the influence of the polarity of imine bond (C&#9552;N) on the photocatalytic performance of COFs has not yet been described. In this work, we synthesized a series of imine COFs with differently polarized C&#9552;N bonds by altering the C&#9552;N bond orientation and regulating the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) strength, respectively. The less polarized C&#9552;N bond for one of the COFs possesses a faster charge separation with a decrease of exciton binding energy (Eb). In contrast, the imine COF with more polarized C&#9552;N bond exhibits a stronger internal electric field contributing to a more efficient charge transfer. Taking into account this trade&#8208;off between binding energy and charge transfer concerning the effect of C&#9552;N polarity on the photocatalytic performances, the imine COF with moderately polarized C&#9552;N bond shows the highest hydrogen evolution performance of 14.0&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides evidence that the polarity of C&#9552;N should be taken into account when designing and tuning the properties of imine COFs.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Promoted C&#9472;C Coupling for Selective Methane Conversion into Ethane on Cerium Oxide Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

Surface hydroxyl modification on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts enhances CH4 chemisorption, reducing the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling and effectively suppressing over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, thereby achieving approximately 97% selectivity over a 200&#8208;h flow operation.








Abstract
Converting methane into high&#8208;value chemicals under mild conditions offers substantial environmental and energy benefits but is challenged by the difficulty of activating C&#9472;H bonds and preventing over&#8208;oxidation. In this study, the pivotal role of hydroxyl&#8208;rich surfaces on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is demonstrated in directing selective C&#9472;C coupling of methane. These surface hydroxyls not only enhance methane chemisorption and improve charge separation, but also promote favorable interactions with molecular oxygen, collectively boosting catalytic performance. Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups lower the energy barrier for ethane formation while suppressing its over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, resulting in significantly improved selectivity. Under ambient conditions in a flow&#8208;reactor system, the catalyst achieves a continuous ethane production rate of 187 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with approximately 97% selectivity over an extended operation period (&gt;200&#160;h), surpassing previous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems. This work provides critical insights into the role of hydroxyl&#8208;modified local environment in methane valorization, paving the way for the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic systems.

&lt;p&gt;Surface hydroxyl modification on noble-metal-free photocatalysts enhances CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; chemisorption, reducing the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling and effectively suppressing over-oxidation to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby achieving approximately 97% selectivity over a 200-h flow operation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting methane into high-value chemicals under mild conditions offers substantial environmental and energy benefits but is challenged by the difficulty of activating C&#9472;H bonds and preventing over-oxidation. In this study, the pivotal role of hydroxyl-rich surfaces on noble-metal-free photocatalysts is demonstrated in directing selective C&#9472;C coupling of methane. These surface hydroxyls not only enhance methane chemisorption and improve charge separation, but also promote favorable interactions with molecular oxygen, collectively boosting catalytic performance. Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups lower the energy barrier for ethane formation while suppressing its over-oxidation to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in significantly improved selectivity. Under ambient conditions in a flow-reactor system, the catalyst achieves a continuous ethane production rate of 187 &#181;mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with approximately 97% selectivity over an extended operation period (&amp;gt;200&#160;h), surpassing previous noble-metal-free photocatalytic systems. This work provides critical insights into the role of hydroxyl-modified local environment in methane valorization, paving the way for the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uni&#8208;Electrolyte: An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Designing Electrolyte Molecules for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, was constructed to design electrolyte molecules for rechargeable batteries. The Uni&#8208;Electrolyte includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor, which can design new molecules, predict their retrosynthesis pathways and reaction conditions, and predict the chemical mechanism to produce a solid electrolyte interphase, respectively.








Abstract
Electrolytes are an essential part of rechargeable batteries, such as lithium batteries. However, electrolyte innovation is facing grand challenges due to the complicated solution chemistry and infinite molecular space (&gt;1060 for small molecules). This work reported an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, for designing advanced electrolyte molecules, which mainly includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor. New molecules can be designed by combining high&#8208;throughput screening and generative AI models from more than 100 million alternative molecules in the EMolCurator module. The molecular properties, including frontier molecular orbital information, formation energy, binding energy with a Li ion, viscosity, and dielectric constant, can be adopted as the screening parameters. The EMolForger and EMolNetKnittor modules can predict the retrosynthesis pathway and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation mechanism for a given molecule, respectively. With the assistance of advanced AI methods, the Uni&#8208;Electrolyte is strongly supposed to discover new electrolyte molecules and chemical principles, promoting the practical application of next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

An electron&#8208;rich tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen is developed by Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202504825) to enhance thermal conductivity in polymer composites through molecular&#8208;level interface engineering. Through combined structural, photophysical, and theoretical analyses, it is shown that strong affinity between the mesogen and nanofillers such as boron nitride and graphite significantly boosts thermal conductivity, offering a new strategy for interface&#8208;engineered thermal materials.

A hybrid metal&#8211;enzyme electrode integrating bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) with a metallic catalyst facilitates enhanced CO2 electroreduction. The bCA dynamically catalyzes the reversible conversion between CO2 and bicarbonate, enabling local CO2 regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enzyme&#8208;mediated CO2 supply significantly boosts CO2RR current density beyond mass transfer limits, even under flooding conditions, as reported by Jinwoo Lee, Jungbae Kim, Ki Tae Park et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202504380).

         <title>Inside Front Cover: In&#8208;Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 30/2025)</title>

CO2 electrolysis is considered a promising strategy for producing valuable chemicals. However, it is challenging to selectively convert CO2 into long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals due to the difficulty of controlling complex C&#9472;C coupling during the reaction process. In their Research Article (e202502740), Takayoshi Ishimoto, Miho Yamauchi et&#160;al. demonstrate the effective enhancement of in&#8208;situ Raman scattering signals by employing precisely designed electrode structures, which reveal that the crucial step in C&#9472;C coupling is the asymmetric coupling of CO and CH2, thereby advancing CO2 electroreduction to the production of long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals.

         <title>Frontispiece: Utilizing the Mn(II) Dissolution&#8208;Induced Vacancy for Optimum Mg2+ Storage of Spinel Mn3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution of Mn(II) at the tetrahedral sites in spinel Mn3O4 can induce a morphological transformation (like slicing bread with a knife) and the formation of vacancies, enabling high capacity and fast reaction kinetics of magnesium ion batteries (to be delicious when the jam is spread), as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202503535).

         <title>Rational Design of Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview offers a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy and outlines two design strategies for Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents: thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block Type&#8208;II excitation energy transfer, and kinetic optimization of photoinduced electron/hydrogen transfer processes to enhance Type&#8208;I pathway.








Abstract
Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents can not only produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, but also directly damage biomolecules through electron/hydrogen transfer process, exhibiting reduced dependence on oxygen concentration in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The rational design of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents has attracted increasing attention. This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I PDT and its advantages in treating hypoxic tumors. It systematically outlines two complementary design strategies: i) thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block the Type&#8208;II energy transfer pathway, and ii) kinetic enhancement of electron/hydrogen transfer to favor the Type&#8208;I mechanism. Finally, key challenges in Type&#8208;I PDT are discussed, and future perspectives are highlighted to facilitate the clinical translation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. We hope this review will stimulate further progress in the development of innovative PDT.

Visible light&#8208;driven photochemistry has advanced significantly, offering diverse methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. Photocatalysis using red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is particularly notable due to its lower energy, reduced phototoxicity, minimized side reactions, and deeper penetration into reaction media. This minireview summarizes recent developments in red&#8208; and NIR&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, emphasizing radical generation and reactive intermediates for organic synthesis. Applications in small&#8208;molecule activation, polymer chemistry, and biologically relevant transformations are discussed, highlighting the growing potential of these photochemical processes in fundamental and applied chemistry.








Abstract
The field of visible light&#8208;mediated photochemistry has experienced significant growth, leading to the development of a wide array of methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, photocatalysis by using long&#8208;wavelength light such as red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light has garnered substantial attention. These strategies have inherent benefits of low energy, including minimal health hazards, less side reactions, and increased penetration through diverse reaction media. In this minireview, we present an overview of recent advancements in red&#8208; and NIR light&#8208;induced photocatalysis for the generation of various radicals and key intermediates in organic synthesis. Additionally, this minireview will recount the application of small&#8208;molecule activation, polymer science, and bio&#8208;related aspects to offer a comprehensive framework and insight of photochemistry mediated by red and NIR light.

Porous conductive ion&#8208;selective membranes (PCIMs) enable low&#8208;resistance, high&#8208;selectivity ion transport in sustainable energy devices. This review explores emerging PCIMs with sub&#8208;nano/nanometer pores, focusing on ion transport mechanisms, key pore characteristics, and design strategies. It also highlights advances in PCIM applications, including fuel cells, flow batteries, and Li&#8212;S batteries. By integrating theory with design principles, this review provides insights for optimizing PCIMs and advancing membrane&#8208;based energy technologies.








Abstract
Porous conductive ion&#8208;selective membranes (PCIMs), as key components of sustainable energy devices, have attracted widespread research interest owing to their unique pore structures and properties for achieving low&#8208;resistance high&#8208;ion&#8208;selectivity transport. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency PCIMs remains challenging, and the intricate relationship between the structural properties of PCIMs and its pivotal influence on the performance of energy devices is not well explored. This review focuses on emerging PCIMs with sub&#8208;nano/nanometer pores, particularly their design strategies, and fabrication processes. First, the theorical mechanisms underlying ion transfer in confined pores is comprehensively discussed. Subsequently, the effect of a series of pore characteristics&#8212;including size, charge, geometry, orientation, and durability on ion&#8208;selective transport and their regulation strategies are discussed and summarized. Then, effective and universally known methods for designing and adjusting PCIMs containing intrinsic pores, induced pores, and composite pores are highlighted. Furthermore, the progresses of PCIM applications in emerging electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, flow batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries, and concentration batteries are summarized. Overall, this review aims to provide a valuable reference for scholars and researchers dedicated to the study of PCIMs, thereby contributing to the ongoing progress in this field.

Furthermore, the progresses of PCIM applications in emerging electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, flow batteries, Li-ion batteries, and concentration batteries are summarized. Overall, this review aims to provide a valuable reference for scholars and researchers dedicated to the study of PCIMs, thereby contributing to the ongoing progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>
Ning et&#160;al., have reported a very interesting and promising electrochemical method of 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. The only part of this article that seems to be disputable is the reported mass spectrometry data, namely, the lack of specification of the employed LC&#8208;MS conditions, sometimes the wrong m/z values assigned to the species claimed to be identified, and the lack of the mass spectra of NADH.








Abstract
Recently, Ning et&#160;al., have reported a very interesting and promising electrochemical method of 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. NAD+ forms host&#8211;guest complex with the cucurbit[8]uril anchored to the NiO surface, and then NAD+ approaches the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO, which leads to the effective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. It is reasonable to expect that the method will find practical application in the industrial processes in which 1,4&#8208;NADH is employed, lowering their costs. The only part of the article by Ning et&#160;al., which seems to be disputable, is the reported mass spectrometry data, sometimes a lack of data, as described in detail in this correspondence.

         <title>Photogenerated Holes Induced Deep Sodium Storage of TiO2/CdSe/NFPP Cathode for High&#8208;Efficiency Photorechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;functional TiO2/CdSe/NFPP cathode was designed for photorechargeable sodium batteries. Photogenerated holes from CdSe migrate to NFPP, facilitating efficient sodium deintercalation. The holes&#8208;absorbed film&#8208;forming agent FEC on NFPP causes a thin NaF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase, which effectively suppresses electron tunneling and electrolyte decomposition. The PRSBs deliver high capacity and conversion efficiency (4.34%).








Abstract
Resource&#8208;friendly photorechargeable sodium batteries (PRSBs) integrate energy storage devices with solar cells, offering a promising path for sustainable energy. Herein, a novel TiO2/CdSe/Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP) cathode was prepared layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer utilizing resource&#8208;abundant commercialized NFPP and photoactive CdSe. The aligned energy levels with type II band structure ensure effective transfer of photogenerated holes from CdSe (&#8722;5.71&#160;eV) to higher valence band of NFPP (&#8722;5.10&#160;eV). Experimental results reveal that, during charging, the induced holes in NFPP accelerate the transition of Fe2+ to Fe3+ with a change of O&#8211;Fe hybrid orbitals. The calculations of bond valence sum and energy distribution reveal that NFPP&#8208;holes possesses broad Na+ transport path with reduced transport barrier (from 0.512 to 0.428&#160;eV), improving Na+ extraction efficiency. Additionally, photogenerated holes could regulate surface charge distribution on NFPP and thus form a film&#8208;forming agent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#8208;dominated electric double layer. Finally, it converts to a thinner (9.75&#160;nm illumination) NaF&#8208;rich cathode interphase layer, avoiding subsequent excessive electrolyte decomposition. As a result, the NFPP under illumination delivers high capacity of 119.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, showing 41.11% improvement compared to dark conditions.

         <title>Multivariate Distribution Structured Anisotropic Inorganic Polymer Composite Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Cycle and High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with multivariate distribution anisotropic structure was developed. Parts of the vermiculite sheets suspended among the PVDF matrix facilitate lithium salts dissociation and form fast Li+ transport channels. Other parts of vermiculite sheets tiled on electrolyte surface generate dense and high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, improving the interfacial kinetics and suppressing the dendrite growth.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries owing to their favorable rheological properties and interfacial compatibility with cathodes and Li anodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity and low modulus lead to inferior electrochemical performance and dendrite growth. Herein, we developed a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte comprising vermiculite sheets and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with multivariate distribution and an anisotropic structure. Within this assembly, some vermiculite sheets were suspended in the PVDF matrix to facilitate Li salt dissociation and Li+ transport, while others were tiled on the electrolyte surface, generating a dense, high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase via in situ electrochemical reduction, which further improved interfacial kinetics and suppressed dendrite growth. As a result, a high conductivity of 1.38&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 was achieved at room temperature, and the Li||Li cells displayed robust stability over 3000&#160;h. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||Li full cells delivered a specific capacity of 172&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;C and 86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5&#160;C. Additionally, practical cycle performance at a high loading (4.4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) was achieved in pouch cells. Overall, multivariate distribution and anisotropic structuring offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

Additionally, practical cycle performance at a high loading (4.4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was achieved in pouch cells. Overall, multivariate distribution and anisotropic structuring offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high-performance solid-state electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels Based on Hydration Shielding&#8208;Accelerated Redox Self&#8208;Catalytic Polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP)</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP) method was first developed for implementing the fast preparation of robust polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) without external energy at low monomer concentration. HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP shows attractive applications in scalable manufacture of PZHs coatings on diverse substrates, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, as well as excellent sand fixation ability.








Abstract
Traditional synthesis methods for polyzwitterionic hydrogels involve harsh conditions, such as thermal or UV irradiation, prolonged durations, and high monomer concentrations. Herein, we address these challenges at the meantime by proposing a novel chemical method, called hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP), facilitating the preparation of polyzwitterionic hydrogels. The discovery is that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chains can generate hydration shielding around hydrated zwitterionic monomers, promoting their effective aggregation and rapid crosslinking polymerization under the assistance of silver ions (Ag+)&#8208;potassium persulfate (S2O82&#8208;) redox catalyst. The HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method performs under mild condition (&#8722;5&#160;&#176;C to 37&#160;&#176;C) without extra energy, overcomes the critical monomer polymerization concentration limitation (wt%: 0.3%), and completes within an ultrashort polymerization time (&lt;60&#160;s). The prepared polyzwitterionic hydrogels possesses a denser network and superior mechanical properties compared to those prepared by traditional thermal/UV methods, exhibiting good antiswelling behavior, excellent lubrication performance, and significant antibacterial and anti&#8208;fouling properties. These significant advances endow HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP with attractive application potentials in manufacturing functional hydrogel coatings for biomedical device, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, and excellent sand fixation abilities. Moreover, HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method is suitable for scalable manufacture and decorative coating of polyzwitterionic hydrogels on diverse substrates in extreme environmental conditions.

         <title>Imine Reductase&#8211;Catalyzed Remote Stereocontrol for Enantiodivergent Synthesis of Cyclohexylidene&#8208;Based Axially Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic route for the enantiodivergent synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines was developed. This method features imine reductase catalyzed remote stereocontrol in establishing the unusual axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond, providing both enantiomers of chiral products in high yield with high enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines exhibit unique axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond and have shown great potential in medicinal chemistry. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging due to the long distance between the chirally relevant groups. Herein, we report a highly efficient and asymmetric synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines from 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones and primary amines catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs). Enantiodivergent IREDs were identified to provide convenient access to both enantiomers of chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, 99:1 or 1:99 enantiomeric ratio). A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines was also achieved. Moreover, protein X&#8208;ray crystallography and molecular modeling studies were conducted to provide structural insight into the remote stereocontrol of IREDs in generating cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axial chirality.

         <title>Hopping&#8208;Type Charge Transport in Controllably p&#8208;Doped Polaronic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report explores polaron&#8208;based charge transport in controllably p&#8208;type doped 2D polymers. Substoichiometric injection of holes in 2DP lattices leads to the lowest optical bandgaps and maximal electronic conductivities. Variable&#8208;temperature conductivity reveals the existence of hopping&#8208;type transport with two distinct Arrhenius regimes, which may be related to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane directional electronic transport.








Abstract
In this work, we find that controllable p&#8208;type doping leads to Holstein&#8208;type polarons in four electron&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs). Substoichometrically injecting holes into these 2DPs leads to small optical bandgaps (&lt;1.0&#160;eV) and electrical conductivities (17&#160;mS&#160;m&#8722;1) significantly higher than their undoped analogs. Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy both reveal that this arises from the formation of paramagnetic polarons. We achieve maximal conductivities when 2DPs comprised of electron&#8208;rich nodes and electron&#8208;rich linkers are combined, which is a consequence of more delocalized polarons as unveiled by diffuse&#8208;reflectance UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Variable&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity measurements reveal two distinct Arrhenius regimes in all 2DPs investigated, which we attribute to the different thermally activated processes inherent to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane electronic transport in stacked 2DP multilayers. This resulted in a maximum electronic conductivity of 326 mS m&#8722;1 at an elevated temperature. Collectively, this report provides fundamental insight into polaron&#8208;based charge&#8208;transport in p&#8208;type 2D organic layers, which we expect will form the foundation for the eventual deployment of these materials in electronic devices.

         <title>Selective C2 Electroproduction via Back Bonding in Asymmetric Copper&#8208;Copper Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs were engineered through the in situ isostructural substitution method on F&#8208;Cu3N substrates. Unlike the isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bonding between CuN and the *C1 intermediate, CuF establishes an additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding interaction. This synergy induces a charge&#8208;polarized 2*CHO adsorption configuration, concurrently enhancing coupling kinetics and C2 selectivity through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions.








Abstract
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered a highly attractive approach to reduce carbon emissions and yet encounters challenges in further converting *C1 intermediates to valuable two&#8208;carbon (C2) products. Although copper&#8208;based catalysts exhibit satisfactory adsorption energy for *C1 species, the symmetrical charge distribution at adjacent copper sites leads to a strong repulsive force between adsorbed *C1. Herein, asymmetric copper&#8208;copper (CuF&#8208;CuN) motifs with distinct adsorption behaviors have been constructed on the F&#8208;Cu3N substrate using the in situ isostructural substitution method. Compared to the high hybridization of CuN 3d and N 2p orbitals, implanted F not only reduces the hybridization strength but also endows the CuF with delocalized unpaired electrons. Accordingly, CuF, beyond forming an isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bond between Cu and the key *C1 intermediate (*CHO), offers additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding to the *CHO. With dipole interactions in the asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs, the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent *CHO is diminished, efficiently promoting the C&#8208;C coupling in CO2RR. Therefore, the CuF&#8208;CuN motifs achieve an exceptional C2 selectivity of 81.5% with a partial current density of &#8722;325.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a C2/C1 selectivity ratio of 10.47. This nuanced manipulation of atomic interactions illuminates a path to potentially groundbreaking alterations in material characteristics.

Accordingly, Cu&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, beyond forming an isolated 3d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &#963; bond between Cu and the key *C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate (*CHO), offers additional 3d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;-2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &#960; back bonding to the *CHO. With dipole interactions in the asymmetric Cu&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; motifs, the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent *CHO is diminished, efficiently promoting the C-C coupling in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Therefore, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; motifs achieve an exceptional C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 81.5% with a partial current density of &#8722;325.9&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity ratio of 10.47. This nuanced manipulation of atomic interactions illuminates a path to potentially groundbreaking alterations in material characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetically Enhanced Access to a Dynamic Polyester Platform via Sequence Selective Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulphur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare sequence&#8208;selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulphur, aromatic thioanhydrides, and epoxides yields dynamic poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) polymers. Mechanistic insights reveal a lithium&#8208;catalysed rate enhancement via ester coordination. The resulting polymers are thermally stable, backbone&#8208;editable, and processable into degradable adhesives.








Abstract
Elemental sulphur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, contains preformed dynamic sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds promising to impart dynamicity onto polymers obtained from this monomer. Yet robust methodologies to access linear polymers with tuneable properties and functionality are rare. Addressing these problems, we here report a rare sequence selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulphur with aromatic thioanhydrides and epoxides under simple lithium alkoxide catalysis yields semi&#8208;aromatic poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx). This enables access to terpolymers from a greatly improved range of epoxide comonomers compared to previous methodologies, including industrially relevant, flexible, rigid, functional and natural product&#8208;derived variants, allowing tuning of glass transition temperatures across a Tg range of&#160;&gt;150 &#176;C. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the insertion of S8 leads to an unusual rate acceleration via coordinative participation of the polyester links sitting adjacent to the propagating chain end. The thermal stability of the polymers allows for post polymerisation backbone modification via &#9472;S&#9472;S&#9472; bond metathesis. After crosslinking, these can be applied as thermally reprocessable and acid degradable adhesives. Our contribution paves the way for the rational buildup of diverse and functional polymer structures from elemental sulphur waste.

         <title>Electronically Asynchronous Transition State Tuned from Remote Site for Oxygen Atom Transfer by CuII&#8211;Nitrite Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of electronically asynchronous transition state in oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reaction by CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722; complexes (1&#8722;4) controlled from remote site. OAT reactivity was found to be linearly correlated with &#160;&#946;&#8208;LUMO and Cu(II)/(I) redox potentials, which were tuned from remote site substituents. Mechanistic study indicates asynchronous electron transfer mechanism where CuII/I reduction precedes nitrite reduction. 








Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is of paramount interest in biology. In biology, Cu&#8211;nitrite reductase reduces NO2&#8722;&#160;to NO, while alternatively NO2&#8722;&#160;can be reduced to NO at copper center via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to electron&#8208;rich substrate like PPh3. This work demonstrates systematic tuning of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy by remote site modification, which leads to systematic change in electrochemical property and OAT activity of CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722;&#160;involving electronically asynchronous transition state. For this purpose, we report here four CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2)(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination spheres but different substituents at remote sites. In going from 1 to 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy, which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism that was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states, which was controlled from remote site modification.

         <title>Layered&#8208;Spinel Heterogeneous Structure and Oxygen Vacancies Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial layer of layered&#8208;spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies was formed on the surface of LRMOs, which improved the structural stability and the reversibility of anion redox reaction. The treated cathode features high initial capacity of 314.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a coulombic efficiency of 88.3%. When cycling at 1&#160;C, the cathode shows a high capacity retention of 87.9% with a small voltage decay of 1.26&#160;mV per cycle.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) materials are considered to be the next&#8208;generation cathode for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion/metal batteries owing to their superior specific capacity, high operation voltage, and low cost. However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid&#8208;assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered&#8208;spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered&#8208;spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1&#160;C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26&#160;mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi&#8208;strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting, Vacancy&#8208;Rich HxIrOy Nanosheets for the Fabrication of Low&#8208;Ionomer&#8208;Dependent Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancies&#8208;rich, 1&#160;nm&#8208;thick &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy nanosheets with both high catalytic activity and high protonic conductivity have been prepared. This bifunction integration enables the fabrication of a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent catalyst/ionomer layer for efficient proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.








Abstract
The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrOx and protonic conducting ionomer and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalyst that possesses both IrOx&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack and demonstrate its ability to construct high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton&#8208;conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K0.5(Na0.2Ir0.8)O2 and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancy&#8208;rich, 1&#160;nm&#8208;thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in&#8208;plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy allows the fabrication of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer with enhanced exposure of catalytic sites and reduced electronic contact resistance, in contrast to common fully mixed catalyst/ionomer layers in PEMWE. This work represents an example of realizing the structural innovation in anode catalyst layer through the bifunctionality of anode catalyst.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Base Electrolyte Additive Mediates Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible ether&#8208;based electrolyte incorporating methylmagnesium chloride as a Lewis&#8208;basic additive is proposed to regulate interfacial chemistry. This electrolyte plays a crucial role in promoting a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation and enhancing Li deposition, achieved through the bifunctional effects of anion&#8208;additive interactions. The designed electrolyte contributes to the superior cycling stability of Li metal anodes.








Abstract
Electrolytes play a crucial role in regulating interfacial chemistry, which is essential for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating the simplest Grignard reagent, CH3MgCl, as an additive. This additive, endowed with Lewis&#8208;base characteristics, enhances the stability of the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface through bifunctional effects. During Li deposition, CH3Mg+ preferentially adsorbs onto the electrode surface, attracting more anions into the Helmholtz layer. Concurrently, CH3&#8722; creates an electron&#8208;rich environment, facilitating nucleophilic attacks on anions and promoting its reduction to form an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Additionally, Mg2+ undergoes electrodeposition prior to Li+, forming a Li&#8208;Mg alloy with subsequently deposited Li. This process lowers the nucleation barrier for Li deposition, resulting in improved deposition uniformity. Accordingly, the designed electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability for Li anodes in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cells and full&#8208;cells paired with LiFePO4 cathodes. Notably, Li||LiFePO4 batteries using a thin&#8208;film Li anode pre&#8208;deposited on Cu retain &#8764;92.84% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99.74%. These findings highlight the critical role of additives in engineering interfacial chemistry and provide a promising strategy for designing advanced electrolytes to improve the cycling performance of Li metal batteries.

The table of contents (TOC) figure provides a visual overview of the key innovations and findings of this study on high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The single&#8208;solvent electrolyte composed of 2.3&#160;M lithium salt in tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), which enables stable LMB operation at ultra&#8208;high voltages up to 5.0&#160;V. The electrolyte forms large weakly&#8208;solvating nanometric aggregates (n&#8208;AGG), which contribute to enhanced oxidative stability and facilitate efficient redox reactions. Notably, the electrolyte exhibits exceptional cycling stability for over 1500 h, effectively suppressing dendrite formation and demonstrating strong compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, such as NCM811 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO). The improved thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the electrolyte significantly enhances the high&#8208;voltage tolerance and cycling performance of LMBs, offering promising prospects for the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.








Abstract
The urgent need for high energy density (&gt; 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) has driven advancements in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, degradation of traditional electrolytes restricts high cut&#8208;off voltage&#160;&lt;&#160;4.4&#160;V, while low lithium transference numbers (tLi+) lead to polarization and early charge/discharge termination, which typically necessitate use of multiple solvents or salt&#8208;concentrated electrolytes to enable high&#8208;voltage chemistry. To address this challenge, we developed a single&#8208;solvent, single&#8208;salt electrolyte with tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), achieving a high tLi+ of 0.78 and enabling ultra&#8208;high&#8208;voltage LMB operation up to 5.0&#160;V. Large molecular sterics and electron density delocalization of TFEP enabled dominant presence of local aggregates (AGGs), which further populated to form large and ion&#8208;rich weakly&#8208;solvating nanometric aggregates (n&#8208;AGGs), changing redox properties and promoting the interfacial stabilities to a greater extent. As a result, we showed suppressed dendrite formation with stable cycling for over 1500 h, and full&#8208;cell operations paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) at 4.7&#160;V and with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) at 5.0&#160;V. The tuning of bulk electrolyte properties from the scale of microscopic electronic structures to mesoscopic solvation structures has effectively enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the electrolyte, paving the way for LMBs with high&#8208;voltage tolerance.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) was used to observe the in situ CO2 electroreduction process by designing copper electrodes with unique structures. This dynamic observation allowed for the capture of the C&#9472;C coupling process, where CH2 asymmetrically couples with CO to form CH2CO. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable energy conversion and carbon utilization. Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways leading from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C&#9472;C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO to form CH2CO, identified as the rate&#8208;determining step in the formation of C2+ products. These findings deepen the understanding of the C&#9472;C coupling processes, which are crucial for advancing catalyst development in electrochemical CO2 upgrading.

         <title>Designing Low&#8208;Cost High&#8208;Conductivity and Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolytes Toward High&#8208;Energy Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Evaluating the synergetic effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on the interaction between Na+ and anion balances stable interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes. Developed electrolytes enable high&#8208;energy pouch cell achieving a capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at the current density of 2C.








Abstract
Safety hazard induced by flammable electrolytes are troubling the advancement of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes are competent to address this issue, yet current designs struggle to balance the interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity due to the untamed interaction between Na+ and anion. Herein, we evaluate the effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on this interaction, revealing a systematic approach to achieve desired designs. It is shown that incorporating solvents with high DC and moderate Ea forms anion&#8208;rich solvation structure for stabilizing the anode interface and achieving necessary salt dissociation for high ionic conductivity. Specifically, propylene carbonate is incorporated as the eligible solvent into triethyl phosphate, affording non&#8208;flammable electrolytes with low cost and high ionic conductivity of 6.22&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Consequently, 1.25&#160;Ah hard carbon (HC)|NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) pouch cell delivers a high&#8208;power discharge of 5C rate and maintains an impressive capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, 6.61&#160;Ah HC|NFM pouch cell with 152.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 avoids smoke production and volume expansion during nail penetration. This work discloses an advanced strategy for deigning practical phosphate electrolytes, paving the way for developing high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Crystal&#8208;Structure and Active&#8208;Site of Defective ZnAl&#8208;Catalysts During CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning probe spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic crystal&#8208;structure and active&#8208;site evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on defective ZnAl&#8208;LDH photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Understanding of surface defects of a catalyst during the reaction process is critical to establish an accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship. Herein, combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy with scanning probe microscope, we have first established the correlations between CO2 photoreduction activities and crystal&#8208;structure/active&#8208;site of defective ZnAl layered double hydroxides (ZnAl&#8208;LDH). Specifically, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in ZnAl&#8208;LDH could effectively promote the selective adsorption of both CO2 and H2O molecules on surface Al and Zn active sites, respectively, leading to opposite transition states and the evident shrinking of crystalline structures. Under light irradiation, the adsorbed CO2 molecules transformed into *COOH intermediate on surface Al active sites, while the H2O molecules dissociated into OH group on Zn sites to provide proton, simultaneously leading to the expansion of crystalline structures and increase of layer spacing. Accordingly, these defect&#8208;dependent evolutions of surface active sites and crystalline structure contributed to the significant improvement of CO2 reduction to CO activity (17.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), much higher than that of pristine ZnAl&#8208;LDH (6.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides new insights for in&#8208;depth understanding of the electronic and crystalline changes of defective photocatalysts during the reaction process.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyl Amination of Olefins via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical Heck/allylic amination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with 1,3&#8208;butadienes and enynes at room temperature to yield &#947;&#8208;lactams. Unlike previous alkyl Heck reactions, this transformation generates hybrid alkyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical and a transposed &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical under ambient conditions.








Abstract
In contrast to traditional ground&#8208;state palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reactions, which are thermodynamically unfavorable and endothermic, excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis facilitates single&#8208;electron mechanisms, with light primarily driving the formation of alkyl radicals from triplet&#8208;state Pd(0). Here, we report a novel and mechanistically distinct Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction, where the key hybrid alkyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical intermediate is generated by the halogen atom transfer (XAT) from alkyl bromide to the Pd(0) at room temperature, without the need for photoinitiation. This hybrid species engages in the addition to dienes and conjugated enynes, producing a transposed open&#8208;shell allyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical, which undergoes radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) to yield the desired products. Density functional theory (DFT) studies offer insights into the reaction mechanism, confirming the involvement of hybrid alkyl/allyl Pd(I) radical species as key intermediates.

Human H ferritin (HuHf) is a nanocarrier for anticancer metal drugs. By cryo&#8208;EM, a 1.51&#160;&#197; structure of its adduct with Au(NHC)Cl was solved, showing a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster bound to Cys90 and Cys102. Short inter&#8208;metal distances indicate aurophilic interactions. This study highlights the power of cryo&#8208;EM in examining metal&#8208;drug&#8211;protein interactions using the strong signal of transition metal ions.








Abstract
Human H ferritin (HuHf) has excellent potential as a nanocarrier for the selective delivery of anticancer metal&#8208;based drugs to tumor cells. Here, we addressed the interaction of the gold monocarbene compound Au(NHC)Cl with HuHf by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS)&#160;measurements, which provide the metalation state of the protein subunits and demonstrate the involvement of protein cysteines in gold binding. The adduct between Au(NHC)Cl and HuHf was studied by cryo&#8208;EM measurements, resulting in a high&#8208;resolution 3D density map at 1.51&#160;&#197;. The cryo&#8208;EM structure shows a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster, located in a surface pocket of each subunit where it is bound to Cys90 and Cys102. The short inter&#8208;metal distances are diagnostic of the occurrence of aurophilic interactions. The present work demonstrates the usefulness of cryo&#8208;EM to investigate the interactions between metal&#8208;based drugs and their protein targets/carriers, also leveraging the strong signal of transition metal ions.

Electrochemically charging colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) enables the study of the intrinsic multi&#8208;carrier dynamics in quantum dots (QDs) by in situ ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, revealing the spin blockade effect and phonon bottleneck effect for hot electron cooling and allowing mechanism studies of charged QDs in various applications.








Abstract
The application of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) in optoelectronic devices and photocatalysis inevitably involves them in charged states. The carrier and exciton dynamics of electrochemically charged NCs in solutions have yet to be reported. Herein, the electrochemical charging effects in colloidal CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) are systematically investigated using static spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) and in situ transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Static SEC reveals the presence of in&#8208;gap trap states from 0.9&#160;eV below the conduction band (CB) edge. Negligible changes in TA spectra and kinetics were observed from open circuit potential (OCP) to more anodic potentials within the QD band gap. At cathodic potentials, the negatively charged QDs show band edge trion decay with a lifetime of 690&#160;&#177;&#160;31&#160;ps and slower 1P to 1S electron relaxation with time constants of 12.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8&#160;ps assigned to the spin blockade effect and 316&#160;&#177;&#160;35&#160;ps assigned to the phonon bottleneck effect. Our study reveals rich effects of charging on QD excited state under nearly native conditions.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Copolymerization of CO, Se, and Oxetane: O/Se Exchange Reaction Determining Chain Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

This manuscript demonstrates the copolymerization of Se/CO/OX to yield the well&#8208;defined poly(selenocarbonate) that can be easily converted into the poly(selenoether) via the O/Se exchange reaction.








Abstract
The incorporation of selenium (Se) atoms into polymers has garnered significant interest. However, methods to introduce selenium atoms into polymers remain limited, particularly for approaches that directly utilize elemental selenium. This work presents a novel copolymerization of gaseous carbon monoxide (CO), solid Se powder, and liquid oxetane (OX) to synthesize Se&#8208;containing polymers with tunable structure, using commercially available alkyl borane and organic bases as the binary metal&#8208;free catalyst system. The polymerization process includes two steps: the reduction of CO and Se to form COSe and alternating copolymerization of COSe with OX. The O/Se exchange reaction (O/Se ER) was discovered during the polymerization, which can alter the polymer structure. The O/Se ER could be significantly suppressed by the binary organocatalyst system at 60 &#176;C, affording well&#8208;defined poly(selenocarbonate) in a fast and selective manner. The poly(selenocarbonate) is semi&#8208;crystalline exhibiting a melting temperature of 116 &#176;C, a number&#8208;average molecular weight of 39&#160;kDa, a tensile strength of 5.0&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;MPa, and an elongation of 5.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%. Interestingly, the poly(selenocarbonate) could be completely converted into the poly(selenoether) by utilizing the O/Se ER, i.e., decarboxylation in the presence of organic bases at high temperatures. This work provides an efficient synthetic method for synthesizing Se&#8208;containing polymers from readily available monomers.

         <title>Boosting Current Density of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction using Metal&#8211;Enzyme Hybrid Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;enzyme (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid platform integrates highly stabilized and densely loaded bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) immobilized on CNTs with Sn and Bi catalysts. The enzyme dynamically catalyzes the reversible interconversion between CO2 and bicarbonate, enabling rapid local CO2 regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enhanced CO2 supply boosts CO2RR current densities beyond mass transfer limits.








Abstract
As a promising solution to global warming, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to liquid fuel has attracted great attention. A primary challenge in industrializing CO2RR technologies for producing liquid fuel is the mass transfer limitation of CO2, which significantly reduces the current density of CO2RR. This study proposes a new enzyme&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis platform for boosting CO2RR current density. This platform integrates an enzyme of bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA), stabilized on carbon nanotubes (bCA@CNT), into formate/formic acid selective metal catalysts such as tin (Sn) and bismuth (Bi) to prepare Metal&#8208;bCA (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid cathodes. The incorporation of bCA enhances both the CO2 hydration and the reversible dehydration of bicarbonate to CO2 in the cathode. This dynamic catalysis of bCA facilitates rapid local regeneration of dissolved CO2 from bicarbonate at the catalyst surface, thereby boosting the current density of CO2RR. Consequently, the formate current density of the Sn&#8208;bCA cathode was 3.3 times higher than that of the bare Sn cathode in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;type cell. Furthermore, the Bi&#8208;bCA cathode achieved an excellent&#160;current density of&#160;442&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1.5 times higher than the bare Bi cathode, for direct production of highly concentrated (3.4&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1) formic acid&#160;in a 3&#8208;compartment cell.

         <title>Au6Cu2 Clusters with High Electron Affinity and Oxygen&#8208;Mimetic Properties for Hypoxic Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

[Au6Cu2(C2C6H4X)6(PPh2C6H4PPh2)3]2+ (X&#160;=&#160;NO2, denoted as NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2; X&#160;=&#160;H, denoted as H&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters were synthesized for radiosensitizing studies. The NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles demonstrated significantly enhanced radiosensitization compared to the H&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles, attributed to their higher electron affinity, which increases hypoxic cytotoxicity and mimics the oxygen effect by reacting with DNA free radicals. 








Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron&#8208;affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose&#8208;dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene&#8208;functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia&#8208;selective toxicity arises from reductase&#8208;mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen&#8208;mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster&#8208;based hypoxic radiosensitizers.

         <title>Proton Driving Mechanism Revealed in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Atom FeN2O2 Carbon Dots for Superior Peroxidase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that sulfur doping in FeN2O2 single&#8208;atom carbon dots induces a proton driving mechanism, significantly enhancing peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This mechanism facilitates H2O dissociation and proton transfer, providing an ample supply of H* for the conversion of H2O2 to&#183;OH, as verified through KIE, in situ experiments, and DFT calculations. 








Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAEs) hold great promise as enzyme mimics, yet their catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single&#8208;atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S&#8208;FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. Synthesized via low&#8208;temperature carbonization, S&#8208;FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC&#8208;STEM. The POD&#8208;specific activity of S&#8208;FeCDs reached 295&#160;U mg&#8722;1, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than that of sulfur&#8208;free FeCDs, with natural enzyme&#8208;like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the &#916;G for H2O2&#8208;to&#8208;&#183;OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (2*OH&#160;&#8594;&#160;*O&#160;+&#160;*H2O) from 2.50 to 1.62&#160;eV. In vivo, S&#8208;FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA&#8208;infected wound models, achieving near&#8208;complete healing within 7 days. The proton driving mechanism was further validated through nitro compound reduction, demonstrating accelerated N&#9472;H bond activation. This work highlights the critical role of sulfur&#8208;induced proton dynamics in enhancing SAEs performance, providing a rational strategy for designing multifunctional nanozymes in biomedical and catalytic applications.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Antimicrobial Based on Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte and Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of supramolecular antimicrobials was developed by forming host&#8208;guest inclusion complexes between conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) and cyclodextrins. This supramolecular strategy enhanced COEs' biocompatibility without sacrificing antimicrobial efficacy, offering a new antibiotic design platform to address the typical trade&#8208;off between efficacy and selectivity in amphiphilic antimicrobials and combat antimicrobial resistance.








Abstract
The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we prepared a resveratrol&#8208;derived antimicrobial conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) named DY6 to enhance drug&#8208;like properties. While DY6&#8217;s increased hydrophobicity augmented its antibacterial efficacy, it also induced significant cytotoxicity, highlighting the long&#8208;existing dilemma of amphiphilic antimicrobials. To mitigate this issue, we employed a supramolecular strategy by complexing DY6 with sodium sulfobutyl ether &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (S&#946;CD), forming the host&#8211;guest inclusion complex DY6@S&#946;CD. This complex elevated the half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against L929 cells from 9.4 to over 128&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 while maintaining a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). NMR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic analyses confirmed that DY6&#8217;s aromatic backbone is encapsulated within the hydrophobic cavity of S&#946;CD. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that size compatibility and electrostatic interactions are essential for stable complex formation and enhanced biocompatibility. Importantly, DY6@S&#946;CD exhibited no resistance development over 14&#8208;day serial passages against S. aureus, significantly outperforming norfloxacin. In biofilm&#8208;based MRSA&#8208;infected wound and corneal models, DY6@S&#946;CD more effectively reduced bacterial load and inflammation compared to the last&#8208;resort antibiotic vancomycin. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of supramolecular host&#8211;guest approach based on COEs to overcome the drug&#8208;resistant challenges.

         <title>Liquid Coordination Polymers with Anhydrous Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional liquid coordination polymers near ambient conditions are prepared by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier. This process disrupts extended coordination networks, producing a stable liquid. Liquid properties are controlled by tuning the ratio of network modifiers, resulting in anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa&#183;s at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Liquid states in coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically considered transient intermediates in the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;glass transformations of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. However, their potential as functional materials has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by the unique properties of ionic liquids, organic liquids, and liquid metals, we explore liquid CPs as a platform for novel functionalities distinct from those of their crystalline and glass counterparts. Here, we present a strategy to achieve functional liquid CPs near ambient conditions by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier, shifting compositions away from stoichiometric ratios. This process disrupts extended coordination networks during melting, producing a stable liquid state. By tuning the ratio of network modifiers, we achieve control over liquid properties, including anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa&#183;s at 303&#160;K. These findings demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid CPs, introducing them as a new platform for designing liquid conductors.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Interface Engineering and Additive&#8208;Induced Crystallinity Tuning for High&#8208;Performance Thermally Conductive Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen (TRM) is used to develop a TRM polymer matrix (TPM) with excellent thermal conductivity and interfacial affinity with boron nitride (BN) and expanded graphite (EG). Fabricated TPM composites, which are thermally and chemically stable, can be selectively used for electrical insulation, conduction, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding.








Abstract
To boost up the properties of thermally conductive polymer composites, it is essential to conduct comprehensive research focused on interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN) or expanded graphite (EG) are commonly utilized as nanofillers to improve the thermal conductivity of polymer composites. However, the interfacial interactions between the polymer matrix and nanofillers are generally weak, making effective thermal conductivity challenging. To address this issue, we have designed and synthesized an electron&#8208;rich and aromatic tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen (TRM), which not only possesses high thermal conductivity but also exhibits excellent interfacial affinity with BN and EG at the molecular level. Systematic experiments, including photophysical, thermodynamic, structural, and computational analyses, reveal that the thermal conductivity of TRM&#8208;based polymer composites is substantially enhanced due to effective interfacial interactions between TRM and fillers. The TRM composites experimentally show excellent thermal conductivity based on enhanced interfacial phonon transfer, and these results are supported by theoretical interpretations. These findings underscore the critical importance of interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers at the molecular level in maximizing the material properties of polymer composites.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Branched PdCoPx Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>

A direct synthesis strategy was used to prepare branched Pd1Co2Px nanostructures with rich Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interface sites, demonstrating their efficacy as cathode catalysts for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). The Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces can direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products, which enhances the stability of LOB cycling. 








Abstract
Developing advanced cathode materials plays a positive role in lowering the charge/discharge overpotentials and improving the cycling performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high&#8208;dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46&#160;A mgPd&#8722;1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12&#160;A mgPd&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.17&#160;A mgPt&#8722;1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40&#160;V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces could direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.

         <title>Concurrent Production of Glycolic Acid via Anode Valorization of Plastic Paired With Cathode Upcycling of Biomass Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired electrolysis system for simultaneous glycolic acid production was constructed through combining anodic oxidation of polyethylene terephthalate hydrolysate and cathodic reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which was enabled by the rational design of a CO&#8208;tolerant PdBi alloy anode and an earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into valuable chemicals, such as glycolic acid (GA), provides a sustainable route for reclaiming the carbon resource in plastic wastes. However, valorization of EG to GA is realized solely via anodic oxidation, which is typically accompanied by the generation of low&#8208;value hydrogen at the cathode. Here, we develop a GA production system that combines anodic and cathodic GA production via oxidation of PET&#8208;derived EG paired with reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which is made possible by the discovery of a robust PdBi alloy anode and earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode. Building on the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of anti&#8208;CO poisoning on the PdBi anode and temperature&#8208;dependent GA electrosynthesis on the TiO2 cathode, our integrated electrochemical system achieves a total Faradaic efficiency of 182% for GA production. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrochemical coupling strategy paves the way for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of surplus plastic&#8208;/biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks via renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalysis.

         <title>Delicate Control Over Electron Distribution and Water Dissociation Kinetics in Strongly Coupled Ru@NMoC Hybrid Catalyst Realizes Efficient Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In alkaline seawater, ruthenium clusters in nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (Ru@NMoC) act as highly efficient catalysts to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that nitrogen doping induces electron redistribution around the Ru clusters, optimizing their electronic structure. This enhances the adsorption and desorption of intermediates, accelerating the HER kinetics.








Abstract
Delicate control over electron distribution in hybrid catalysts is crucial for improving hydrogen evolution catalysis, which remains an aspirational target in advancing efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 in 1&#160;M KOH, 1&#160;M KOH&#160;+&#160;0.5&#160;M NaCl, and 1&#160;M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N&#8208;doping of Ru clusters self&#8208;optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self&#8208;powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn&#8211;H&#8322;O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demonstrating its practicability.

         <title>Molecularly Woven Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly woven artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was constructed by coating woven polymer crystals onto the Li metal anode. The mechanical stability of these woven polymer crystals, combined with their intrinsic Li&#8208;ion channels, enables the resulting lithium&#8208;metal batteries to be dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems, but they suffer from destructive dendrite growth. Here, we integrate cutting&#8208;edge molecular weaving technology into the fabrication of artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEI) to realize dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lasting LMBs. Specifically, weaving polymer chains into a 2D plane endows polymer network crystals with high strength and elasticity and creates angstrom&#8208;level meshes for Li&#8208;ion transport and uniform deposition. As a result, related Li plating experiments remained stable at an unprecedentedly high current density of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, full cells with &#8220;woven&#8221; ASEI exhibited superior long&#8208;term cycling performance compared to existing 2D materials, achieving a capacity retention of 98% over 270 cycles under stringent testing conditions.

         <title>Deconstructive Functionalization of Cyclic Ketones via Electrochemical Interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith (IDB) reaction enables the highly regioselective deconstructive functionalization of cyclic ketones using electricity as the sole oxidant. This strategy transforms complex cyclic ketones into acyclic molecules and has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of planococcol, citrilol acetate, maconelliol, and its derivatives. Mechanistic studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover.








Abstract
Deconstructive functionalization of cyclic molecules has recently emerged as a prominent strategy to access unique architectures that are challenging to prepare through traditional methods.

&lt;p&gt;Deconstructive functionalization of cyclic molecules has recently emerged as a prominent strategy to access unique architectures that are challenging to prepare through traditional methods.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge&#8208;Linked Ionic Covalent Organic Framework with Fast Reaction Kinetics for High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A new ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) was synthesized by combining &#960;&#8208;bridge and charge&#8208;introduction strategy via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction. The &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;linked ionic liquid endow iQCOF enhanced charge transfer ability, fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and higher reaction rate. Thereby, it can be regarded as advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with rapid kinetics to achieve&#160;high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their well&#8208;defined topologies and tunable pore architectures. However, their practical application is often limited by intrinsically sluggish charge transfer and inferior reaction kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) cathode via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction with triazole ionic liquid. The iQCOF architecture achieves a synergistic enhancement by integrating &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;induced charge delocalization to facilitate charge transport, the specific adsorption effect to gain fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and polar triazine units to enable uniform ion flux for stable interfaces. As a result, iQCOF delivers a high specific capacity of 407 mAh g&#8722;1 with 701&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, and exceptional rate capability (121 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1) with 0.0027% per cycle over 10&#160;000 cycles, further highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;performance organic cathode. This work provides a convenient strategy for advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with fast reaction kinetics to achieve high&#8208;rate performance, paving the way for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species via Orbital Rehybridization Between Intermediate and Active Site for Selective Methane Photooxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique regulation mechanism of reactive oxygen was proposed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional uncontrolled generation of reactive oxygen species by regulating the interaction between active centers and key intermediate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as&#8208;formed ROS by introducing Au single atoms (SAs) on CuOx/ZnO (Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d&#8208;band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO&#8208;*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2&#8208;pz and dxz/dyz&#8208;px. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#9472;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8211;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4 molecules. As a result, Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856&#160;&#181;mol&#183;gcat.&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.

         <title>Stabilizing the Quinoidal Form of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by O&#9472;B&#8592;N Units to Give a &gt; 1000 nm Redshift in the Absorption Wavelength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating four O&#9472;B&#8592;N units into naphthalene diimide, the core is transformed from an aromatic form to a quinoidal form, significantly enhancing &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. This results in a reduced bandgap from 3.10 to 0.88&#160;eV and a redshift in absorption from 400 to 1410&#160;nm. The synthesized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exhibits strong SWIR absorption and high transparency in the visible region, developing a colorless anti&#8208;counterfeiting application.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have distinct chemical structures and excellent optoelectronic properties. Although PAHs with ultra&#8208;large &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons have been successfully synthesized, ultrasmall bandgap (Eg&#160;&lt;&#160;1.2&#160;eV) or short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light absorption (&#955;&#160;&gt;&#160;1000&#160;nm) is seldom reported for PAHs. In this work, we design and synthesize a PAH by incorporating four O&#9472;B&#8592;N units into naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the core. The incorporation of four O&#9472;B&#8592;N units changes the NDI core from an aromatic form to a quinoidal form, leading to significantly enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. As a result, the optical bandgap of the molecule decreases from 3.10 to 0.88&#160;eV, and the onset absorption wavelength is redshifted from 400 to 1410&#160;nm. The resulting molecule exhibits strong light absorption in the infrared region and high transparency in the visible region. It can be used to develop colorless infrared anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to tune optoelectronic properties of PAHs.

         <title>Quaternary Phosphonium Salts Enable Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative C&#9472;H Activation of Aminophosphines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed system for P(III)&#8208;directed C&#9472;H activation of aminophosphines and cyclization with alkynes facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, using phosphonium salts as key additives. These salts lower energy barriers, regenerate the catalyst, and protect the P(III) group, enabling stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles. 








Abstract
Quaternary phosphonium salts, despite their extensive historical study, have remained unexplored as key additives in transition metal catalysis until our current investigation. Here, we present a groundbreaking palladium&#8208;catalyzed system for P(III)&#8208;directed C&#9472;H activation of aminophosphines, followed by annulation with alkynes. By utilizing P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphines, we have achieved the stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles. This innovative process, facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, efficiently yields a wide range of P&#8208;heterocycles. The pivotal breakthrough of our methodology lies in the identification of phosphonium salts as effective additives, which undertake multiple functions: they not only reduce the energy barrier of pivotal steps but also regenerate the palladium catalyst while safeguarding the P(III) directing group from oxidation. Through systematic experimental investigations, particularly by comparing transition states with and without quaternary phosphonium salts, we have elucidated the unique reaction pathway, thereby explaining the critical role of the salts.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a palladium-catalyzed system for P(III)-directed C&#9472;H activation of aminophosphines and cyclization with alkynes facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, using phosphonium salts as key additives. These salts lower energy barriers, regenerate the catalyst, and protect the P(III) group, enabling stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles.

         <title>Air&#8208;Level Oxygen Enables 100% Selectivity in Urea Synthesis via Photocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling of CO and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon monoxide and ammonia pays a new pathway for urea synthesis under mild conditions. Herein, we proposed a universal O2&#8208;mediated urea generation pathway via the O2&#8226;&#8211; radicals act as the dominant active species to drive the mild NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 radicals, which then coupled with CO as the crucial step for urea production.








Abstract
The clean&#8208;energy&#8208;driven synthesis of urea from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules has garnered significant interest but remained great challenges to achieve with high selectivity. Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 under an air&#8208;level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31&#160;mg gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen&#8208;free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to &#8226;NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen&#8208;derived O2&#8226;&#8211;. This &#8226;NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air&#8208;level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 while preventing over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Isoreticular Synthesis of Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra with Permanent Porosity to Gas and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the synthesis of two robust, mesoporous metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (MOCs/MOPs) using an isoreticular expansion approach. Among them, the largest mesoporous MOP captures up to 0.47&#160;gwater&#183;gMOP&#8722;1, displaying an S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Synthesis of mesoporous metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (MOCs or MOPs) that retain their porous functionality in the solid&#8208;state remains challenging, given their tendency to collapse upon desolvation. Herein, we report the use of the isoreticular expansion approach to synthesize two permanently porous Rh(II)&#8208;based octahedral MOPs within the mesoporous regime. Our mesoporous MOPs, featuring internal cavities of up to 12.5&#160;nm3, withstand the activation process, enabling their use as solid&#8208;state adsorbents for gases and water. In particular, the largest mesoporous MOP, named BCN&#8208;17, captures up to 0.47&#160;gwater&#183;gMOP&#8722;1 and exhibits an S&#8208;shaped water&#8208;sorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop, characteristic of mesoporous materials.

A versatile radical SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones is reported by photodecarboxylation of free carboxylic acids via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). This mild and scalable Csp3&#9472;Csp3 bond forming alkylation method enables efficient access to Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated &#945;&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones with excellent functional group tolerance, employing carboxylic acid&#8208;based drugs, fatty acids, and steroids.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with organometallic reagents remained unsuccessful. Herein, we report an acridine&#8208;catalyzed radical SN2&#8217; alkylation of both &#946;&#8208;alkyl and &#946;&#8208;aryl substituted gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with free carboxylic acids. In this process, Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones are obtained with commendable functionality tolerance. A PCET photodecarboxylation enables for the first time SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with &#946;&#8208;H&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, addressing several challenges. This mild and scalable Csp3&#9472;Csp3 bond&#8208;forging alkylation applies to the functionalization of natural product&#8208;derived gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with carboxylic acid drugs, fatty acids, and steroids. The &#945;&#8208;chlorocyclobutenone product is further exploited in divergent organic synthesis via postsynthetic modification.

         <title>Breaking Symmetry of Active Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Valorization of Polyester Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to break symmetric sites on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The obtained defective MIL&#8208;101 (D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101) as a nanozyme featured with asymmetric Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ sites exhibits high performance for photocatalytic depolymerization of polyester plastics.








Abstract
Chemical upcycling of waste plastics offers a promising way toward achieving a circular economy and alleviating environmental pollution but remains a huge challenge. Inspired by hydrolase enzymes and aiming to overcome their intrinsic limitations, we put forward a design principle for an innovative nanozyme featuring asymmetric metal sites. This nanozyme functions as photocatalyst, enabling sustainable valorization of polyester plastics. As a proof of concept, an asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to construct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that are defective MIL&#8208;101(Fe) (D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101) with asymmetric Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ (0&lt;&#160;&#948;&#160;&lt;1) sites. The differential electronic configurations inherent to adjacent Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ sites endow a high photocatalytic activity for the valorization of polyester plastic.

&lt;p&gt;A feasible asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to break symmetric sites on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The obtained defective MIL-101 (D-MIL-101) as a nanozyme featured with asymmetric Fe&lt;sup&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites exhibits high performance for photocatalytic depolymerization of polyester plastics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical upcycling of waste plastics offers a promising way toward achieving a circular economy and alleviating environmental pollution but remains a huge challenge. Inspired by hydrolase enzymes and aiming to overcome their intrinsic limitations, we put forward a design principle for an innovative nanozyme featuring asymmetric metal sites. This nanozyme functions as photocatalyst, enabling sustainable valorization of polyester plastics. As a proof of concept, an asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to construct metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that are defective MIL-101(Fe) (D-MIL-101) with asymmetric Fe&lt;sup&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (0&amp;lt;&#160;&#948;&#160;&amp;lt;1) sites. The differential electronic configurations inherent to adjacent Fe&lt;sup&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites endow a high photocatalytic activity for the valorization of polyester plastic. Accordingly, the ester bonds of polyesters can be preferentially cleaved, contributing to the low energy barrier of upcycling plastics. As a result, the D-MIL-101 achieves a high monomer yield with terephthalic acid (TPA) of &#8764;93.9% and ethylene glycol (EG) of &#8764;87.1% for photocatalytic valorization of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), beyond the efficiency of natural enzymes and state-of-the-art photocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrodimerization of Acetylene to 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Over Neighboring Cu Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical acetylene hydrodimerization mechanisms are deciphered by correlating the nuclearity of Cu site in Cu&#8208;MOFs with catalytic performance. The neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF orchestrate three critical steps: acetylene adsorption, C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates, and 1,3&#8208;butadiene desorption, which contribute to the superior electrocatalytic selectivity of 1,3&#8208;butadiene.








Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3&#8208;butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure&#8211;performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as&#8208;designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3&#8208;butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF affords a 1,3&#8208;butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3&#8208;butadiene production rate of 64&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is about 2&#8208;fold and 20&#8208;fold higher than Cu2&#8208;MOF and Cu1&#8208;MOF. This work not only provides profound insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of acetylene hydrodimerization but also guides the rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>Lignin Dissolution and Direct Ultrasmall&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Nanoparticle Formation in Acidic and Alkaline Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Molecular&#8208;Level Insight</title>

Structural interpretation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how molecular moieties and interaction networks influence the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structures and conformational states of lignin during dissolution and aggregation: laterally shifted in deep eutectic solvents, offset&#8208;stacked in tetrahydrofuran, and stretched in dimethyl sulfoxide.








Abstract
Although deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated significant potential in lignin processing, their influence on molecular stacking and conformational evolution during lignin dissolution and nanoparticle formation remains insufficiently understood. Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single&#8208;step approach to produce self&#8208;assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one&#8208;ninth of that produced by conventional solvent&#8208;exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self&#8208;assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass lignin models (4,182&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, stacked conformations, solvent&#8208;specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral&#8208;shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H2O solvent system favors offset&#8208;stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen Bonding Tuned Enantioselectivity Control in Cobaloxime&#8208;Chiral Amine Cooperative Catalysis</title>

The dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the enamine radical cation and cobaloxime controls the enantioselectivity. 








Abstract
Cobaloxime is a versatile 3d&#8208;metal catalyst for dehydrogenative radical coupling reactions. Prior mechanistic studies of cobaloxime catalysis have revealed that cobaloxime(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process can control the site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity of radical transformation. However, the relevance of HAT to the enantioselectivity is seldom reported. Herein, our density functional theory studies of the cobaloxime&#8208;chiral amine co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling of the enamine radical cation with alkene proved that it is the HAT step that determines the enantioselectivity, instead of the previously proposed radical addition. Because the metal&#8211;alkene&#8208;coupled (MAC) radical addition is a reversible process while the followed by HAT is the rate&#8208;determining step. Moreover, computational studies suggest that the dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the radical cation and cobaloxime plays a significant role in harnessing the reactivity and tuning the enantiocontrol. The intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen bonding between the iminium and the cobaloxime fragments contributes to the lower energy barrier of MAC radical addition. Structural analysis and quantitative steric&#8208;electronic effect dissection jointly unveiled that the stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the aminium and the cobaloxime fragments is the dominant factor that stabilizes the (R)&#8208;HAT transition state and guarantees high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Assisted Interfacial Dipole for CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Over 22% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination&#8208;assisted interfacial dipole engineering is conducted for inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs, which could not only form more robust interfacial contact but also beneficial dipole alignment, leading to effective passivation and prominent energy level adjustment with additional charge transport channels, thus substantially suppressing interfacial energy losses. Consequently, the PSCs show an efficiency of up to 22.05% with superior device stability.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite attracts widespread attention in photovoltaic applications due to its superior thermal stability and optoelectronic properties. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and undesirable charge carrier transfer, predominantly limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI3 PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluorination&#8208;assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate the passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transfer at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high&#8208;performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.

Consequently, the PSCs show an efficiency of up to 22.05% with superior device stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite attracts widespread attention in photovoltaic applications due to its superior thermal stability and optoelectronic properties. However, CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and undesirable charge carrier transfer, predominantly limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3-difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluorination-assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate the passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transfer at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high-performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenylene Cage Synthesized by Metal&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Phenylene Macrocycle and Its Piezofluorochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;mediated assembly has been used to synthesize a phenylene cage with a diameter of 2.0&#160;nm. The strained nanocage exhibits intense blue emission and piezofluorochromism, with the fluorescence shifted from blue to yellow&#8211;green under pressure.








Abstract
A phenylene macrocycle containing two meta&#8208;phenylene units positioned opposite each other was used as a building block to construct phenylene cages via platinum&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C coupling. A phenylene cage (PC[10]3), consisting of three phenylene macrocycle units, was successfully synthesized and thoroughly characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. PC[10]3 exhibited significant backbone strain and displayed bright blue emission with a quantum yield of 96%. Additionally, PC[10]3 exhibited a broader and more pronounced piezofluorochromic response compared to its macrocyclic unit, undergoing a distinct photoluminescence shift from blue to yellow&#8211;green under pressure. This work opens new avenues for designing and synthesizing hydrocarbon nanocages.

         <title>Plasmonic DNA&#8208;Barcoded Virion Nano&#8208;Oscillators for Multiplexed Quantification of Small&#8208;Molecule Binding Kinetics to Membrane Proteins</title>

         <dc:description>
Multiplexed quantification of small&#8208;molecule binding kinetics to virion&#8208;displayed membrane proteins via charge&#8208;sensitive, wide&#8208;field plasmonic imaging of barcoded nanocomposite oscillators. Virion display maintains native membrane protein environments. Affinity&#8208;resolved multistate DNA barcoding efficiently addresses individual nano&#8208;oscillators and enables measurement of a library of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors on a single chip.








Abstract
A high&#8208;density nano&#8208;oscillator platform using self&#8208;assembled DNA&#8208;barcoded virion sensors is developed to address the critical need for high&#8208;throughput label&#8208;free measurement of small&#8208;molecule binding to membrane proteins. By integrating virion display technology with charge&#8208;sensitive plasmonic detection, our platform enables robust, label&#8208;free quantification of small&#8208;molecule binding kinetics to membrane proteins. Gold nanoparticle&#8208;virion conjugates are self&#8208;assembled onto a plasmonic sensor chip via a flexible molecular linker to form high&#8208;density nano&#8208;oscillators. Driven by an alternating electric field, the oscillation amplitudes of the nano&#8208;oscillators are precisely measured via widefield plasmonic imaging. This charge&#8208;sensitive mechanism can sensitively detect the binding of small&#8208;molecule ligands to the membrane proteins displayed on the virions at single&#8208;nanosensor resolution, overcoming the sensitivity limit of conventional mass&#8208;sensitive techniques. More importantly, the platform employs novel affinity&#8208;discriminated DNA barcodes for multistate decoding with exponential multiplexing capacity, enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of a library of membrane proteins. For a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, binding kinetics of five pairs of G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and their corresponding small molecule ligands are measured on a single sensor chip, with all individual nano&#8208;oscillators identified by just two affinity&#8208;discriminated, quadra&#8208;state DNA decoders. This technology advances membrane protein research and drug screening capabilities, offering a practical solution for biomolecular interaction studies and biosensing applications.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Organocatalysis with Bidentate Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a model Mukaiyama aldol reaction with unbiased substrates, high enantioselectivity was achieved with a modifiable bidentate iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bonding organocatalyst. The crucial role of halogen bonding was confirmed by the low performance of the corresponding hydrogen bond donor and via DFT calculations. 








Abstract
As the employment of &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions like halogen bonding (XB) in asymmetric catalysis is still at a very early stage, there are significant challenges to overcome. In some reported cases, the relevance of halogen bonding to the catalytic action is unclear, while in others, catalyst activity is limited. Herein, we present the second generation of a bidentate iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bond donor as a modifiable and highly active chiral halogen bonding catalyst. With these modified derivatives, high stereocontrol of up to 98% ee could be achieved in a model Mukaiyama aldol reaction for a range of different substrates. Importantly, the crucial role of halogen bonding in this catalytic process was demonstrated by the low performance of the non&#8208;iodinated variants and by DFT calculations. The latter also indicate that the stereoinduction is based on the imposed orientation of the substrates towards each other.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Psiguadial A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach harnessing reactive species enabled the enantioselective synthesis of the complex meroterpenoid psiguadial A through an enolate&#8211;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (oQM) umpolung strategy and late&#8208;stage cationic ring closure. The final fully decorated aromatic core was successfully synthesized by adaptation of modern aryl methyl ether deprotection and formylation methodologies, establishing efficient access to this class of natural products.








Abstract
The first enantioselective total synthesis of the antiproliferative natural product (&#8211;)&#8208;psiguadial A is reported. This approach features the enantioselective synthesis of a complex tricyclic terpenoid precursor, the union of that precursor with a polyketide component by an enolate&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide coupling reaction to form a highly congested carbon&#9472;carbon bond, and an acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular hydration ring&#8208;closure leveraging a fully substituted alkene to generate the unique oxepane core structure of the natural product.

We show a reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP)&#8208;thianthrenium reagents and alkyl bromides, which is catalyzed by a copper/photoredox catalyst system. The reaction provides a variety of BCP&#8208;alkylated products through the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond.








Abstract
Herein, we report a reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP)&#8208;thianthrenium reagents and alkyl bromides. The reaction is catalyzed by a copper/photoredox catalyst system. The approach is the first example of a cross&#8208;coupling between BCP&#8208;based reagents with alkyl electrophiles.

&lt;p&gt;We show a reductive cross-coupling reaction of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP)-thianthrenium reagents and alkyl bromides, which is catalyzed by a copper/photoredox catalyst system. The reaction provides a variety of BCP-alkylated products through the formation of a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond.

         <title>Photoacid&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Network Disassembly: A Systems Approach to Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive supramolecular (SM) materials are attractive for many applications but are difficult to achieve. Here, we report a systems approach that involves blending a hydrogen&#8208;bonded SM network with a photoacid generator. The resulting material displays significant softening upon UV irradiation and functions as an efficient debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand adhesive.








Abstract
The introduction of supramolecular (SM) motifs allows the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers whose physical properties can be changed by external triggers that affect the SM binding. However, using this approach to create light&#8208;responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, SM polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross&#8208;links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;styryl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;bis(trichloromethyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self&#8208;reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the SM cross&#8208;links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto&#8208;rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand (DOD) adhesives was explored in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments.

         <title>Reengineering of a Proteomimetic Pan&#8208;Ras Inhibitor into a Ras Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes the development of proteomimetic molecular glues. We show that crosslinked helix dimers can be designed to recognize two different proteins. We converted a Ras ligand into a Ras degrader by epitope grafting, an MDM2 E3 ligase binding domain solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the dimeric scaffold. 








Abstract
Bifunctional ligands that can coax protein&#8211;protein interactions have become attractive therapeutic modalities. Herein, we describe conformationally defined helix dimers as proteomimetic molecular glues. The helix dimers can be rationally designed to engage helical protein interfaces. We previously described a synthetic Sos protein mimic, CHDSOS, as a Ras ligand that inhibits wild&#8208;type and oncogenic Ras signaling. This Sos proteomimetic consisted of a crosslinked helix dimer (CHD) that reproduced two helical domains, termed &#945;H and &#945;I, from Sos. The native &#945;H helix of Sos constitutes the primary contact surface for Sos, while &#945;I has minimal engagement. We conjectured that the &#945;I domain of CHDSOS could be reengineered to preserve Ras binding, while engaging another protein to fully leverage the contact residues available in a proteomimetic. Herein, we incorporate a second distinct binding epitope into CHDSOS, thereby generating a bispecific proteomimetic. This secondary epitope was designed based on the p53 activation domain to engage the E3 ligase MDM2 and induce complexation with Ras. The resulting lead proteomimetic, CHDBI4, associates with both MDM2 and Ras and demonstrates reduction of cellular Ras levels. Overall, the study offers a proof of concept for the development of a bispecific proteomimetic scaffold to target multiple protein interfaces.

         <title>Design Considerations of Ionic Conductive Elastomeric Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Zinc Metal Batteries with High Safety and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic conductive elastomeric electrolyte rich in high&#8208;density hydrogen bond network was constructed through the cross&#8208;linked encapsulation of PA molecules with PVA chains during solvent evaporation. Unlike the conventional hydrogel electrolytes, elastomeric electrolytes (ZICE&#8208;4) demonstrate the fast Zn2+ ion transport, uniform Zn2+ flux, high volumetric adaptability, and wide working temperature range. 








Abstract
Zn&#8722;ion batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth have impeded their application. In this study, we developed an Zn2+&#8208;ionic conductive elastomer solid&#8208;state electrolyte through the simultaneous hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking between phytic acid (PA) molecules and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The large PA molecules inside the polymer electrolyte are favorable to maintaining stretched conformation of PVA chain and uniform interpenetrating distribution, enhancing the amorphous region of PVA polymer. And the high&#8208;density hydrogen bond network constructed from PVA chains and PA molecules builds a novel transport mode to promote the efficient Zn2+ ion transport, displaying significant ion conductivity of 6.05&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C and a higher transference number of 0.68. The special viscoelasticity of the elastomer facilitates close contact with electrodes, ensuring superior interface compatibility. The assembled Zn symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle life of 2880&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the assembled Zn//VO2 full battery still maintains a capacity retention rate of 86.5% at 400 cycles under 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The development of ionic conductive elastomers offers a novel approach to solve the solid&#8208;state interface design of solid&#8208;state Zn&#8722;ion batteries.

         <title>Nonconjugated Structural Distortion Promoting the Formation of NIR Triplet States in Phenothiazine Dyes for Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through steric modification of PTZ dyes, we developed a nonconjugated structural distortion strategy that enhances ISC efficiency and prolongs triplet&#8208;state lifetime via optimized spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The optimized photosensitizer HNBS achieves oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation at ultralow doses while inducing pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death for synergistic photoimmunotherapy. 








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet&#8208;state dyes are pivotal for advanced biomedical and material science applications. Although numerous strategies have been proposed to enhance the photosensitization efficiency of dyes, significant challenges remain. Herein, we propose a novel strategy leveraging nonconjugated structural distortion to enhance triplet&#8208;state formation. This strategy, achieved by introducing steric groups at the edges of the phenothiazine (PTZ) dye framework, notably enhances intersystem crossing (ISC) and prolongs triplet&#8208;state lifetime. Based on this strategy, HNBS and HNBSe are synthesized, which exhibit exceptional triplet&#8208;state quantum yields (47.2% for HNBS and 87.7% for HNBSe) and prolonged triplet&#8208;excited&#8208;state lifetimes (21.1&#160;&#181;s for HNBS and 6.3&#160;&#181;s for HNBSe). These values substantially exceed those of conventional dyes, such as NBS (negligible and NBSe (3.2&#160;&#181;s). Under ultralow&#8208;light doses (0.45&#160;J cm&#8722;2 in vitro, and 6&#160;J cm&#8722;2 in vivo), these photosensitizers demonstrate robust tumor cell inhibition, highlighting their exceptional photosensitizing ability. Mechanistically, HNBS possesses lysosomal&#8208;targeting ability, and upon light irradiation, it induces lysosomal damage, triggering pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death. These processes promote dendritic cell maturation and T&#8208;cell differentiation, augmenting the immune response and enabling effective photoimmunotherapy.

These values substantially exceed those of conventional dyes, such as NBS (negligible and NBSe (3.2&#160;&#181;s). Under ultralow-light doses (0.45&#160;J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in vitro, and 6&#160;J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in vivo), these photosensitizers demonstrate robust tumor cell inhibition, highlighting their exceptional photosensitizing ability. Mechanistically, HNBS possesses lysosomal-targeting ability, and upon light irradiation, it induces lysosomal damage, triggering pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death. These processes promote dendritic cell maturation and T-cell differentiation, augmenting the immune response and enabling effective photoimmunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Type I&#8208;B Main&#8208;Chain Polyrotaxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing &#8220;host&#8722;guest recognition followed by click polymerization&#8221; strategy, a Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR), featuring multiple wheels and stoppers along the polymer backbone, was efficiently synthesized. The first&#8208;ever Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR network (PRN) was then constructed to unveil the structure&#8722;property relationships of the PR. The special topological structures and dynamic characteristics of the PR skeleton provided multiple energy dissipation pathways, effectively toughening and strengthening the PRN.








Abstract
Polyrotaxanes (PRs) are recognized for their outstanding conformational flexibility, making them ideal candidates for the design of high&#8208;performance mechanically interlocked materials. However, Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PRs, featuring multiple wheels and stoppers along the polymer backbone, remain underexplored due to the challenges in their design and synthesis. Herein, we introduce a facile &#8220;host&#8722;guest recognition followed by click polymerization&#8221; strategy for the synthesis of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR, which is subsequently employed to prepare the first&#8208;ever Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR network (PRN). Compared to the control whose wheels are nonslidable under applied force, the distinctive dynamic behaviors of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR impart extraordinary mechanical enhancements to PRN, with fracture strain, toughness, and puncture resistance all surging by more than 27&#8208;fold. Moreover, the combination of the host&#8722;guest recognition and multiple stoppers endows the PRN with great self&#8208;recovery capability due to the restriction of the motion range of mechanical bonds. This work not only presents a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR networks but also highlights the pivotal role of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PRs in enhancing material performance, offering valuable insights for advancing the development of dynamic polymer materials.

         <title>Leveraging Sortase A Electrostatics for Powerful Transpeptidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) is leveraged to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. The reaction is highly efficient, straightforward to implement, compatible with recombinant protein expression, and enables remarkably clean protein labeling and protein&#8208;protein coupling.








Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation is a powerful biochemical reaction to perform protein engineering. In this work, we leverage the unique electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. Importantly, the reaction proceeds with a minimal excess of nucleophile and is fast and highly efficient in the low micromolar substrate concentration range. Electrostatic assistance eliminates the need for additives or complex substrate engineering strategies, thereby giving it a broad scope. Our findings also provide fundamental insights into the influence of substrate charge on SrtA&#8208;5M activity, paving the way for further optimization of sortase A&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation reactions.

         <title>Switchable Regiodivergent Reductive Alkyl&#8211;Alkyl Coupling by Nickel Catalysis: Sorting Different Alkyl&#8211;Nickel Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;divergent reductive alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling between two different migratory alkyl halides has been developed. The reaction proceeds via tunable non&#8208;migratory or site&#8208;defined migratory alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature, providing a straightforward protocol for the alkylation of unactivated Csp3&#9472;H bonds by differentiating thermodynamic and non&#8208;thermodynamic alkyl intermediates to deliver three types of branched N&#8208;acyl amine architectures from identical starting materials.








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective and divergent functionalizations on saturated alkyl chain at specific unfunctionalized positions is a key challenge in organic chemistry and other related areas and offers unprecedented synthetic opportunities. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective and divergent alkyl&#8211;alkyl reductive coupling between two different alkyl halides has been developed. Notably, the reaction finely tunes and recognizes thermodynamic favored &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals over &#946;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, and distal ipso&#8208;alkyl radicals to deliver chemo&#8208; and position&#8208;selective alkylation of unactivated &#945;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;H of amines under reductive conditions. Moreover, the reaction selectively functionalizes one alkyl chain over two migratable alkyl chains. By just switching the catalytic parameters, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of saturated C&#9472;H bonds, and ipso&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling allow for rapid access to three types of branched aliphatic amine architectures from identical starting materials.

         <title>Supramolecularly Confined Catalysis in Polyphthalocyanine&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Frameworks Boosts Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>

Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether frameworks coating on carbon nanotubes, which not only serve as supramolecularly confined catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry but also suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. This newly designed catalysts achieve the long&#8208;term cycling operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a tiny capacity decay rate of 0.711&#8240; per cycle. Our design strategy can be potentially applied to a wider spectrum of electrochemical catalysis.








Abstract
Metal phthalocyanines are considered as potent catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) chemistry. However, their adsorption capability is deficient to inhibit polysulfides from shuttling, which in turn retards the S&#8208;redox reaction in the cathode. Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether (PPc&#8208;CE) frameworks that provide a supramolecularly confined space created with the single&#8208;atom catalytic nickel phthalocyanine nodes and crown&#8208;ether linkers as Li host. Electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal that a cooperative redox catalysis with the enhanced lithiophilicity of PPc&#8208;CE&#8208;coated carbon nanotubes (PPc&#8208;CE/CNTs) boosts Li&#8211;S redox kinetics and, meanwhile, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites for the long term. A Li||S cell employing PPc&#8208;CE/CNT catalysts delivers a high discharge capacity of 1,363 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and still retains a specific capacity of &#8764;700 mAh g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 1C. Our work provides insights into the molecular design of redox catalysts for Li&#8211;S batteries based on 2D polymers.

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Total Syntheses of Cycloaurenones and Dysiherbols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

We report the enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols via a common cyclohexadienone intermediate, that is, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition reaction. This cyclohexadienone was obtained by a bidirectional synthesis from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide, with stereocenters set by a novel Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% e.e.).








Abstract
Cycloaurenones and dysiherbols are naturally occurring sesquiterpene quinones/quinols that share a 6/6/5/6 tetracyclic carbon skeleton with either a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;decalin system containing four contiguous stereocenters, including three contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Total syntheses of cycloaurenones have not been reported. Herein, we present the first enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols based on manipulation of a common cyclohexadienone intermediate: namely, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization for cycloaurenones and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition for dysiherbols. Moreover, the key cyclohexadienone intermediate was readily accessible by a bidirectional approach from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide. The 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters were installed by an unprecedented enantioselective hydrogenation of the corresponding bis&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Weinreb amide (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).

         <title>In Situ Solid Conversion into Mechanically Adaptive LiF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase via MgF2 Precursor on Si Surface in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgF2 coating with high coating integrity is in situ constructed on Si nanoparticles. During electrochemical cycling, the MgF2 layer undergoes in situ conversion into LiF and Mg, thereby forming a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high mechanical adaptability, excellent electronic insulation, and high ionic conductivity. This unique transformed SEI layer effectively mitigates mechanical degradation and interfacial side reactions, contributing to significantly enhanced electrochemical properties of the Si anode. 








Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (&#8764;4200&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion (&#8764;300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation, and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in situ conversed MgF2 layer (with coating integrity of 94.2%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF2 layer is in situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation, and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF2&#8208;1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 10&#160;C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles). Full&#8208;cell based on the Si@MgF2&#8208;1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon&#8208;based LIBs.

         <title>Shaping of a Reactive Manganese Catalyst Enables Access to Polyfunctionalized Cyclohexanes via Enantioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H Bond Oxidation of 1,3&#8208;meso Diethers</title>

Structural shaping of a highly reactive chiral Mn&#8208;oxo species translates into exceptionally enantioselective C&#9472;H oxidation catalyst of cyclohexyl 1,3&#8208;meso diethers (up to &gt;99% ee) leading to polyfunctionalized cyclohexanes.








Abstract
Chiral polyoxygenated cyclohexanes are valuable constituents of biologically relevant products. Herein, we report a protocol for the direct access to these scaffolds via site&#8208; and enantioselective non&#8208;directed oxidation of cyclohexyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;meso diethers using aqueous H&#8322;O&#8322;. Structural shaping of a highly reactive chiral Mn&#8208;oxo species, achieved through the combination of a sterically encumbered ligand and a bulky carboxylic acid, promotes a precise fit of the substrate within the catalyst pocket, which translates into exceptional enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). Computational studies reveal that C&#9472;H oxidation proceeds via an initial hydrogen atom transfer, followed by electron transfer, leading to the formation of a chiral cationic intermediate. The resulting desymmetrized 3&#8208;methoxycyclohexanone products serve as valuable intermediates for the synthesis of bioactive cores, as they can undergo orthogonal chemical modifications to enable further structural diversification.

         <title>Rapid Access to an Enantioenriched Spiro Bisindole Directly from Indole and Acetone</title>

         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective one&#8208;pot &#8220;self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy was developed for the exceedingly convenient access to a spiro bisindole directly from indole and acetone. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole showed exceptional performance as a chiral backbone of diverse effective catalysts or ligands.








Abstract
Disclosed here is a &#8220;one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of a spiro bisindole molecule directly from indole and acetone. This convenient synthesis contrasts drastically to the typical long sequence required for other privileged C2&#8208;symmetric spirocycles. The use of an alcohol additive in cooperation with chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis proved crucial to the good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The favorable interaction between the additive and CPA was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole was demonstrated as a useful backbone of chiral catalysts/ligands.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cycloaddition for the Construction of Chiral Indole&#8208;Fused Medium&#8208; and Large&#8208;Sized Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates have been established via asymmetric organocatalysis, providing a useful protocol for constructing enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings. The biological evaluation of selected chiral indole products discovered several compounds with some extent of antitumor activity, indicating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings represents an important issue in synthetic chemistry but with significant challenges. To overcome these challenges, herein, we report highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings via organocatalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates with benzofuranyl azadienes, providing an efficient strategy for accessing these enantioenriched frameworks. By designing 2&#8208;indolylacetates as a new class of four&#8208;carbon platform molecules for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and modulating the nucleophilicity of benzofuranyl azadienes, we achieved the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral indole&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered rings and eleven&#8208; to fourteen&#8208;membered macrocycles in high yields with good enantioselectivity. This work not only demonstrates the first application of 2&#8208;indolylacetates as four&#8208;carbon platform molecules in cycloaddition reactions, but also represents the first catalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates. Furthermore, biological evaluation revealed that several chiral indole derivatives exhibit some extent of antitumor activity, indicating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole-fused medium- and large-sized rings represents an important issue in synthetic chemistry but with significant challenges. To overcome these challenges, herein, we report highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral indole-fused medium- and large-sized rings via organocatalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2-indolylacetates with benzofuranyl azadienes, providing an efficient strategy for accessing these enantioenriched frameworks.

         <title>H2S Donor Functionalized Molecular Machine for Combating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Infected Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel H2S donor functionalized molecular machine, ACR&#8208;DM&#8208;HS, with combination of antibacteria and anti&#8208;inflammation to accelerate angiogenesis through membrane disruption, ROS generation, and H2S releasing was developed for synergistic therapy of multiple resistant bacteria&#8208;infected chronic wound, which offers a promising treatment approach for combating bacterial multidrug resistance and tackling chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds are a worldwide medical challenge due to the complex and multifaceted etiologies, including bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis. Developing a comprehensive strategy integrating antibiosis and anti&#8208;inflammation to promote revascularization and accelerate wound healing is highly desirable. Nevertheless, current therapeutic methods still face two major challenges: 1) how to combat bacterial drug resistance, 2) how to achieve spatiotemporal control over bacterial elimination and inflammation reduction. To address these issues, a novel H2S donor functionalized molecular machine (MM), ACR&#8208;DM&#8208;HS, was developed. It selectively binds to and disturbs the bacterial membrane through a light&#8208;active vibronic&#8208;driven mechanochemical action (VDA), which synergizes with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently eradicate multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilms, and conquers the evolution of bacterial resistance. Furthermore, it releases H2S in infected tissues to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors, promote angiogenesis, and accelerate the healing of diabetic wounds in vivo. This work provides an integrated strategy combining antibiotics and anti&#8208;inflammation to treat with multidrug resistance bacterial&#8208;infected chronic wounds.

Visible light/pH dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with reversible stimuli&#8208;chromic characteristics were fabricated through self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers, displaying reversible shape transitions, repeatable acidochromism from yellow to pink, and fluorochromism performance.

Abstract
Endowing dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with reversible stimuli&#8208;chromic and fluorochromic performances offers a prospective yet challenging strategy for achieving high&#8208;level information encryption and anticounterfeiting. Herein, starting from rational synthesis of visible light/pH&#8208;responsive integrated azobenzene monomer, side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers were elaborately crafted using a moderate epoxy&#8208;amino click&#8208;polycondensation. Followed by subsequent solution self&#8208;assembly, dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a diameter of &#8764;253&#160;nm and a vesicular thickness of &#8764;2.1&#160;nm were subtly produced based on the pendant hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism. The photoisomerization of azobenzene units and protonation of tertiary amines within UTPSs were accountable for the visible&#8208;light&#8208; or pH&#8208;triggered reversible shape and physicochemical transitions (i.e., color, size, diameter, vesicular thickness, zeta potential, fluorescent intensity) as well as repeatable acidochromism from yellow to pink and recyclable fluorochromism, respectively. Benefiting from these attractive traits, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept 2D quick response code was meticulously crafted using the stimuli&#8208;chromic UTPSs into patterning lithography, showcasing a multilevel decryption, favorable reversibility, and preferable recyclability for advanced information security.

         <title>Ultraselective Permeable Polyamide Membranes Prepared via Interfacial Polymerization of Alkane and Deep Eutectic Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green interfacial polymerization platform that can eliminate side reactions was designed to precisely regulate the preparation of narrow pore size polyamide membranes through a dynamic 3D hydrogen bonding network. In addition, the platform has unprecedented universality, and the membranes produced have an order of magnitude higher selectivity for NaCl/Na2SO4, as well as excellent permeability.








Abstract
Conventional alkane/water interfacial polymerization encounters significant challenges in constructing polyamide membranes with precise nanoconfinement. This requires advanced strategies that simultaneously slow the diffusion kinetics and suppress side reactions, facilitating the formation of a well&#8208;defined pore architecture. Herein, we introduced an alkane/deep eutectic solvent (DES) interfacial polymerization approach, allowing the preparation of ultraselective permeable polyamide membranes. The DES, acting as an anhydrous solvent, effectively prevents side reactions, while its robust hydrogen bonding network finely regulates the diffusion behavior of amine monomers and induces the assembly of oligomers, affording a polyamide membrane with uniform subnanometer pores. Notably, the strong hydrogen bonding network of DES enhances the solvation of amine monomers, which further promotes the tuning of the membrane structures and functions. The polyamide membrane produced using specific DES (D&#8208;PA) revealed an exceptional NaCl/Na2SO4 (165.8) separation selectivity, an order of magnitude larger than that of conventional polyamide membranes, coupled with impressive water permeance of up to 18.4&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1. This strategy offers a paradigm shift in the fabrication of ultraselective permeable polyamide membranes for advanced water purification system.

         <title>A Universal P&#8208;Type Heterointerface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal p&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite was constructed using the heterocyclic dipolar compound imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI), enabling effective hole extraction from perovskite to SAMs and significantly reducing charge recombination. As a result, the optimized solar cells reached 26.05% and demonstrated excellent stability.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells with self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal p&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more p&#8208;type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The p&#8208;type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best&#8208;performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000&#160;h under nitrogen&#8208;filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800&#160;h at 55&#160;&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000&#160;h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverted perovskite solar cells with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long-term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal p-type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more p-type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The p-type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best-performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000&#160;h under nitrogen-filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800&#160;h at 55&#160;&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000&#160;h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded Shape Memory Actuators</title>

Supramolecular chalcogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers incorporating Se&#8943;N interactions exhibit distinct shape memory and actuation properties. Stronger Se&#8943;N ChBs enable programmable one&#8208;way and two&#8208;way SME, while weaker S&#8943;N ChBs fail to induce actuation. Solid&#8208;state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and DFT reveal the molecular interactions governing ChB&#8208;driven mechanical responses.








Abstract
Supramolecular liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) incorporating chalcogen bonds (ChBs) have been synthesized and investigated for shape memory and actuation properties. LCEs featuring strong Se&#8943;N ChBs (&#8722;40 to &#8722;43&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) exhibit both shape memory effects (SME) and reversible actuation, while those with weaker S&#8943;N ChBs (&#8722;32 to &#8722;34&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) do not. The Se&#8943;N&#8208;based LCEs transition from one&#8208;way to two&#8208;way SME after three days at room temperature, enabling programmable 2D/3D shape transformations and rewritable surface patterns. They also enable the fabrication of light&#8208;powered crawling robots as well as temperature&#8208;responsive knot&#8208;like actuators. These results highlight the critical role of the ChB strength and specificity in designing functional materials. Solid&#8208;state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations provide further molecular&#8208;level insights into ChB interactions, laying the groundwork for advanced supramolecular actuators and shape&#8208;morphing LCEs.

We presented the rational design and synthesis of two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs engineered with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites for selective gold recovery. Their comprehensive gold recovery performance is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity, ultrafast adsorption kinetics, and near&#8208;perfect selectivity, resulting from the synergistic effect of redox interactions, electrostatic interactions, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Developing efficient adsorbents for precious metals, especially gold recovery, necessitates the integration of multiple critical properties, including high adsorption capacity, rapid adsorption kinetics, and exceptional selectivity, posing significant scientific challenges with substantial economic and environmental implications. Herein, we report a strategy to achieve highly efficient gold adsorption through synergistic effects of nitrogen and oxygen active sites into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs (NKCOF&#8208;77 and &#8208;78) with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites are rationally designed and synthesized via a Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction approach. Notably, the comprehensive gold recovery performance for NKCOF&#8208;77 is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity (up to 3225&#160;mg g&#8722;1), ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5&#160;min), and near&#8208;perfect selectivity (&gt;99.9% with 10 competitive cations and anions). Moreover, the COFs show exceptional ability for gold recovery from real e&#8208;waste solutions, demonstrating tremendous practical application potential. Various experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that strategically incorporating high&#8208;density nitrogen and oxygen active sites is crucial in&#160;significantly enhancing the gold adsorption capacity. This work provides a novel strategy for designing COFs as precious metal adsorbents, highlighting their promising potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Employment of l&#8208;Citrulline as an Effective Molecular Bridge for Regulating the Buried Interface of Perovskite Solar Cells to Achieve High Efficiency and Good Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;Citrulline (CIT), with amino acid end groups (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and a urea end group (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2), functions as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The optimized PSC device (0.07065 cm2) achieved an impressive champion PCE of 25.95%. The solar module with an active area of 23.26 cm2 achieved a PCE of 22.70%, which is one of the highest values reported recently using the slot&#8208;die coating method. The strategy offers valuable insights to advance the industrialization of large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Suppressing the defects from SnO2 and perovskite interface is essential for the fabrication of large&#8208;area n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the needed lifetime and efficiency for commercialization. Here, we report the employment of l&#8208;citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and urea (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I&#8722;. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain&#8208;size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive &#948; phase to result in suppressed trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent&#8208;free slot&#8208;die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.

         <title>Unlocking Precision in Biomass Conversion Through Functional Ligand Engineering of Lewis Acidic MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a strategic combination of sulfo&#8208;functionalized ligands and terephthalic acid, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;based catalysts with tunable Lewis acidity were synthesized, where the specific chemical state of each sulfo group served as a critical regulator of catalytic activity in glucose isomerization. This precise control enabled unambiguous correlation between acid site characteristics and reaction performance.








Abstract
Glucose isomerization to fructose is a key factor in cellulosic biomass utilization. Thus, achieving highly efficient fructose production and understanding the dominant reaction route remain crucial goals. Hereby, this study refines a precise ligand engineering strategy applied to the typical metal&#8211;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66, generating a series of Lewis acidic UiO&#8208;66&#8208;based catalysts with only subtle structural adjustments. Among all, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;pCl&#8208;SBA possessed the strongest Lewis acidity and the best glucose isomerization performance. Further investigation elaborates the crucial contribution of both Lewis acid amount and specific acid nature to enhanced catalytic reactivity, given a high fructose yield of 47% at glucose conversion of 63%, achieved with a UiO&#8208;66&#8208;STPA(49%). The increased acid density with specific Lewis acid strength is computationally identified to promote glucose polarization, facilitating the isomerization process. Density functional theory calculations reveal that incorporating functionalized ligands and increasing their proportion markedly decrease both the electron density at Zr sites and the material's band gap, which in turn benefits the Lewis acid strength and catalytic activity enhancement. This work highlights the significance of Lewis sites&#8217; nature and its effect on glucose isomerization performance.

Hereby, this study refines a precise ligand engineering strategy applied to the typical metal&#8211;organic framework, UiO-66, generating a series of Lewis acidic UiO-66-based catalysts with only subtle structural adjustments. Among all, UiO-66-&lt;i&gt;pCl&lt;/i&gt;-SBA possessed the strongest Lewis acidity and the best glucose isomerization performance. Further investigation elaborates the crucial contribution of both Lewis acid amount and specific acid nature to enhanced catalytic reactivity, given a high fructose yield of 47% at glucose conversion of 63%, achieved with a UiO-66-STPA(49%). The increased acid density with specific Lewis acid strength is computationally identified to promote glucose polarization, facilitating the isomerization process. Density functional theory calculations reveal that incorporating functionalized ligands and increasing their proportion markedly decrease both the electron density at Zr sites and the material's band gap, which in turn benefits the Lewis acid strength and catalytic activity enhancement. This work highlights the significance of Lewis sites&#8217; nature and its effect on glucose isomerization performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Elaboration of Confined Surfaces Steers C&#9472;C Coupling Pathway for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>

A novel gasphilic Cu2O nanoparticle dispersed within the hierarchically porous carbon matrix as a high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR electrocatalyst switches in the reaction pathways from ethanol to ethylene during CO2RR at ampere&#8208;level current, depending on the multiscale microenvironment engineering. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene achieved is as high as &#8764;71% with a partial current density of 513.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Microenvironmental engineering of electrocatalysts is pivotal for directing reaction pathways and stabilizing key intermediates in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon products, but it has yet to meet the industrial requirement for selectively producing a most desired product, such as ethylene or ethanol, at a steady above&#8208;ampere current level. Herein, a topotactic conversion cum covalent functionalization strategy is invoked to craft a catalyst with confined and modulated surfaces that can bias the reaction heavily for ethylene production with a 22&#8208;fold boost in the ethylene/ethanol ratio. The well&#8208;tuned covalent structural motif of &#9472;Si&#9472;O&#9472;Cu&#9472; on PDMS&#8208;Cu2O/C dramatically elevates the C2H4&#8208;forming activity with a faradaic efficiency reaching up to 71% and a high partial current density of 513.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations unveil the ultralow coordination number and the upshifted d&#8208;band center. Notably, modulating the d&#8208;band center with the covalently elaborated surfaces allows control of the adsorption energies of CHO* and other intermediates along the ethylene path, largely lowering energy barriers for the key steps, particularly the formation of CH2CHO*. This work sheds light on the microenvironment modulation at the surface bonding to mesoscopic scales to precisely control catalytic processes and steer reaction pathways toward the target product.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven O&#8208;Glycosylation with Selenoglycosides Mediated by Chalcogen Bonding to Umemoto's Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light irradiation of solutions of phenylselenoglycosides and Umemoto's reagent in the presence of alcohols results in often high&#8208;yielding formation of O&#8208;glycosidic products. Experimental and computational work suggests that chalcogen&#8208;bonded electron&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes are critical intermediates in this process which may proceed through photoinduced electron transfer.








Abstract
The activation of chalcogenoglycosides for O&#8208;glycosylation typically involves strong electrophiles requiring low temperature. Herein, we demonstrate that visible&#8208;light irradiation of selenoglycosides in the presence of Umemoto's reagent results in often high&#8208;yielding O&#8208;glycosylation. We provide evidence that this process is mediated by a novel mode of reactivity, specifically photoinduced electron transfer within a chalcogen&#8208;bonded complex.

         <title>Harnessing Solvation Chemistry of Pentavalent Vanadium for Wide&#8208;Temperature Range Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level investigation of V(V) solvation transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3 via a four&#8208;step mechanism is presented, with the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. This insight enables V(V) stabilization via proton and anion coordination, and a mixed&#8208;acid electrolyte was developed with exceptional stability at 50&#160;&#176;C for VFB.








Abstract
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable solutions for storing renewable energies. However, the poor thermal stability of pentavalent vanadium [V(V)] electrolyte, manifested as V2O5 precipitation at high temperatures, leads to more critical heat management, low energy density, and even low reliability. The unclear dynamic solvation chemistry of V(V) ions brings difficulties in solving the above issues intrinsically. Herein, we investigated solvation structures and dynamic evolution of V(V) electrolyte using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). For the first time, we clarified the transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3, identifying the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. Based on this, we developed stabilization strategies through anion coordination and proton concentration control. The incorporation of HCl and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid improved the thermal stability of V(V) electrolytes remarkably. The optimized electrolyte showed no precipitation during 30&#8208;day static tests at 50 &#176;C, enabling stable cycling performance of 3000 cycles in VFB single cells. Further demonstration in a kW&#8208;scale stack achieved over 1000 cycles, validating the scalability and viability. Our work provides insights into the solvation chemistry of V(V) species, paving the way to improve the reliability and energy density of a VFB system.

         <title>A Synergistic Photocatalysis&#8211;Electrocatalysis System for Efficient Hydrogen Generation and Energy&#8208;Saving Benzylamine Oxidative Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

A synergistic photocatalysis&#8211;electrocatalysis system addresses the I3&#8722; light shielding in HI splitting and achieves efficient H2 generation and energy&#8208;saving benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The Re0.5Mo0.5S2&#8208;modified MAPbI3 photocatalyst generates 875.4&#160;&#181;mol of H2 in 4 h, and the electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction coupled with benzylamine oxidation can operate at a low potential of 0.44&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting represents a promising tactic for H2 generation, but the light&#8208;shielding effect induced by the generated I3&#8722; greatly impedes subsequent reactions. A critical challenge in this field lies in achieving the timely reduction of I3&#8722; while avoiding the use of additional sacrificial agents, such as H3PO2. Herein, we develop a synergistic photocatalysis&#8211;electrocatalysis system to address this challenge and achieve efficient H2 generation and benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The photocatalytic component features a Re0.5Mo0.5S2 cocatalyst&#8208;modified MAPbI3 with efficient charge separation and ample active sites, achieving a remarkable H2 generation of 875.4&#160;&#181;mol within 4&#160;h through HI splitting.&#160;The subsequent electrocatalytic module can operate at a low potential (only 0.44&#160;V to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to reduce the generated I3&#8722; and oxidize benzylamine to value&#8208;added chemicals. After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H2 generation. The synergistic system establishes a sustainable catalytic cycle mediated by I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couples, enabling continuous photocatalytic H2 generation from HI splitting and energy&#8208;saving electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidative upgrading.

The photocatalytic component features a Re&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cocatalyst-modified MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with efficient charge separation and ample active sites, achieving a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation of 875.4&#160;&#181;mol within 4&#160;h through HI splitting.&#160;The subsequent electrocatalytic module can operate at a low potential (only 0.44&#160;V to reach 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to reduce the generated I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and oxidize benzylamine to value-added chemicals. After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. The synergistic system establishes a sustainable catalytic cycle mediated by I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox couples, enabling continuous photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation from HI splitting and energy-saving electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidative upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted E&#8208;selective Asymmetric Crotylboration of Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Silyl Crotylboronate with Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8212;a polar alcoholic solvent that has been underutilized in allylboration&#8212;enables otherwise challenging (E)&#8208;selective crotylboration of enantioenriched quaternary &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates with aldehydes. HFIP's strong hydrogen bonding effect increases the Lewis acidity of the boron center and the steric effect of Bpin, resulting in high yields and (E)&#8208;selectivity.








Abstract
Polyketide synthesis consistently requires the development of linchpin&#8208;type allylboron reagents, such as &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates. Traditionally, these reagents feature &#945;&#8208;tertiary substitution and are used in aprotic solvents, typically yielding homoallylic alcohols with disubstituted (Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes. Here, we report the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched quaternary &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates via stereospecific allylic Matteson homologation. We further demonstrate that hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8212;a polar alcoholic solvent that has been underutilized in allylboration&#8212;not only enhances reaction reactivity but also overrides the typical (Z)&#8208;selectivity, enabling access to the otherwise challenging (E)&#8208;selective products. The method enables the rapid construction of (E)&#8208;anti&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;oxy motif, a structural unit frequently found in polyketides, and allows the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of PM050463. DFT calculations suggest that HFIP's strong hydrogen bonding effect increases the Lewis acidity of the boron center and the steric effect of Bpin, resulting in high yields and (E)&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>A Neutral Single&#8208;Molecule Carrier for Delivery of Phosphonate Drugs</title>

The first application of a neutral anion receptor as a &#8220;single&#8208;molecule carrier&#8221; for targeted delivery of phosphonate drugs into living cells through anion coordination.








Abstract
Phosphate/phosphonate&#8208;based drugs (PDs), as multinegative, hydrophilic molecules, face the greatest difficulty in diffusion across biological membranes, leading to poor bioavailability. Conventional drug delivery strategies to overcome this issue, including utilizing small&#8208;molecule prodrugs or nanoparticle carriers, often suffer from case&#8208;specific modifications or uncertainties in drug loading. Inspired by the anion coordination chemistry of natural phosphate transporters and artificial anion receptors, here, we present the first use of a neutral anion receptor, i.e., bis(tripodal hexaurea) cage 1, as a &#8220;single&#8208;molecule carrier&#8221; for the delivery of PDs into living cells. Cage 1 features advantages of molecular&#8208;level encapsulation, enhanced intracellular accumulation, subcellular targeting, responsive drug release, and broad adaptability. It enhances PD accumulation in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing the cellular uptake of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;phosphate/phosphonate substrates by up to 45&#8208;fold via a macropinocytosis&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathway. This work demonstrates the potential of neutral anion receptors to serve as single&#8208;molecule carriers and offers a promising solution for improving PDs bioavailability, advancing the development of antitumor phosphate/phosphonate&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Enantioselective Immobilization of Nonprecious Metal Complexes on Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Improved Single&#8208;Site Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective immobilization of chiral Co(salen) complexes on the surface of chiral &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs enables axial coordination of Co(II) centers with COF linkages, which tautomerize from keto&#8208;enamine to enol&#8208;imine upon binding. This enantiomeric assembly enhances Co(II) reducibility and allows for inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer, leading to remarkable photocatalytic H&#8322; evolution without additional precious metals.








Abstract
The noncovalent assembly of molecular catalysts into photocatalytic systems represents a pivotal strategy for exploring single&#8208;site heterogenous catalysts, excluding the need for elaborate functionalization design. However, the reliance on weak noncovalent interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces) often leads to inefficient outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer and inferior structural stability. Herein, we report the enantioselective immobilization of cobalt&#8208;based molecular catalysts with chiral tetradentate ligands onto the surface of a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic framework (COF) synthesized through chirality induction. The enantiomeric assembly enables axial coordination between the molecular catalysts and the chiral COF, accompanied by enamine&#8208;to&#8208;imine tautomerization. Leveraging efficient inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer, the resulting composite exhibits a significantly enhanced H2 evolution rate (5.70&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and sustained performance without the use of precious metals. The enantiomeric assembly strategy on a COF platform demonstrates a viable approach to improve both the stability and activity of molecular catalysts, thereby expanding the design paradigm of single&#8208;site photocatalysts.

         <title>Introducing Functional Groups Into B&#8592;N Organic Frameworks with Permanent Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionality of crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) is engineered by introducing diverse dangling groups. Notably, the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;5 exhibits superior reversible NH&#8323; adsorption compared with their less&#8208; or nonfunctionalized counterparts. Combining high surface areas, low cost, and exceptional sustainability, these functionalized frameworks represent a promising platform for advanced applications.








Abstract
Crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) have garnered increasing interest on account of their crystallinity, porosity, and processability. However, strategies for introducing functions into BNOFs remain largely unexplored. In this work, a series of functionalized BNOFs, named BNOF&#8208;n (n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;9), have been designed and synthesized using a mixed&#8208;monomer assembly strategy. The obtained materials share structural similarities but reveal distinct functional groups, demonstrating excellent chemical stability, high surface areas, and remarkable regenerability. Notably, BNOF&#8208;5, functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups, achieves exceptional reversible NH3 adsorption capacity (up to 10.0&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K), significantly surpassing that of the nonfunctionalized BNOF&#8208;1 (5.6&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) and the less&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;7 (7.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1), thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the functionalization strategy. Remarkably, the damaged BNOF&#8208;5 can be efficiently repaired through facile regeneration, highlighting its outstanding recyclability. This work demonstrates the first attempt at functionalization methodology in BNOFs, extending their potential toward diverse applications.

This work demonstrates the first attempt at functionalization methodology in BNOFs, extending their potential toward diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol by Cu4 Clusters with Adjacent Cu Single Atoms Anchored on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst composed of Cu4 clusters and adjacent Cu single atoms anchored on carbon nitride was prepared via a two&#8208;step calcination process. The synergistic effect between Cu4 clusters and Cu single atoms could lower the C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier and make it one of the most efficient catalysts for CO2 to ethanol via photocatalysis.








Abstract
An efficient photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3CH2OH conversion comprising atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu4) and single Cu sites coordinated with 2 N and 1 O anchored on two&#8208;step calcinated C3N4 (Cu4/Cu1@CN) is reported. It was found to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to ethanol with production rate of 154&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98%, the yield rate and selectivity exceed most of the reported results for ethanol production. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that the high efficiency of this catalyst arises from the strong synergy between Cu4 clusters and adjacent Cu single atoms, which facilitates OC&#9472;CO coupling and promotes ethanol production.

A comprehensive understanding of the concurrent capacity and stability enhancement mechanisms attributed to Nb&#8208;doping and highlights the significant potential of the synergistic regulation of mechanical and chemical coupling in improving the capacity and lifespan of NRLOs by Nb&#8208;doping.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) materials are considered highly promising cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their practical application is limited by capacity loss and interface instability caused by chemical and mechanical failure during cycling. Doping has been identified as a direct and effective method to address these challenges. However, mechanistic understanding of doping enhanced electrochemical performance is still unclear. In this study, the introduction of high&#8208;valent Nb ions was employed to achieve mechanical&#8211;chemical coupling regulation, thereby concurrently improving the capacity and cycle life of NRLO. First, Nb5+ doping was conducted to refine secondary grains, achieving a &#8220;grain refinement&#8221; effect similar to that in ceramics and alloys, while further stabilizing the grain boundaries. The intergrain fusion structure of NCM811&#8208;0.5Nb effectively dissipates lattice strain under highly delithiated state, suppresses oxygen loss, and prevents cracks that lead to fracture during cycling. Moreover, Nb doping stabilizes the monoclinic phase during phase transitions and promotes the formation of highly stable spinel twin boundaries after cycling. This effectively reduces the Li diffusion barrier, leading to improved reversible specific capacity and rate capability. Lastly, the strong Nb&#9472;O bonding restrains oxygen release and transition metal/Li antisite mixing, thus mitigate rock&#8208;salt phase formation. This study demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concurrent capacity and stability enhancement mechanisms attributed to Nb&#8208;doping and highlights the significant potential of the synergistic regulation of mechanical and chemical coupling in improving the capacity and lifespan of NRLOs by Nb&#8208;doping.

         <title>Utilizing the Mn(II) Dissolution&#8208;Induced Vacancy for Optimum Mg2+ Storage of Spinel Mn3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are two significant factors necessary for the cathode materials of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion energy storage devices as follows: one is the storage mechanism of Mg2+ that can achieve enhanced Mg2+ diffusion kinetics and bring higher power density; the other is the high structural stability to achieve long lifespan. The tetrahedral vacancy reversible insertion/extraction mechanism by Mn(II) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg2+ energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan. 








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based oxide can theoretically exert the multivalent advantages of an aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion cathode due to its redox activity and abundant crystal structure. However, sluggish diffusion kinetics of Mg2+ and Mn dissolution limit the rate performance and structure stability. Herein, we successfully utilize the notorious dissolution of Mn(II) tetrahedral site contributed vacancies for packaging optimum Mg2+ storage of a popular spinel Mn3O4 electrode. Such mechanism reverses the sluggish diffusion kinetics. Moreover, merited by the common ion effect and drug dissolution, a suitable preaddition of Mn2+ to electrolyte inhibit Mn(III) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework. Impressively, the cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 and a stable cycle performance of 2000 cycles with 94.9% retention. Our research shows that reversible insertion/extraction at vacancies and effective stabilization of spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg2+ ion energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan.

Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;based photon up&#8208;conversion (TTA&#8208;UC) system using an anthracene&#8208;based UC emission by assembling multiple chromophores linked to a boron to enhance TTA rate constant. Structural fluctuations driven by vibronic motion induce picosecond intramolecular triplet exciton hopping, expanding the triplet exciton distribution and enhancing intermolecular TTA reactivity.








Abstract
Photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) is a well&#8208;known process that converts low&#8208;energy light into higher&#8208;energy light. This process has attracted attention for its potential in various fields, including light&#8208;emitting devices, power generation and medical applications. It is desirable to develop TTA&#8208;UC materials of TTA emitters with large TTA rate constants (kTTA). However, molecular design to accelerate the bimolecular rate constant of kTTA has not been considered. We present a strategy to manipulate kTTA by assembling multiple chromophores linked to a boron in a rotationally symmetric manner, causing asymmetric motions by a localized triplet exciton. We have studied tri(9&#8208;anthryl)borane, which consists of three anthracenes linked via boron, as a TTA emitter. Time&#8208;resolved luminescence measurements confirmed that kTTA is improved compared to the conventional TTA&#8208;UC system using DPA, an anthracene&#8208;based monomer. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that the improvement in kTTA is due to fast intramolecular triplet exciton hopping coupled with vibrational motions in the trimer molecule, which extends the reactivity at the collision distance between the excitons through the pseudo&#8208;rotational motions. This molecular design that enhances TTA reactivity is expected to contribute to the future development of TTA&#8208;UC materials for sensing fluid environment.

         <title>Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy Reveals Spatially Resolved Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction Photocatalyst</title>

In situ KPFM reveals charge&#8208;transfer mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. Upon light illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors rises, generating a built&#8208;in electric field that drives photogenerated carrier separation. Electrons accumulate on CdS, lowering its surface photovoltage (SPV), while holes accumulate on BiOBr, elevating its SPV above that of the bare semiconductors, highlighting efficient charge separation.








Abstract
S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions hold great promise for photocatalysis, yet a comprehensive understanding of their charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms remains limited. While time&#8208;resolved techniques have provided valuable insights, the spatial resolution of charge transfer at the material surface remains underexplored. Here, we employ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, revealing spatially resolved details. Our findings show that upon illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors increases, but a built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) persists within the heterojunction. Electrons accumulate on the surface of the reduction semiconductor (RS), resulting in a surface photovoltage (SPV) lower than that of the individual semiconductor, while holes accumulate on the oxidation semiconductor (OS) surface, producing an SPV higher than that of the bare material. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to a remarkable increase in charge separation, with 11 additional photogenerated electrons and 3722 additional holes compared to the bare CdS and BiOBr. These results offer critical insights into the spatially resolved charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions.

         <title>Functional Dendrimer Nanogels for DNA Delivery and Gene Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrimer nanogels are designed by emulsion&#8208;free method, endowing them with dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique characters, dendrimer nanogels display high gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies with low side effects, thus solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of conventional cationic colloidal vectorsin gene delivery.








Abstract
Solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors is one of the biggest challenges in gene delivery. Cationic dendrimer assemblies with hierarchical structure, smart and biomimetic behaviors have been developed for drug/gene delivery in vivo. Among different dendrimer assemblies, the dendrimer&#8208;based nanogels were not intensively studied due to complicated synthesis and unknown properties. Here, for the first time, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels with high yield and purity, tunable size, uniform morphology, and good colloidal stability were synthesized using the emulsion&#8208;free method, which cannot be obtained by the miniemulsion method. Importantly, the dendrimer nanogels integrate the advantages of low&#8208;generation dendrimer and stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer, thus achieving dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine units, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique properties, dendrimer nanogels can &#8220;temporarily&#8221; acquire high charge density through the covalent crosslinking of low&#8208;generation dendrimer for improved DNA compression, promoted cell internalization and lysosomal escape, and efficient DNA delivery, followed by self&#8208;triggered aminolysis into small dendrimers to control DNA release, reduce cytotoxicity, and facilitate metabolism in vivo. Compared to high&#8208;generation dendrimers, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels display higher gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies, and lower side effects simultaneously. This work provides a facile strategy for the preparation of low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels that break up the contradiction between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors in gene therapy. This innovative approach to construct low&#8208;generation dendrimers into smart dendrimer nanogels will have broad applicability in clinical translation.

         <title>Homogenized Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rigid SAM (PhPAPy), designed to leverage the structural tunability of SAMs for achieving uniform substrate coverage with a single molecule. The high&#8208;quality HTL based on PhPAPy effectively minimizes direct perovskite&#8211;electrode contact, reduces defect density, and suppresses nonradiative recombination at the buried interface. The champion device achieved a certified reverse&#8208;scan PCE of 26.74% while maintaining T95&#160;=&#160;2000&#160;h long&#8208;term stability (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly improved, driven by advancements in self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs). However, achieving homogeneous SAM coverage on substrates remains challenging, directly impacting device performance and stability. Here, we present (4&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (PhPAPy), a SAM with a rigid aromatic ring structure. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that this rigidity limits rotational freedom, promoting a near&#8208;vertical molecular orientation on the substrate. Additionally, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the planar pyrene rings enhance molecular packing, forming a homogeneous and dense SAM layer. As a result, the uniform PhPAPy effectively minimizes perovskite&#8211;substrate direct contact, enhances the interfacial properties, reduces buried interface defects, and improves both efficiency and stability. With PhPAPy SAM, the assembled inverted PSCs achieve a certified reverse&#8208;scanning power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.74% and a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 26.12% (from National Institute of Metrology in China). These devices retain 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C and ambient humidity (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Sustainable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries via Molecularly Engineered Polyiodide Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable &#8220;polyiodide reservoir&#8221;, engineered by the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities within covalent organic cages, is proposed as the iodine host. The resulting zinc&#8211;iodine battery demonstrates a capacity retention of 90.1% after 4000 cycles at 5 C and maintains 85.4% of its initial capacity after three reuse cycles.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for safe and sustainable energy storage but are hindered by polyiodide shuttling, leading to rapid capacity decay and limited cyclability. In this work, we propose a &#8220;polyiodide reservoirs&#8221; concept, utilizing iodophilic covalent organic cages to confine polyiodide through multiple noncovalent interactions. By precisely engineering the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities around 3D cavities, these cages evolve from open to near&#8208;enclosed structure, achieving molecular&#8208;level polyiodide entrapment. The optimized superphane cage (18 N&#8208;active sites) enables a ZIB with 90.1% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 C, even under extreme conditions (58.9 wt% iodine content within the cage and an iodine area loading of 3.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 in the cathode). Importantly, the cage's solubility&#8208;driven regeneration capability retains 85.4% initial capacity over three reuse cycles. This work establishes covalent organic superphanes as a transformative platform for long&#8208;life ZIBs, offering a dual solution to shuttle suppression and electrode sustainability through structural confinement and dynamic recyclability.

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion Induced by Topological Phase Transition in a Potassium Zinc Phosphate Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
KZnP3O9 exhibits record negative thermal expansion (&#916;V/V&#160;= &#8722;11.49%) through an unprecedented topological phase transition, where infinite (PO4)&#8734; chains reorganize into discrete P3O9 rings. The synergistic couplings among K+ sublattice compression, covalent bond rearrangement, and vibrational destabilization drive this giant negative thermal expansion.








Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials exhibit the counterintuitive property of volume contraction upon heating, which is critical for precision engineering applications. While significant progress has been made in NTE material discovery and mechanism understanding, developing cost&#8208;effective systems with strong NTE effects remains challenging. Here we report that an economical phosphate material, KZn(PO3)3, which demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking volumetric contraction (&#916;V/V&#160;= &#8722;11.49%) during its low&#8208;temperature to high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This exceptional NTE behavior originates from an unprecedented topological phase transition involving structural reorganization from infinite (PO4)&#8734;&#8208;chains (C&#8734; symmetry) to discrete P3O9&#8208;rings (C3 symmetry). The variable&#8208;cell nudged elastic band, ab initio molecular dynamics, and self&#8208;consistent phonon calculations reveal a threefold mechanism: (1) reduced K&#8211;K distance minimize electrostatic repulsion, (2) covalent bond rearrangement enables the chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformation, and (3) pronounced vibrational modes of O1 atoms destabilize the anionic chains, promoting their cleavage. Concurrently, these cooperative effects drive the observed giant NTE, while the resulting hexagonal&#8208;closed&#8208;packed (hcp) K+ sublattice further enhances structural contraction.

         <title>Blocky Selective Postpolymerization C&#8211;H Functionalization of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8211;H functionalization of polyolefins in a solvent&#8208;swollen semicrystalline state favored selectivity for blocky microstructures. Blocky microstructures preserved the crystallinity size, percent, and strength of polyolefins in comparison to their random analogues.








Abstract
C&#8211;H functionalization of commodity polyolefins affords functional materials derived from a high&#8208;volume, low&#8208;cost resource. However, current postpolymerization modification strategies result in randomly distributed functionalization along the length of the polymer backbone, which has a negative impact on the crystallinity of the resultant polymers, and thus the thermomechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate an amidyl radical mediated C&#8211;H functionalization of polyolefins to access blocky microstructures, which exhibit a higher crystalline fraction, larger crystallite size, and improved mechanical properties compared to their randomly functionalized analogues. Taking inspiration from the site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization of small molecules, we leverage the steric protection provided by crystallites and target polymer functionalization to amorphous domains in a semicrystalline polyolefin gel. The beneficial outcomes of blocky functionalization are independent of the identity of the pendant functional group that is installed through functionalization. The decoupling of functional group incorporation and crystallinity highlights the promise in accessing nonrandom microstructures through selective functionalization to circumvent traditional tradeoffs in postpolymerization modification, with potential impact in advanced materials and upcycling plastic waste.

         <title>Structural Origin of Spin&#8208;Orbit Splitting of 1P Orbitals of Icosahedral Au13 Superatom Protected by Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;orbit (SO) splitting of the superatomic 1P orbitals in thiolate&#8208;protected Au13 superatoms were investigated. Cryogenic anion photoelectron spectroscopy and fully relativistic calculation including SO coupling revealed the 1P orbitals of the Au13 and Au@Ag12 superatomic cores undergo SO splitting, while not in the Ag13 core.








Abstract
The key structural factors underlying the spin&#8208;orbit (SO) splitting of the 1P orbitals in thiolate&#8208;protected Au13 superatoms were investigated using cryogenic anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and two&#8208;component density functional theory (2c&#8208;DFT) calculations. PES revealed that the 1P orbitals of the Au13 and Au@Ag12 superatomic cores undergo splitting, whereas those of the Ag13 core do not. According to 2c&#8208;DFT calculations, the SO splitting of the 1P orbitals of the Au13 superatom stems from the symmetry&#8208;dictated coupling between the 6p orbitals of the central Au atom and the 1P orbitals formed by the surrounding icosahedral Au12 shell, both of which are split by SO effects.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness ~ 1.5&#8208;2.6 nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#8211;O bond contraction from 2.06 &#197; to 1.89 &#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Recyclable Hybrid Polymer Networks using Whole Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whole&#8208;plant biomass from non&#8208;agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole&#8208;cell spirulina, a green&#8208;blue algae, into robust hybrid algae&#8208;polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The hybrid algae&#8208;based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all&#8208;synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled hybrid materials which is facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust hybrid materials, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Single&#8208;Atom Metal Oxide Catalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high&#8208;activity candidates. High&#8208;throughput screening of 261 transition metal single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides (MSA&#8208;MOx) identified nine top&#8208;performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential &lt; 0.5 V), including MnSA&#8208;RuO2 and FeSA&#8208;TiO2 (theoretical overpotential &lt; 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant&#8208;potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of MnSA&#8208;RuO2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, machine learning prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Photodegradable and Thermo&#8211;reversible, Soft, Transparent Dithioacetal Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8211;reversible, chemically cross&#8211;linked polymers capable of altering their physicochemical and mechanical properties on demand, upon application of external stimuli (e.g., light, temperature), are highly desirable for the development of multifunctional materials. Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo&#8211;reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross&#8211;link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid&#8211;catalyzed step&#8211;growth reaction of a difunctional PEG&#8211;thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross&#8208;linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross&#8722;links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation, endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV (&#955; = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm&#8211;1) and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating, were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1H NMR spectroscopy kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Tetrahedral and Cation Entropies for Long&#8208;lifespan Low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, their&#160;application&#160;is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low&#8208;temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with&#160;the desolvation&#160;kinetics&#160;of&#160;Zn2+. We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3&#8208;butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable&#160;glass&#8208;forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid&#8208;liquid transition temperature from &#8208;16.4 to &#8208;101 &#176;C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn&#178;&#8314;&#160;to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by&#8208;reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long&#8208;term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at &#8208;40 &#176;C&#160;under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8208;2,&#160;and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (&#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C). This work offers a guideline to design stable&#160;and low&#8208;temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope&#160;for aqueous electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole&#8208;linked COFs (TABQ&#8208;COF and TAPT&#8208;COF) via one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho&#8208;diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity, but also exhibit excellent physico&#8208;chemical stability and contain abundant redox&#8208;active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox&#8208;active centers (C=O and C=N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multi&#8208;electron redox mechanisms. This study highlights the strategic advantage of structurally stable COFs with precisely engineered redox&#8208;active motifs via facile synthesis for advancing high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole-linked COFs (TABQ-COF and TAPT-COF) via one-pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho-diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity, but also exhibit excellent physico-chemical stability and contain abundant redox-active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT-COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&amp;lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox-active centers (C=O and C=N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multi-electron redox mechanisms.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Metallic Binding Characteristics of the Intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;Block Cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8211;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#8211;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8208;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Structure&#8208;Selective On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Isokekulene versus Kekulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of different facets of metal nanoparticles in steering reaction pathways is crucial for the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior selectivity. As a prominent class of reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8208;H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92 %, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (&gt; 99 %). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO&#8208;functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule&#8208;substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly&#8208;selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters&#160;by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for&#160;enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge.&#160;In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy&#160;which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering.&#160;Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (~1 nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters,&#160;including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo, and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale&#160;IrCo alloy clusters&#160;(denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster)&#160;demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; and a remarkable mass activity 87.5&#160;times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between&#160;Ir atoms and the support,&#160;which inhibits particle agglomeration. This&#160;work provides an&#160;effective strategy for&#160;preventing&#160;particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves&#160;precise size control&#160;at sub&#8208;nanoscale,&#160;opening&#160;a new avenue for the development&#160;of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theorical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT&#160;enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT&#8208;modified n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial&#8208;related issues for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Assisted Confined Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Metal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of enzymatic and metal catalysis in cascade reactions offers a highly efficient approach for producing high&#8208;value chemicals, such as chiral pharmaceuticals. However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme&#8208;assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions.&#160;The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co&#8208;encapsulation and dual&#8208;optimization of both components.&#160;Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2&#8208;fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1&#8208;phenylethylamine (1&#8208;PEA), and a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in racemization&#160;conversion,&#160;compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers&#160;~91% yield, &gt;98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal&#8208;enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme&#8208;metal cascade systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical performances of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of phase structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. In this study, a series of P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P'2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn&#8208;valence changes during synthesis process, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P'2&#8208;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these structural insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the obtained P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ~40 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ~93 mAh g&#8208;1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%. This research significantly advances the comprehension of both synthesis mechanism and electrochemical properties optimization mechanisms of P'2 phase materials, offering a pragmatic strategy for elevating the performance of SIB materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post&#8208;hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer of Ag(II) CF2X Carboxylates: Quantum Yield and Electrophotocatalytic Arene Fluoroalkylation Tuned by X</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of CF2X groups beyond CF3 into arene scaffolds is underdeveloped despite these groups&#8217; utility as halogen&#8208;bond donors and as precursors to bioisosteres. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and comparative photochemistry of a suite of [Ag(II)(bpy)2O2CCF2X]+ and Ag(II)(bpy)(O2CCF2X)2 (bpy = 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, X = F, CF3, Cl, Br, H, CH3) carboxylate complexes. We find a dramatic effect of the X substituent on the efficiency of generating CF2X radicals by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), with Ag(II) photoreduction rates varying by over an order of magnitude and quantum yields spanning over 20%. We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)&#8211;O2CCF2X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)&#8208;mediated electrophotocatalytic CF2X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes. This work expands the nascent field of Ag(II)&#8208;based photocatalysis by allowing for (hetero)aryl&#8211;CF2X functionalization directly from unactivated fluoroalkyl carboxylate precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>PCR&#8208;Free Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis on Repetitive Sequences Using Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Assisted Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Nicking by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (SDM) is a key driver for many biochemical investigations and biotechnological applications. Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR&#8208;free SDM method that uses DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double&#8208;stranded DNA, we employed single&#8208;stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double&#8208;stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target&#8208;specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR&#8208;incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost&#8208;effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Protected Organozirconium Catalyzes C&#8211;H Alumination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface grafted organozirconium&#8208;catalyzes C&#8211;H/Et&#8211;Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt3, to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(OtBu)3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;700 (1) catalyst contains monopodal &#8801;SiO&#8211;Zr(OtBu)3 and only a few residual silanols (&lt;5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille&#8217;s heel of 1, providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si&#8211;O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with &#8211;SiMe3. Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid&#8208;state 13C and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(OtBu)3/SiMe3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;700 (2), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt3. CH alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1&#8208;dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1, and in &gt;95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H alumination, providing a route to AlMe3.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type Photophysics of Rotational Isomers in a Diphenylanthracene Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecular dimers serve as valuable model systems for manipulating and exploring interchromophore interactions. However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9,10,10&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bianthracene (TPBA) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA. To address the &#8216;Janus&#8208;type&#8217; photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment&#8208;dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in&#8208;depth study of the Janus&#8208;like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (  Ni@COF1  ) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (  Ni@COF1R  ),  Ni@COF1  exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late&#8208;stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin&#8208;linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of Alkyl gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Construct Carbon and Silicon Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increased encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) compared to TRAP and demonstrates improved uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is injected into mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and fit to a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model. NIR&#8208;TMPA demonstrates prolonged short&#8208;phase half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control with similar slow&#8208;phase half&#8208;life, leading to an increased area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve clearance and pointing to its sequestration in the tumor site. Endpoint fluorescence analysis of mouse organs ex vivo also supports this conclusion. TMPA and its future derivatives therefore bear potential for targeted treatment of GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co,Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co,Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6+2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2+6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the investigation of inorganic reagents containing the pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) moiety is presented. First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#8208;N=S(O)F2) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM led to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Inositol Pyrophosphate Toolbox: Stereoselective Synthesis and Application of PP&#8208;InsP4 Isomers in Plant Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS&#8217;s ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe TL&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated the XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1,874 FDA&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with Cys342 of XPB, suppressed XPB&#8217;s ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 into Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. We developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at &#8722;1.8 V vs. RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20 hours without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4 V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5 mmol L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: (i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and (ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline&#160;2D&#160;Conjugated&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic&#160;Framework&#160;for Superior Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, polymer&#8208;containing Cage&#8208;POPs and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclisation&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals; especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the effort to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including (TD&#8208;)DFT and ADC(2) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead shows that photoswitching proceeds on the T&#8321; PES. These insights enhance our understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference from oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;&#8208;systems. This &#960;&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#8211;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from&#160;gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of&#160;tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropane diboronates in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Performance of Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zinc Ion Batteries via Zincophilic Solubilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in tackling severe issues facing aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, to satisfy the quest of flexible and eco&#8208;friendly batteries, developing low&#8208;cost and high mechanical durability hydrogel electrolyte remains a challenge. Here, employing the zincophilic solubilizer urea, we break the classical concentration limits of the low&#8208;cost Zn(Ac)2 salt and introduce it into the hydrogel skeleton. The &#8220;salting out&#8221; effect give the polymer chain sediments a tighter bundle and twist effect. The as&#8208;formed hydrogel electrolyte can endure 557% high elongation and 3.7 MPa compressive strength to resist repeated zinc plating/striping process and external physical stimuli. The in&#8208;situ polyurea solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer leads to thermodynamically stable anode/electrolyte interface. Utilizing the hydrogel electrolyte, the zinc anode shows high reversibility, leading to an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.93% for 150 cycles on the Zn//Cu battery. When assembled with NH4V4O10 cathode (NVO), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 253.8 mAh g&#8208;1 beyond 1000 cycles longevity at 1 A g&#8208;1. The pouch battery also shows a high capacity of 280.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1 and operate steadily for 90.13% retention after 200 cycles, and maintained a stable voltage even experienced bending and folding.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n &lt; 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals, (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates.&#160;Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm.&#160; Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO&#160;at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Mechanostable Anticalin Scaffolds to Enhance Particle Adhesion and Targeting of CTLA&#8208;4 under Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e. anchor point) within a non&#8208;antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA&#8208;4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio&#8208;orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single&#8208;molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead&#8208;based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA&#8208;4) complex. Multi&#8208;regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA&#8208;4&#8217;s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA&#8208;4 targets and provides a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroboration of Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well&#8208;established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom&#8208;substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac)2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;hydroboration products in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99%). Mechanistic studies including deuterium&#8208;labeling, kinetic, and UV&#8208;Vis experiments suggest the involvement of Co&#8211;H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late&#8208;stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Active Sites in Coordination Polymers Enable Ampere&#8208;level Acetylene Semihydrogenation in Membrane Electrode Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation in membrane electrode assembly systems promises a sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet faces challenges in catalyst performance and durability. Herein, we developed a Cu coordination polymer with hybrid sites that synergistically integrate open Cu sites and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These hybrid sites bestow the coordination polymer with acetylene gasophilicity, hydrophobicity toward water, and readily accessible active Cu sites, which energetically facilitate acetylene absorption and vinyl intermediate formation, thereby enabling efficient ethylene production at ampere&#8208;level current densities. In a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with pure acetylene, this polymeric catalyst achieved high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 93.1% at &#8208;0.5 A/cm2 and 83.3% at &#8208;1.0 A/cm2, with stable operation for 100 h at &#8208;0.5 A/cm2. Notably, even with a 15% coal&#8208;derived acetylene at a flow rate of 60 standard cubic centimetres per minute, this catalyst system demonstrated 64.4% ethylene energy efficiency and durable performance over 200 h at &#8208;0.5 A. This work advances the design of highly stable and active polymeric catalysts for electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl Spillover Activated from the Strongly Coupled Ru@Mn3O4 Heterostructure to Promote Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH* desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH* desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn3O4, in which Ru clusters&#160;are decorated on Mn3O4 via Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn3O4 facilitates the water dissociation, while the formed hetero&#8208;interface can efficiently desorb OH* via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn3O4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8211;1, surpassing recently reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn3O4 increase about 11 and 8&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect, and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.</dc:description>

By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Digital&#8208;Twin&#8208;Assisted Insights into Irreversible Capacity and Activation Strategy Power High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs), the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current&#8208;collector as that in the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando transport of charge &amp; mass. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on assumed or simplified models. Herein, we build digital&#8208;twin electrodes with digital&#8208;space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital&#8208;model&#8208;driven simulation, we find an interesting &#8220;lithium trapping&#8221; effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes but not near current&#8208;collector region. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>
