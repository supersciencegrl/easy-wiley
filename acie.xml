         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analyzed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru atoms causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganization can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalization of surfaces with carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>An&#160;Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it&#8217;s still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;  jk  ]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26% peaks @ 388 nm and 4.02 % peaks @ 406 nm with small FWHM of 32 nm and 46 nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100 cd m  &#8208;2  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A sequential phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of aldimines with allenoates and oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer strategy has been developed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a range of axially chiral CF3&#8208;containing 2&#8208;arylpyrroles with high enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, an atroposelective synthesis of esaxerenone is presented, illustrating the practical potential of the reported method.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Hydrogen Production Coupled with Electrochemical Oxidation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value&#8208;added products has gained enormous interest in recent years due to the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco&#8208;friendly. Moreover, small molecule oxidation reactions can serve as promising substitutes to replace the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, such as hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Coupling electrochemical oxidation of small molecules at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyser would simultaneously realize high value chemicals generation or pollutant degradation and high&#8208;efficient hydrogen production. In recent years, various thermodynamically more favorable small molecules oxidation reactions have been designed as promising alternatives to OER to achieve highly efficient hydrogen production. In this Minireview, we present a brief introduction about small molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we highlight the discussion about recent breakthroughs in small molecule oxidation assisted highly efficient hydrogen production, including alternative molecules, modulated strategies of catalysts, and related catalytic reaction mechanisms in small molecule oxidation reactions. Finally, a perspective on possible challenges and future orientations of small molecule oxidation is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrically substituted 10H,10'H&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobi[acridine] derivatives as hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) based on the 10  H  , 10'H&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobi [acridine] core (  BSA50  and  BSA51  ) were synthesized, and their electronic and hole transportation properties were explored. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the presence of rigid 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in  BSA 50  brings about improved hole mobility, and higher work function (lower HOMO level) compared to bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine units in  BSA51  , which increase interfacial hole transportation from the perovskite to the HTM. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on  BSA50  exhibit higher  V  oc  and FF than those with  BSA51  , boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.65%, which is close to the value obtained in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based devices (23.37%). Owing to the higher hydrophobicity of  BSA50  and its effective defect passivation, unencapsulated PSCs exhibit superior stability to devices employing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, retaining nearly 90% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h operation output. A perovskite solar module using  BSA50  HTM exhibits a PCE of 21.35% (6.5 &#215; 7 cm) with a  J  sc  of 3.08 mA cm  &#8208;2  ,  V  oc  of 8.761 V and FF of 79.1%. This work demonstrates the high potential of molecularly engineered spirobi[acridine] derivatives as HTMs as replacements of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interaction on Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the simultaneous presence of two metal active centres, some special interactions occur between active sites in diatomic catalysts (DACs). Such interactions play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of the reaction, denoted as long&#8208;range interaction (LRI). The right combination must be screened and clarified to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, the LRI has not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism and electrocatalytic applications of LRI are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRI on DACs are proposed to present an overall view and reference for future research.</dc:description>

In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRI on DACs are proposed to present an overall view and reference for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical&#160;S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32,220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161,954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli.&#160;US irradiation induces the valence conversion from Cu(II) to Cu(I) catalyzing H2O2 into &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Stable Anion&#8208;Tuned Electrode/Electrolyte Interphase on High&#8208;Voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Cathode for Thermally&#8208;Modulated Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable electrode/electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics is vital for fast&#8208;charging batteries. Herein, we investigate the interphase that forms between a high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and the electrolytes consisting of 3.0, 1.0, or 0.3 M NaClO4 in an organic carbonate solvent (47.5:47.5:5 mixture of EC: PC: FEC) during charging up to 4.5 V at 55oC. It is found that a higher anion/solvent ratio in electrolyte solvation structure induces anion&#8208;dominated interphase containing more inorganic species and more anion derivatives (CxClOy), which leads to a larger interfacial Na+ transport resistance and more unfavorable gas evolution. In comparison, a low anion/solvent ratio derives stable anion&#8208;tuned interphase that enables better interfacial kinetics and cycle ability. Importantly, the performance of a failed cathode is restored by triggering the decomposition of CxClOy species. This work elucidates the role of tuning interphase in fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Iodine Uptake by a Molecular Host&#8226;Guest Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>recently, porous organic crystals (POC) based on macrocycles have shown exceptional sorption and separation properties. Yet, the impact of guest presence inside a macrocycle prior to adsorption has not been studied. Here we show that the inclusion of trimethoxybenzyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane in the macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) affords molecular Porous Host&#8226;Guest Crystals (PHGC&#8208;1) featured by radically new properties. Unactivated hydrated PHGC&#8208;1 adsorbed iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of (i) heat for material synthesis, (ii) moisture sensitivity and (iii) energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are attractive attributes for decrease of energetic costs. 1H NMR and DOSY were instrumental to monitor the H2O/I2 exchange. Finally, PHGC&#8208;1 are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and I2 doped crystals showed markedly different Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) suggesting that iodine doping could be used to modulate the non&#8208;linear optical properties of porous organic crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Darwin&#8217;s warm pond rich with nutrients, lesser number of early catalytic machineries with modest capabilities were able to demonstrate promiscuity by catalyzing diverse biochemical transformations important for protometabolism. Herein, we report catalytically promiscuous amyloid&#8208;based short peptide assemblies that could concomitantly catalyse three metabolically important yet orthogonal reactions. The surface exposed catalytic dyads featuring lysines and imidazoles were utilized for C=N condensation via dynamic covalent linkages and modulation of protonation events, respectively. Further, the peptide assemblies could promiscuously catalyse hydrolysis as well as retro&#8208;aldol reactions, that could be co&#8208;opted to facilitate C=N bond formation, either by a feedforward&#8208;driven reaction network or by replenishing depleted substrates. The catalytic diversity of short peptide based promiscuous &#946;&#8208;sheet folds suggests their possible role in promoting the protometabolic network in early earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymers need to start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2  emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers need to be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This review explores how scientific advances, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Orange&#8208;Red Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent CsCdCl3:Mn2+ Perovskite Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide perovskite has been widely studied as a new generation of photoelectronic materials. However, their thermal and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a hexagonal Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite crystal that possesses stable photoluminescence (PL) at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of the single crystals lasts up to 1480 s and can be adjusted by changing the concentration of Mn2+ ion doping. The characteristic emission of d&#8208;d transition of Mn2+ is realized, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 91.4%, it can maintain more than 90% of the initial PL spectral integral area at 150 &#176;C (423 K). High humid stability PL can be achieved more than 75% of the initial PL intensity after 55 days of immersion in water. These excellent properties show the application prospect of the LPL material in lighting indication and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation, Total Synthesis, Antibacterial In Vivo Efficacy and Biosynthesis Proposal of Myxobacterial Corramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the myxobacterial natural product Corramycin isolated from Corallococcus coralloides. The linear peptide structure contains an unprecedented (2R,3S)&#8209;&#947;&#8209;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8209;histidine moiety. Corramycin exhibits anti&#8208;Gram&#8208;negative activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and is taken up via two transporter systems, SbmA and YejABEF. Furthermore, the Corramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and a biosynthesis model was proposed involving a 12&#8208;modular non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase. Bioinformatic analysis of the BGC combined with the development of a total synthesis route allowed for the elucidation of the molecule&#8217;s absolute configuration. Importantly, intravenous administration of 30&#160;mg kg&#8209;1 of Corramycin in an E. coli mouse infection model resulted in 60 % survival of animals without toxic side effects. Corramycin is thus a promising starting point to develop a potent antibacterial drug against hospital&#8209;acquired infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8208;Air Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O2 and CO2 reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round&#8208;trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue. Considering the rapid development and emerging issues of this field, this review aims to timely summarize the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;air batteries in terms of configurations and mechanisms, provides the general design strategies and specific examples of photocathodes, systematically discuss the influences of light on the battery, and finally provide existing gaps and future priorities towards practical light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Elucidation and Structural Revision of Brevione E: Characterization of the Key Dioxygenase for Pathway Branching from Setosusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brevione E (1) is a fungal hexacyclic meroditerpenoid with unique oxepane and cycloheptenone moieties. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of&#160;1&#160;and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Surprisingly, reexamination of the structure of&#160;1&#160;revealed a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring instead of the previously proposed oxepane system. Moreover, we determined that cycloheptenone synthesis involves skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is highly homologous to SetK, which engages in the biosynthesis of another fungal metabolite, setosusin, and accepts the same substrate as BrvJ but performs only simple hydroxylation. Finally, we identified the key amino acid residues critical for product selectivity of BrvJ and SetK, providing insight into how the biosynthesis pathways of&#160;1&#160;and setosusin diverge and how fungi diversify natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3 V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000 times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of thioflavin&#8208;T to monitor fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual microscopic rate constants which are associated with fibril assembly. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Expansion of the Catalytic Repertoire of Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise a highly conserved enzyme family that catalyse the reversible reduction of aldehydes. However, recent discoveries in plant natural product biosynthesis suggest that the catalytic repertoire of ADHs has been expanded. Here we report the crystal structure of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase (DPAS), an ADH that catalyses the non&#8208;canonical 1,4&#8208;reduction of an &#945;,&#946; &#8208;unsaturated iminium moiety. Comparison with structures of plant&#8208;derived ADHs suggest the 1,4&#8208;iminium reduction does not require a proton relay or the presence of a catalytic zinc ion in contrast to canonical 1,2&#8208;aldehyde reducing ADHs that require the catalytic zinc and a proton relay. Furthermore, ADHs that catalysed 1,2&#8208;iminium reduction required the presence of the catalytic zinc and the loss of the proton relay. This suggests how the ADH active site can be modified to perform atypical carbonyl reductions, providing insight into how chemical reactions are diversified in plant metabolism.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acids: A Multifunctional Monooxygenase Delivers a Complex and Highly Branched Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nodulisporic acids (NAs) are structurally complex potent antiinsectan indole diterpenes. We previously reported the biosynthetic gene cluster for these metabolites in Hypoxylon pulicicidum and functionally characterised the first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Here we reveal a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple end products through expression of cluster components in Penicillium paxilli. We show that seven additional cluster&#8208;encoded gene products comprise the biosynthetic machinery that elaborate precursor NAF in this highly branched pathway. The combined action of these enzymes delivers 37 NA congeners including four major end products, NAA, NAA1, NAA2 and NAA4. The plethora of intermediates arises due to modification of the carboxylated prenyl tail by a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme which produces four distinct biosynthetic products giving rise to the complex metabolic grid that characterises NA biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+  hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8211;  and benzene ([WCA]&#8211;  = [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8211;; RF  = C(CF3)3). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically  &#951;3,  &#951;6&#8208;slipped sandwich structure.

         <title>Genome Mining Enabled by Biosynthetic Characterization Uncovers a Class of Benzoxazolinate&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Diverse Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C&#8208;1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Here, we show a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We then use the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discover that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that&#160;Pseudomonas&#160;chlororaphis&#160;produces various benzobactins, whose&#160;biosyntheses arehighlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production;&#160;the formation of non&#8208;proteinogenic 2&#8208;hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and&#160;the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Activation of Molecular Oxygen and Surface Lattice Oxygen in Single Atom Cu1/TiO2 Catalyst for CO O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth mechanism on the simultaneous activation of O  2&#160;  and surface lattice O  2&#8208;&#160;  on one active metallic site has not been elucidated yet. Herein, we report a strategy for the construction of abundant oxygen activation sites by rational design of Cu  1  /TiO  2&#160;  single atom catalysts (SACs). The charge transfer between isolated Cu and TiO  2&#160;  support generates abundant Cu(I) and 2&#8208;coordinated O  lat  &#160;sites in Cu  1  &#8208;O&#8208;Ti hybridization structure, which facilitates the chemisorption and activation of O  2  molecules. Simultaneously, the Cu  1  &#8208;O&#8208;Ti induced TiO  2  &#160;lattice distortion activate the adjacent surface lattice O  2&#8208;  , achieving the dual activation of O  2  &#160;and surface lattice O  2&#8208;  &#160;The Cu  1  &#8208;O&#8208;Ti active site switches the CO oxidation mechanism from Eley&#8208;Rideal (80 &#176;C) to Mars&#8208;van Krevelen route (200 &#176;C) with the increase of reaction temperature. The dual activation of O  2  &#160;and surface lattice O  2&#8208;  &#160;can by modulating the electron properties of SACs can boost the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation activity.</dc:description>

The charge transfer between isolated Cu and TiO  2&#160;  support generates abundant Cu(I) and 2-coordinated O  lat  &#160;sites in Cu  1  -O-Ti hybridization structure, which facilitates the chemisorption and activation of O  2  molecules. Simultaneously, the Cu  1  -O-Ti induced TiO  2  &#160;lattice distortion activate the adjacent surface lattice O  2-  , achieving the dual activation of O  2  &#160;and surface lattice O  2-  &#160;The Cu  1  -O-Ti active site switches the CO oxidation mechanism from Eley-Rideal (80 &#176;C) to Mars-van Krevelen route (200 &#176;C) with the increase of reaction temperature. The dual activation of O  2  &#160;and surface lattice O  2-  &#160;can by modulating the electron properties of SACs can boost the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Enantioselective Ullmann Coupling of ortho&#8208;Chlorinated Aryl Aldehydes Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#697;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine ligand (+)&#8208;DTB&#8208;SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short&#8208;step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)&#8208;kotanin, (&#8208;)&#8208;isoschizandrin and (+)&#8208;gossypol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is&#160;a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand.&#160;Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx&#160;MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading.&#160;HOF is self&#8208;assembled by&#160;organic monomers&#160;through hydrogen bonding interactions&#160;between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities&#160;in HOF&#160;structure, which can encapsulate iodine&#160;through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can&#160;accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries.&#160;The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx&#160;exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.2 C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2&#160;and Na&#8208;I2&#160;batteries, respectively.&#160;This work can&#160;gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine&#160;encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hewettite ZnV6O16&#183;8H2O with Remarkably Stable Layers and Ultralarge Interlayer Spacing for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their intrinsic safety, low&#8208;cost and high energy&#8208;intensity. Vanadium&#8208;based materials are widely used as the cathode of ZIBs, especially A2V6O16&#183;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K). However, AVO suffers from serious dissolution, phase transformation and narrow gallery spacing (~3 &#197;), leading to poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we unveil the root cause of the performance degradation in the AVO cathode and therefore developed a new high&#8208;performance cathode of ZnV6O16&#183;8H2O (ZVO) for ZIB. Through a method of ion exchange induced phase transformation, AVO was converted to hewettite ZVO with larger gallery spacing (~6 &#197;) and more stable V6O16 layers. ZVO cathode thus constructed delivers a high capacity of 365 and 170 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.3 and 15 A g&#8208;1, while 86% and 70% of its capacity are retained at 0.3 A g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles and at 15 A g&#8208;1 after 10000 cycles, substantially better than conventional AVO.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversi&#64257;cation of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular  ortho  C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;  tert  &#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

Herein we design a synthetic polymer&#8208;based secondary structure analogue of Zinc finger (ZnF) by introducing a zinc coordination motif to overcome the free energy barrier predicted by theoretical calculations and fold free polymer chains. The conformational switching between unfolded and folded state of the ZnF analogue can be in situ triggered to drastically manipulate the accessibility of conjugated cell adhesive ligands to the cell membrane receptors, thereby effectively controlling the adhesion, spreading, mechanosensing, and differentiation of stem cells. We believe that emulating the dynamic secondary structures of proteins via rational design of folded synthetic polymer&#8211;cation complex is a promising strategy for developing bioactive materials to mediate desired cellular functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Thianthrenium Salts with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxyl group is one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Herein, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) at room temperature has been developed. The reaction employs low loading of cuprous chloride catalyst under 1 atm CO  2  and exhibits good functional group tolerance. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, this work provides an efficient method for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It may serve as a significant late&#8208;stage carboxylation tool for the modification of drug molecules in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Removal and Degradation of Microplastics Using the Magnetic and Nanozyme Activities of Bare Iron Oxide Nanoaggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal and degradation of microplastics are often carried out separately. In this work, hydrophilic bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates allowed efficient removal of the most common microplastics including high&#8208;density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Full extraction was achieved using Fe3O4 at 1% of the mass of microplastics. Hydrogen bonding is the main force for the adsorption of Fe3O4. Unlike the more commonly used hydrophobically modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the bare Fe3O4 benefitted from the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of its exposed surface, enabling further catalytic degradation of microplastics with nearly 100% efficiency and easy recovery of the Fe3O4.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;&#8208;Gold Alloy Catalyzes the Aerobic Oxidation of Formic Acid for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide production through electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions has recently attracted broad research interest. However, practical applications have thus far been plagued by the low activity and the requirement of complex equipment. Here, inspired by the process of biological hydrogen peroxide synthesis catalyzed by enzymes, we report a Pt&#8208;Au alloy to mimic the catalytic function of natural formate oxidase for hydrogen peroxide synthesis through aerobic oxidation of formic acid. The mass activity of the Pt&#8208;Au alloy is three times higher than that of formate oxidase. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the efficient dehydrogenation of formic acid and the high selectivity of the subsequent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide account for the high hydrogen peroxide productivity. In addition, the formic acid aqueous solution provides an acidic environment, which is conducive to the utilization of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide for oxidation reactions, including C&#8208;H bond oxidation and sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing All&#8208;climate Li&#8210;S Batteries via Sub&#8208;nano Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8210;S) batteries with high energy density are currently receiving enormous attention. However, their redox kinetics at low temperature is extremely tardy, and polysulfides shuttling is serious at high temperature, which severely hinders the implementation of wide&#8208;temperature Li&#8210;S batteries. Herein, we propose an all&#8208;climate Li&#8210;S battery based on an ether&#8208;based electrolyte by using a porous sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) modified separator. It&#8217;s demonstrated that the fully conjugated SAF&#8208;3 with a small pore size (0.97 nm) and narrow bandgap (1.72 eV) could efficiently block the polysulfides shuttling at elevated temperature and boost the polysulfides conversion at low temperature. Consequently, the SAF&#8208;3 modified&#160;cells work well in a wide temperature ranging from &#8210;40 to 60 &#176;C.&#160;Furthermore, when operated at room temperature, the modified cell exhibits 90% capacity retention over 100 cycles under high&#8208;sulfur loading (5.0 mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5 mL mg&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Local Proton Source Enhanced Nitrogen Reduction on a Combined Cobalt&#8208;Molybdenum Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted considerable scientific and engineering interest as a green alternative route for NH3 production. Molybdenum is a promising candidate as an electrocatalyst for NRR as it has a suitable binding strength with N species. However, the design of an efficient Mo&#8208;based catalyst remains elusive. To enhance the selectivity of NRR toward NH3, we have developed a carbon nanofiber catalyst embedded with molybdenum and cobalt (Co&#8208;Mo&#8208;CNF). Co with a strong ability to dissociate water enhances local proton source near Mo, where the hydrogenation step of the NRR occurs. A NH3 formation rate of 72.72 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 34.5% were obtained at &#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE. We also attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the NRR via in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotopic labeling experiments using 15N2 and D2O.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes with photoactive chargetransfer excited states are pervasive throughout literature.

Meanwhile, interest in luminescence and reactivity of so&#8208;called spin&#8208;flip metal&#8208;centered states has risen dramatically after the  Molecular Ruby  [Cr(ddpd)  2  ]  3+  (ddpd =  N  ,  N  &#8217;dimethyl&#8208;  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) unveiled design principles to access strong, long&#8208;lived emission from photostable chromium(III) complexes. This review contrasts the properties of emissive charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states illustrated with the prototypical complexes [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  and [Cr(ddpd)  2  ]  3+  . First, we discuss the nature of the relevant excited states, their tunability with regards to energy and lifetime, and their responses to external stimuli. The final section identifies strengths and weaknesses of the charge transfer and spin&#8208;flip states in applications such as photoredox catalysis, sensing and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).</dc:description>

         <title>The Elusive Mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] Cluster in Three Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8211;sulfur clusters are well&#8208;established targets in biological nitric oxide (NO) chemistry, but the key intermediate in these processes&#8212;a mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] cluster&#8212;has not been fully characterized in a protein or a synthetic model thereof. Here, we report the synthesis of a three&#8208;member redox series of isostructural mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters.&#160;Mononitrosylation was achieved by binding NO to a 3:1 site&#8208;differentiated [Fe4S4]+&#160;cluster; subsequent oxidation and reduction afforded the other members of the series. All three clusters feature a local high&#8208;spin Fe3+&#160;center antiferromagnetically coupled to&#160;3[NO]&#8211;.&#160;The observation of an anionic NO ligand suggests that NO binding is accompanied by formal electron transfer from the cluster to NO. Preliminary reactivity studies with the monocationic cluster demonstrate that exposure to excess NO degrades the cluster, supporting the intermediacy of mononitrosylated intermediates in NO sensing/signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln = Sm, Dy, Yb): A Mixed&#8208;Ligand Pathway to New Lanthanide (III) Multifunctional Materials Featuring Nonlinear Optical and Magnetic Anisotropy Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized metal&#8208;ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin&#8208;based technologies, but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln3+ materials Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln = Sm, Dy, Yb) by mixed&#8208;ligand design. The materials exhibit phase&#8208;matching nonlinear optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with multiple functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Exposed Facets of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;rate Alkaline Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn growing attention as promising electrode candidates for rechargeable batteries. However, most studies focus on the direct use of MOF electrodes without any modification. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, a judicious tool to modify targeted properties of MOFs, has been long&#8208;neglected in the field of batteries. Herein, crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed to design MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high capacity and fast electrochemical kinetics. We found that a thermally&#8208;modified strategy can regulate the dominant exposed facet of Ni&#8208;based MOF (PFC&#8208;8). With the optimally exposed facets, the battery exhibited admirable rate capability (139.4 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 2.5 A g  &#8208;1  and 110.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 30 A g  &#8208;1  ) and long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that stronger OH  &#8208;  adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures induced by the regulated exposed facets boost the electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe the rapid synthesis of tetracyclic metallaaromatics containing quinoline and pentalene motifs fused by a metal&#8208;bridged fragment. These unique compounds display remarkably broad absorption, enabling for the first time the absorption of metallaaromatics to reach the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) biowindow. The formation of osmaquinoline unit involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling promoted by AgBF4 to achieve [3+3] cycloaddition.

         <dc:description>The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via Pt(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt(II) and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Double&#8208;Layer Capacitor based on Carbon@ Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High energy demand results in comprehensive research of novel materials for energy sources and storage applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess appropriate features such as long&#8208;range order, permanent porosity, tunable pore size, and ion diffusion pathways to be competitive electrode materials. Herein, we present a deep electrochemical study of two COF&#8208;aerogels shaped into flexible COF&#8208;electrodes (ECOFs) by a simple compression method to fabricate an electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC). This energy storage system has considerable interest owing to its high&#8208;power density and long cycle life compared with batteries. Our result confirmed the outstanding behavior of ECOFs as EDLC devices with a capacity retention of almost 100% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles and, to our knowledge, the highest areal capacitance (9.55 mF cm&#8208;2) in aqueous electrolytes at higher scan rates (1000 mV s&#8208;1) for COFs. More importantly, the hierarchical porosity observed in the ECOFs increases ion transport, which permits a fast interface polarization (low &#964;0 values). The complete sheds light on using ECOFs as novel electrode material to fabricate EDLC devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Nanoradiosensitizers Enhance Radiotherapy by Combining ROS Generation and CO Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lack of targeting accuracy and radiosensitivity severely limit clinical radiotherapy. In this study, we developed Ru&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanostructures (MONs) radiosensitizer (ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem) to optimize irradiation by maximizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and CO release in X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced dynamic therapy (XDT). The well&#8208;designed nanostructures increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). Intriguingly, the secondary electrons were trapped and transferred in this constrained MONs and induce a cascade of reactions to increase the therapeutic efficiency. Meanwhile, the full&#8208;length antiglypican 3 (GPC3) antibody (hGC33) expressed cell membrane coating enabled actively tumor sites targeting with optimized biocompatibility. These results indicate that the ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem represent a starting point for advancing an all&#8208;around radiosensitizer to potentiate clinical XDT efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Oxygenation: Catalytic Enantioselective Formation of Five&#8208;Membered Cyclic Organic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of non&#8208;racemic 5&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohols is reported. Conversion of the alcohol into an azanyl carbonate is followed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed cyclization to provide chiral cyclic carbonates in yields of up to 95% and with up to 99% ee. This new synthetic method is proposed to proceed through a nitrene&#8208;mediated intramolecular C(sp  3  )&#8722;H oxygenation which includes a very unusual 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer within a ruthenium nitrenoid intermediate. The method is applicable to the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic chiral mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted cyclic alkylene carbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe structural instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li  3  PO  4&#160;&#160;  is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM&#160;are investigated inside a working SSLB by  in situ  atomic force microscopy (AFM).&#160;We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on surface of pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM&#160;maintains the initial structure of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus endows the battery&#160;with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8208;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Square Planar Cobalt (II) complexes via Sodium Mediated Cobaltation of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While cobalt complexes have already shown their potential for C&#8211;H and C&#8211;F bond activation of fluoroarenes, their reactivity as metalating agents via Co&#8211;H exchange towards these substrates has not been explored. Herein, we report a Co(HMDS)  2  [HMDS = N(SiMe  3  )  2  ] system which, when synergistically enhanced via sodium amide Na(HMDS) mediation, can render chemo&#8208; and regioselective cobaltation of a series of fluoroarenes to produce a new class of homoleptic square planar [Na  2  CoAr  4  ] complexes. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the key roles of the Na/Co counterparts in a stepwise sodiation/cobalt transmetalation process, leading to this novel C&#8211;H metalation. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, this process can occur inter&#8208; or intramolecularly, furnishing transient [NaCo(HMDS)  2  Ar] intermediates which can undergo ligand rearrangement to afford [Na  2  CoAr  4  ] with concomitant formation of Co(HMDS)  2  and [NaCo(HMDS)  3  ].</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Lattice Expansion of FAPbBr3 to Design a 3D Hybrid Perovskite for Sensitive Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13  (1  , NMDAP2+  is N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diaminopropanium, FA+  is formamidinium) is tailored by incorporating coordinately large NMDAP2+  cation with small FA+  into 3D FAPbBr3  . Structurally, small FA+  occupy the prototypical cavities formed by distorted corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6  octahedra like in FAPbBr3  , while bulky NMDAP2+  cations are confined into the expanded lattices which is defined by a new structural motif composed of eight corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6  octahedra and four edge&#8208;sharing octahedra. This localized lattice expansion from FAPbBr3  creates a new branch of the intriguing 3D hybrid perovskite family, breaking the limits of conventional Goldschmidt tolerance factor rule. Moreover, a high two&#8208;photon absorption (2AP) coefficient of 60.8 cm MW&#8211;1  was demonstrated to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) 800nm illumination, enabling sensitive NIR photoresponse with large on/off ratio (~104  ) as well as favorable stability.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of di&#8208;branched alkanes from their isomers is vital in gasoline upgrading to achieve high octane numbers but is significantly challenging and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of hexane isomers by combing molecular recognition and size&#8208;sieving in a bismuth&#8208;based MOF, UU&#8208;200. The unique auxetic structure with reentrant honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows endows UU&#8208;200 with a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and high capacities for linear and mono&#8208;branched isomers. The molecular sieving effect, unprecedented separation selectivities, and excellent efficiencies are proved via adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments with high research octane numbers obtained (&gt;96), indicating a benchmark for alkane separation under ambient conditions. The molecular recognition mechanism was unveiled by theoretical simulation and in&#8208;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Additive with a Rigid Solvation Shell for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite substantial progresses, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), developing zinc metal anodes with long&#8208;term reliable cycling capabilities is nontrivial because of dendritic growth and related parasitic reactions on the zinc surface. Here, we exploit the tip&#8208;blocking effect of a scandium (Sc  3+  ) additive in the electrolyte to induce uniform zinc deposition. Additional to the tri&#8208;valency of Sc  3+  , the rigidity of its hydration shell effectively prevents zinc ions from concentrating at the surface tips, enabling highly stable cycling under challenging conditions. The shell rigidity, quantified by the rate constant of the exchange reaction (  k  ex  ), is established as a key descriptor for evaluating the tip&#8208;blocking effect of redox&#8208;inactive cations, explaining inconsistent results when only the valence state is considered. Moreover, the tip&#8208;blocking effect of Sc  3+  is maintained in blends with organic solvents, allowing the zinc anode to cycle reliably even at &#8722;40 &#176;C without corrosion.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryne 1,4&#8208;Disubstitution and Remote Diastereoselective 1,2,4&#8208;Trisubstitution via a Nucleophilic Annulation&#8722;[5,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangement Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. These transformations could directly incorporate a C&#8722;N and a C&#8722;C bond para to each other on an aryne intermediate via a sequential nucleophilic addition and [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. When arynes bearing 3&#8208;tethered electrophiles were employed, a cascade regioselective nucleophilic addition, intramolecular cyclization, and remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between two C&#8722;H hydrogens on the penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl chain and the oxygen anion generated upon N&#8208;nucleophilic annulation reaction in the [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement step is responsible for the remote diastereoselective control in this reaction system.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring LiCl in the Nanopores of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Ultra&#8208;High Uptake and Selective Separation of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia (NH3) is an important chemical raw material and a unique carbon&#8208;free fuel with high hydrogen energy density. Thus, NH3 capture, storage, and desorption are of significant importance. However, high capacity capture, low energy desorption, and selective separation of NH3 are still challengs so far. Here, we report high&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). It is found that the optimal composite shows a capture capacity of 33.9 mmol/g NH3at 1.0 bar and 25 &#176;C, which far exceeds the current record among the reported porous materials. Notably, the excellent capture capacity at low pressure and high temperature makes it possible to selectively capture NH3 from NH3/N2, NH3/CO2, and NH3/H2O. It is revealed that synergistic action of NH3 coordination to the highly dispersed Li+ in the MOF nanopores and hydrogen bonding of NH3 with Cl&#8208; account for such an excellent capture and selectivity performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally&#8208;suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this paper, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Copper Cathode for Nonaqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most reported cathodes of nonaqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) host anions via insertion reactions. It is necessary to explore new cathode chemistry to increase the battery energy density. To date, transition metals have yet to be investigated for nonaqueous DIBs, albeit they may offer high capacity in anodic conversion reactions. Here, we report that bulk copper powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of 762 mAh/g at 3.2 V vs. Li  +  /Li and relatively stable cycling in common organic electrolytes. The operation of the copper electrode is coupled with the transfer of anion charge carriers. An anion exchange membrane separator is employed to prevent Cu  2+  from crossing from the catholyte to the anode side. We designed an unbalanced electrolyte with a more concentrated anolyte than a catholyte. This addresses the concentration overpotential ensued during charge and facilitates the high specific capacity and enhanced reversibility. This finding provides a promising direction for high&#8208;energy DIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A deep learning framework for automated molecular recognitions in scanning probe microscopy images</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images and videos. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been routinely achieved thanks to the development of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) advancing our understanding on materials. However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on constant human supervision. In this work, we address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures with the computer version. We develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R&#8208;CNN, which can automatedly perform SPM image analysis with high efficiency and accuracy. To demonstrate its usefulness and high sensitivity in molecular recognition, we employ the framework to determine two triangular&#8208;shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label the positions of each molecule in STM images. We foresee that the application of computer vision in SPM images will become an indispensable part in the field, accelerating data mining and the discovery of new materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the construction of an organic crystal multiplexer using three chemically and optically different acicular, flexible organic crystals for a broadband, visible light signal transportation. The mechanical integration of a highly flexible crystal waveguide of (  Z  )&#8208;2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;methoxybenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylonitrile (BTD2CF  3  ) displaying bright yellow (&#955;  1  ) fluorescence with blue&#8208;emitting (&#955;  2  ) BPP and cyan emitting (&#955;  3  ) DBA crystals using AFM&#8208;tip provides a composite organic crystal multiplexer. The constructed hybrid single crystal multiplexer effectively transduces three optical signals (&#955;  1  +&#955;  2  +&#955;  3  ) covering the 420&#8208;750 nm region as a composite output signal. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiment demonstrates the real potential of organic flexible crystal waveguides for visible light communication technologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation of aryl vinyl carbinols under light irradiation is described. 2Methylbenzophenone derivatives are employed and activated to hydroxy&#8208;  o  &#8208;quinodimethanes by an ultraviolet (UV) light. This approach enables asymmetric allylic benzylation with high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) from readily available 2methylbenzophenones without the utilization of strong bases, and preactivation or pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrates. Moreover, deuterium experiments reveal the generation of nucleophilic benzyl species from 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone under UV irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Azaarenes and Alkynes via Photoredox Cobalt Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light&#8208;induced Co&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed. Notably, H&#252;nig&#8217;s base together with simple ethanol has been successfully applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this catalytic photoredox reaction. This approach has considerable advantages for the straightforward synthesis of stereodefined multiple substituted alkenes bearing an azaarene motif, such as excellent regioselectivity (&gt;20:1 for &gt;30 examples) and stereoselectivity (&gt;20:1  E  /  Z  ), broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility under mild reaction conditions, which has been utilized in the concise synthesis of natural product monomorine I. A reasonable catalytic reaction pathway involving protolysis of the cobaltacyclopentene intermediate has been proposed based on the mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of CuMn Prussian Blue Analog Double&#8208;shelled Nanoboxes Toward Long&#8208;life Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to their unique open&#8208;framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions of Mn&#8208;N  6  octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn  2+  ion insertion/extraction processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Based Organic Crystals with Distinct Conformers Enabling Wide&#8208;Range Excitation&#8208;Dependent Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and generalizable molecular platform that exhibits three emission bands in the crystalline states. The emission maximum can be tuned over a wide range (&#8819;230&#8197;nm) by varying excitation wavelengths. Diverse conformations in S0 and three local minima in S1 are crucial to these unique luminescent properties.







Abstract
Achieving wide&#8208;range tunable emission colors, especially in the solid state of single&#8208;fluorophore materials, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a molecular design strategy that affords wide&#8208;range excitation&#8208;dependent emissions spanning over &#8776;230&#8197;nm in crystalline states. Under the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration, we judiciously choose a rotatable acceptor fragment, o&#8208;carborane, to enrich conformational diversities in the crystalline state and generate conformation&#8208;dependent multicolor emissions. We further show that this molecular platform is generalizable in creating crystalline materials with multicolor emissions. Based on these materials, a high&#8208;capacity information storage device and a finite&#8208;state machine were fabricated to showcase multicolor displays and information storage.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Functional Evaluation of IORs, Sulfonolipid&#8208;based Inhibitors of Cell Differentiation in Salpingoeca rosetta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and modular synthesis of the rosette&#8208;inhibitor sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A and chemical probes was achieved via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivatives and alkyl zinc reagents of choice. Synthesized congeners and bifunctional probes allowed to determine structure&#8208;activity relation to profile binding partners in producer and recipient for the first time.







Abstract
The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S.&#8197;rosetta. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid&#8208;containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR&#8208;1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes, allowed quantification of IOR&#8208;1A, localization studies within S.&#8197;rosetta cells, and evaluation of structure&#8208;activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and S.&#8197;rosetta. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within S.&#8197;rosetta.

These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated and Robust Superhydrophobic Modification on Covalent Organic Framework for Crude&#8208;Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schiff base condensation and 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions are used to develop and decorate a new covalent organic framework (COF) to associate superhydrophobicity, that performs at severe settings. The embedded superhydrophobicity was used for cleaning oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, irrespective of nature of selected oils and used surfactants.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) having high specific surface area, tunable pore size and high crystallinity are mostly post modified following fluorine&#8208;based and complex synthetic approaches to achieve a bio&#8208;inspired liquid wettability, i.e. superhydrophobicity. Herein, a facile, non&#8208;fluorinated and robust chemical approach is introduced for tailoring the water wettability of a new COF&#8212;which was prepared through Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. A silane precursor was readily reacted with selected alkyl acrylates through 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction, prior to grafting on the prepared C4&#8208;COF for tailoring different water wettability&#8212;including robust superhydrophobicity. The superhydrophobic C4&#8208;COF (SH&#8208;C4&#8208;COF) that displayed significantly enhanced (&gt;5&#8197;times; from 220&#8197;wt.&#8201;% to 1156&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) oil&#8208;absorption capacity, was extended to address the relevant challenges of &#8220;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; emulsion separation, rapidly (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitively (50&#8197;times) at diverse and harsh conditions.

         <title>Synergistic Charge Percolation in Conducting Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance In Vivo Sensing of Neurochemical and Neuroelectrical Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach that endows conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;based fiber&#8208;microsensors with an interiorly constructed synergistic charge percolation highway for (i)&#8197;selective and sensitive sensing of a target neurochemical (vitamin C) and (ii)&#8197;high&#8208;fidelity sensing of neuronal activities. This strategy is validated through in vivo applications in the nervous system.







Abstract
Challenges remain in establishing a universal method to precisely tune electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for multifunctional neurosensing with high selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and general approach to achieving synergistic charge percolation in conducting polymers (i.e., poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) by incorporating conductive catalysts (i.e., carbon nanotubes, CNTs) and post&#8208;processing. The approach shows synergistic effects: (i)&#8197;CNTs and post&#8208;processing together promote PEDOT ordered interconnection for highly efficient charge percolation that accelerates electrochemical kinetics; (ii)&#8197;CNTs catalyze the electrooxidation of vitamin C for selective electrochemical sensing; (iii)&#8197;CNTs enhance the charge storage/injection capacity of PEDOT:PSS. The prepared CNT&#8208;PEDOT:PSS fiber mechanically matches with neural tissues and is proved to be a biocompatible versatile microsensor capable of high&#8208;performance neurosensing in vivo.

Abstract
We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;&#8208;alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenyl&#8208;substituted chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;&#8208;vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with R absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with S absolute configuration. Unusual substrate&#8208;catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.

         <title>Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane by Platinum&#8208;Nickel Dimers: Regulation of Heteroatom Interspace Boosts Bifunctional Synergetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt1Ni1/C3N4 dimeric catalyst exhibits a much higher activity than Pt1/C3N4 in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for hydrogen generation. A bifunctional synergy is revealed in which the bridging OH in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers promotes H2O dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of the B&#8722;H bond, thus cooperatively accelerating hydrogen production.







Abstract
Regulation of the atom&#8208;atom interspaces of dual&#8208;atom catalysts is essential to optimize the dual&#8208;atom synergy to achieve high activity but remains challenging. Herein, we report an effective strategy to regulate the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace to achieve Pt1Ni1 dimers and Pt1+Ni1 heteronuclear dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (HDSACs) by tailoring steric hindrance between metal precursors during synthesis. Spectroscopic characterization reveals obvious electron transfers in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers but not in Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), the H2 formation rates show an inverse proportion to the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace. The rate of Pt1Ni1 dimers is &#8776;13 and 2&#8197;times higher than those of Pt1 and Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC, manifesting the interspace&#8208;dependent synergy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the bridging OH group in Pt1Ni1 dimers promotes water dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of B&#8722;H bonds in AB, which boosts a bifunctional synergy to accelerate H2 production cooperatively.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Ester Electrolyte with Boosted Stability Against Li for High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with NO3&#8722; readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath that reduces the polarity of solvent and therefore boosts the stability of electrolyte against Li metal. The electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The Li plating/stripping reversibility in Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;%.







Abstract
In traditional non&#8208;flammable electrolytes a trade&#8208;off always exists between non&#8208;flammability and battery performance. Previous research focused on reducing free solvents and forming anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. However, the contribution of solvated anions in boosting the stability of electrolyte has been overlooked. Here, we resolve this via introducing anions into Li+ solvation sheaths using anions with similar Gutmann donor number (DN) to that of solvents. Taking trimethyl phosphate fire&#8208;retardant (DN=23.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (DN=22.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as an example, NO3&#8722; is readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath and reduces the polarity of solvent. This results in boosted stability of electrolyte against Li. The developed non&#8208;flammable electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The reversibility of Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;% and the lifespan of practical LMBs was extended by &gt;100&#8201;%.

         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

A versatile continuous flow platform for the generation of concentrated dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) solution with accurate and tunable concentration is reported. It unlocks the use of N2O3 in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles in flow and batch.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N2O3 is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N2O3 solution (up to 1&#8197;M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N2O3 concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles&#8212;a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the N&#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.

         <title>Visualization of Protein&#8208;Specific Glycation in Living Cells via Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a strategy for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation based on bioorthogonal chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout, which provide a powerful tool for analysing protein glycation and their corresponding biological functions in living cells.







Abstract
Due to the lack of suitable chemical tools, probing the protein&#8208;specific glycation is highly challenging. Herein, we present a strategy based on glycation chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation in living cells. We first developed a bioorthogonal glucose analogue, 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (6AzGlc), as a novel glycation chemical reporter. Two types of DNA probes, glycation conversion probe and protein targeting probe, were designed to attach to glycation adducts and target proteins, respectively. After the protein was glycated by 6AzGlc, two DNA probes were sequentially applied to the target protein, triggering proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout. This strategy was successfully used to visualize glucose glycation of several proteins, including PD&#8208;L1 and integrin. More importantly, this strategy allowed us to analyze corresponding biological functions of glycated protein in the native environment.

         <title>Missing&#8208;linker Defects in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>

The defect engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of facilitated transport covalent organic framework membranes with missing&#8208;linker defects for efficient CO2 separation.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ordered channels and free organic groups hold great promise in molecular separations owing to the synergy of physical and chemical microenvironments. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to fabricate COF membranes for efficient CO2 separation. Abundant amino groups are in situ generated on the COF nanosheets arising from the missing&#8208;linker defects during the reactive assembly of amine monomer and mixed aldehyde monomers. The COF nanosheets are assembled to fabricate COF membranes. Amino groups, as the CO2 facilitated transport carriers, along with ordered channels endow COF membrane with high CO2 permeances exceeding 300&#8197;GPU and excellent separation selectivity of 80 for CO2/N2, and 54 for CO2/CH4 mixed gas under humidified state. Our defect engineering strategy offers a facile approach to generating free organic functional groups in COF membranes and other organic framework membranes for diverse chemical separations.

A &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer, containing both a furan&#8208;protected maleimide (FMI) monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. Due to the dynamic nature of the r&#8208;DA reaction of FMI, the release of maleimide (MI) and the subsequent copolymerization of MI can be regulated by tuning the temperature and stereochemistry during its SCVCP.







Abstract
An efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (LI&#8208;Br), containing a furan&#8208;protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (r&#8208;DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the r&#8208;DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star&#8208;shaped and long&#8208;chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy for the structure-controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (&lt;b&gt;LI-Br&lt;/b&gt;), containing a furan-protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a &lt;i&gt;retro&lt;/i&gt;-Diels&#8211;Alder (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self-condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one-pot&#8221; structure-controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star-shaped and long-chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Initiated Synthesis of Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methanesulfonic acid was achieved from only methane and oleum in an electrochemical reactor. At the boron&#8208;doped diamond anode the species is formed, which initiates the catalytic cycle where methane is selectively sulfonated to the product. A concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) was achieved at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The direct sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid was achieved in an electrochemical reactor without adding peroxide initiators. The synthesis proceeds only from oleum and methane. This is possible due to in situ formation of an initiating species from the electrolyte at a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode. Elevated pressure, moderate temperature and suitable current density are beneficial to reach high concentration at outstanding selectivity. The highest concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) at 97&#8201;% selectivity was reached with a stepped electric current program at 6.25&#8211;12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours. We present a novel, electrochemical method to produce methanesulfonic acid, propose a reaction mechanism and show general dependencies between parameters and yields for methanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Olefin&#8211;Borane Interactions in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Fluorophores that Undergo Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8211;borane interaction can be used to modulate the electron&#8208;accepting ability of boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores with alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl groups exhibit response even to a bulky Lewis base through a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP)&#8208;type addition. Reversible association/dissociation behavior of the adduct is observed in response to temperature over a range above ambient temperature.







Abstract
Olefin&#8211;borane &#960;&#8208;complexes have been postulated as intermediates for the addition of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to olefins. In the present study, we have employed this weak interaction to modulate the electronic properties of boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorophores that contain an alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl group is synthesized. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the olefin and boron moieties are held in close proximity. Upon addition of a Lewis base to a solution of these D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A fluorophores, an FLP&#8208;type addition occurs with concurrent significant changes in the absorption and emission properties. The FLP&#8208;type reaction shifts the reaction site from the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron atom to a carbocationic center, and thereby even facilitates a reaction with bulky Lewis bases. For example, a tricyclohexylphosphine adduct thus generated exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent reversible dissociation/association behavior. These results provide a design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive emissive boron&#8208;based materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) from binary to high&#8208;entropy was fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. When used as sulfur hosts, high&#8208;entropy PBA can act as polysulfide immobilizers and catalysts to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Moreover, metal oxides derived from high&#8208;entropy PBA possess good electronic properties, which can prompt the further research of high&#8208;entropy PBA derivatives.







Abstract
The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials. Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate that high&#8208;entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance. Additionally, a variety of nanocubic metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our coprecipitation and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nitric Oxide for Biomedical Applications</title>

An electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (Fe SAC) is developed for high&#8208;efficient and controlled generation of nitric oxide (NO). The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both therapeutic and mechanistic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications. The efficient and on&#8208;demand NO generation essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal NO generation rate achieving 2.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;(min&#8201;&#956;g)&#8722;1. Theoretical studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO2&#8722; adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. For antibacterial application, the generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains, highlighting a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.

         <title>Strong Anharmonicity&#8208;Induced Low Thermal Conductivity and High n&#8208;type Mobility in the Topological Insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low lattice thermal conductivity and high electron mobility provide promising thermoelectric performance in a 3D topological insulator, Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S. The low thermal conductivity originates from the strong anharmonicity, while the high carrier mobility results from metallic suface states in the topological insulator.

Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#956;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &#956; due to the metallic surface states. TIs with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low &#954;lat. Here, we demonstrate that Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat of 0.46&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 along with high &#956; of &#8776;401&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. BSTS possesses low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the &#954;lat resulting in a promising n&#8208;type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8776;0.6 at 573&#8197;K.

         <title>High&#8208;Power Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous All Organic Redox Flow Battery Enabled with a Pair of Anionic Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) operating upon a pair of judiciously designed anionic viologen and TEMPO derivatives, endows the near&#8208;neutral electrolyte systems with compatibility to the cation&#8208;exchange membrane (CEM), high cell voltage, excellent cycling stability and record&#8208;high power density.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are regarded as a promising alternative for low&#8208;cost and durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the narrow potential gap, chemical lability and membrane fouling in most AORFBs constitute formidable roadblocks for practical applications. Herein, a pair of anionic organic molecules, namely (PPBPy)Br2 and PSS&#8208;TEMPO, are proposed. The (PPBPy)Br2 in anolyte reveals remarkable electrochemical stability without degradation after 1000&#8197;cycles, while PSS&#8208;TEMPO in catholyte presents a capacity decay rate as low as 0.012&#8201;%/cycle. At near&#8208;neutral conditions, the (PPBPy)Br2/PSS&#8208;TEMPO flow cell exhibits a high voltage of 1.61&#8197;V, extremely low permeability across cation&#8208;exchange membrane and thus excellent cycling stability. Notably, a highest peak power density of 509&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved among reported all&#8208;organic aqueous RFBs. The molecular engineering strategies demonstrated here could provide a credible example of high&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Lead Against Acinetobacter baumannii 17978</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Sixteen oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharide of A. baumannii 17978 are the basis for serum and antibody screening to identify a vaccine lead.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious nosocomial infections that is becoming increasingly resistant against antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that cover A. baumannii are a major virulence factor that play an important role in pathogenesis, are used to assign serotypes and provide the basis for vaccine development. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of A. baumannii 17978 were printed onto microarray slides and used to screen sera from patients infected with A. baumannii as well as a monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb C8). A synthetic oligosaccharide emerged from glycan array screening as lead for the development of a vaccine against A. baumannii 17978. Tetrasaccharide 20 is a key epitope for recognition by an antibody and is a vaccine lead.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Circulating Vector for Aptamers Based upon Polyphosphodiester&#8208;Backboned Molecular Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottlebrush polymer&#8208;aptamer biohybrid, termed PSP pacDNA, is prepared using solid&#8208;phase and graft&#8208;onto methodologies. Consisting of a polyphosphodiester backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains, the PSP pacDNA suppresses non&#8208;specific interactions with the cell and improves the plasma pharmacokinetics of the aptamer. Combined with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer, the PSP pacDNA produces a pronounced anticoagulation effect in vivo.







Abstract
Aptamers face challenges for use outside the ideal conditions in which they are developed. These difficulties are most palpable in vivo due to nuclease activities, rapid clearance, and off&#8208;target binding. Herein, we demonstrate that a polyphosphodiester&#8208;backboned molecular brush can suppress enzymatic digestion, reduce non&#8208;specific cell uptake, enable long blood circulation, and rescue the bioactivity of a conjugated aptamer in vivo. The backbone along with the aptamer is assembled via solid&#8208;phase synthesis, followed by installation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains using a two&#8208;step process with near&#8208;quantitative efficiency. The synthesis allows for precise control over polymer size and architecture. Consisting entirely of building blocks that are generally recognized as safe for therapeutics, this novel molecular brush is expected to provide a highly translatable route for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Programming and Dynamic Control of the Circular Polarization of Luminescence from an Achiral Fluorescent Dye in a Liquid Crystal Host by Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

MCELDs (Molecular&#8208;machine&#8208;based CPL&#8208;emitting LC devices) are prepared by mixing molecular motors and BODIPYs in liquid crystal mixtures. This system shows robust CPL switching, orthogonal excitation on molecular motors and fluorescent dyes, tunable CPL color and programmable CPL control.







Abstract
Circular polarized light is utilized in communication and display technologies and a major challenge is to develop systems that can be switched between left and right circular polarized luminescence with high degrees of polarization and enable multiple addressable stable states. Luminescent dyes in Liquid Crystal (LC) cholesteric phases are attractive systems to generate, amplify and modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In the present study, we employ light&#8208;driven molecular motors as photo&#8208;controlled chiral dopants in LCs to switch the handedness of the LC and the circular polarization of luminescence from an achiral dye embedded in the mesogenic material. Tuning of the color of the CPL and the retention time of the photoprogrammed helicity is demonstrated making use of a variety of motors and dyes. The flexibility offered by the design based on inherently chiral unidirectional rotary motors provides full control over CPL non&#8208;invasively by light, opening possibilities for pixilated displays with externally addressable polarization.

         <title>Closed Aromatic Tubes&#8212;Capsularenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenes can now be incorporated into closed tubes&#8212;capsularenes. These rigid, electron deficient, thermally stable, and tubular molecules with three arenes or acenes at a close distance can lend themselves to the construction of organic electronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name capsularenes. First, we prepared vase&#8208;shaped molecular baskets 4&#8211;7. The baskets comprise a benzene base fused to three bicycle[2.2.1]heptane rings that extend into phthalimide (4), naphthalimide (6), and anthraceneimide sides (7), each carrying a dimethoxyethane acetal group. In the presence of catalytic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the acetals at top of 4, 6 and 7 change into aliphatic aldehydes followed by their intramolecular cyclization into 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (1H NMR spectroscopy). Such ring closure is nearly a quantitative process that furnishes differently sized capsularenes 1 (0.7&#215;0.9&#8197;nm), 8 (0.7&#215;1.1&#8197;nm;) and 9 (0.7&#215;1.4&#8197;nm;) characterized by X&#8208;Ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction, UV/Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and thermogravimetry. With exceptional rigidity, unique topology, great thermal stability, and perhaps tuneable optoelectronic characteristics, capsularenes hold promise for the construction of novel organic electronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Fleeting NiIII Bisphenoxyl Diradical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiII(salen) complexes have been one of the most promising avenues for those aiming to generate high valent Ni species. The present work is a result of one such inquisitiveness where a NiII(salen) complex was treated with mCPBA to form a novel NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. Various spectroscopic tools and theoretical calculations further assisted our observation. This proposed three electron oxidized species showed oxidation reactivity.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s and Galactose Oxidases exploit redox active ligands to form reactive high valent intermediates for oxidation reactions. This strategy works well for the late 3d metals where accessing high valent states is rather challenging. Herein, we report the oxidation of NiII(salen) (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;(1R,2R)&#8208;diamine) with mCPBA (meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form a fleeting NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species, in CH3CN and CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses using UV/Vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies revealed oxidation events both on the ligand and the metal centre to yield a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. DFT calculations found the electronic structure of the ligand and the d&#8208;configuration of the metal center to be consistent with a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. This three electron oxidized species can perform hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Bioinspired Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;Based Ionic Diode Membrane for High&#8208;Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic diode&#8208;type membranes with rectified current can avoid energy dissipation in the nanochannels during the osmotic energy conversion process. Herein, a bioinspired heterogeneous MXene membrane (BHMXM) is designed with extraordinary ionic rectification, when applied in osmotic energy conversion, the BHMXM&#8208;based power generator can yield a high power density of 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water.







Abstract
Bioinspired asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels with ionic diode behavior that can boost the osmotic energy (so&#8208;called blue energy) conversion are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily constructed and modified. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine hydrophilic surfaces and tunable surface charge properties, providing a shortcut to prepare asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels. Here, we report a mechanically robust, flexible, and scale&#8208;up&#8208;friendly asymmetric Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;based ionic diode membrane with a highly rectified current and demonstrate its potential use in reverse electrodialysis osmotic energy conversion. Under the salinity gradient of synthetic seawater and river water, our ionic diode membrane&#8208;based generator&#8216;s power density is 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 and up to 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The design of MXene&#8208;based ionic diode&#8208;type membrane provides a facile and general strategy in developing large&#8208;scale 2D nanofluidics and selective ion transport.

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, as a proof of concept we report that guest adsorption selectivity in nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor postsynthetic modification method. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest are the major factors in determining the guest selectivity.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone EtP4Q1 show negligible selectivity for C5 hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto EtP4Q1 NACs does not improve the selectivity, while EtP4Q1 NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of n&#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8211;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.

         <title>Central Unit Fluorination of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CH molecules with a new modification site on the central unit of Y&#8208;series electron acceptors has been designed and synthesized to afford better&#8208;performing organic solar cells (OSCs). Further fluorination on the largely unexplored central unit enabled significantly improved photovoltaic performance with over 18% efficiency for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs.







Abstract
Halogenation of terminal of acceptors has been shown to give dramatic improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Similar significant results could be expected from the halogenation of the central units of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Y&#8208;series acceptors. Herein, a pair of acceptors, termed CH6 and CH4, featuring a conjugation&#8208;extended phenazine central unit with and without fluorination, have been synthesized. The fluorinated CH6 has enhanced molecular interactions and crystallinity, superior fibrillar network morphology and improved charge generation and transport in blend films, thus affording a higher PCE of 18.33&#8201;% for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs compared to 16.49&#8201;% for the non&#8208;fluorinated CH4. The new central site offers further opportunities for structural optimization of Y&#8208;series molecules to afford better&#8208;performed OSCs and reveals the effectiveness of fluorination on central units.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Aza&#8208;Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine&#8208;responsive Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene organic nanoparticles are designed to induce ferroptosis and serve as sonosensitizer. These nanoparticles promote ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy, inducing cancer cell death and tumor growth suppression.







Abstract
The presence of apoptosis inhibition proteins renders the cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, severely compromising the antitumor efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here, an intelligent anticancer nanoplatform based on an Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dye (denoted as Aza&#8208;BDY) is elaborately established for ferroptosis augmented SDT through cysteine (Cys) starvation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, Aza&#8208;BDY serves as both a ferroptosis inducing agent and a sonosensitizer for tumor treatment. The specific Cys response facilitates the disruption of redox homeostasis and initiation of cellular ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation significantly induces cancer&#8208;cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Photocatalytic Removal of the Greenhouse Gas Nitrous Oxide by Liposomal Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled liposome microreactors mimic the spatial separation of redox reactions seen in respiration and photosynthesis. Catalytic reduction of the climate heating gas N2O to benign N2 by encapsulated enzyme is driven by irradiation of external carbon dots through an electron transfer pathway defined by a membrane&#8208;spanning cytochrome and redox&#8208;cycling of internal methyl viologen.







Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse and ozone&#8208;reactive gas for which emissions are growing rapidly due to increasingly intensive agriculture. Synthetic catalysts for N2O decomposition typically contain precious metals and/or operate at elevated temperatures driving a desire for more sustainable alternatives. Here we demonstrate self&#8208;assembly of liposomal microreactors enabling catalytic reduction of N2O to the climate neutral product N2. Photoexcitation of graphitic N&#8208;doped carbon dots delivers electrons to encapsulated N2O Reductase enzymes via a lipid&#8208;soluble biomolecular wire provided by the MtrCAB protein complex. Within the microreactor, electron transfer from MtrCAB to N2O Reductase is facilitated by the general redox mediator methyl viologen. The liposomal microreactors use only earth&#8208;abundant elements to catalyze N2O removal in ambient, aqueous conditions.

         <title>Tetrazine Linkers as Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Tags for General Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Functionalization and C60 Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous UiO&#8208;68 tetrazine metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is used for post&#8208;synthetic ligation chemistry. The central tetrazine rings act as tags for straightforward framework functionalization by a one&#8208;step reaction with alkene, alkyne dienophiles or fullerene. This approach respects the structural integrity of the parent MOF and offers opportunities for functionalization as well as the integration of C60 in crystalline materials.







Abstract
The value of covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification in expanding the chemistry and pore versatility of reticular solids is well documented. Here we use mesoporous crystals of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;68&#8208;TZDC to demonstrate the value of tetrazine connectors for all&#8208;purpose inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder ligation chemistry. Our results suggest a positive effect of tetrazine reticulation over its reactivity for quantitative one&#8208;step functionalization with a broad scope of alkene or alkyne dienophiles into pyridazine and dihydropyridazine frameworks. This permits generating multiple pore environments with diverse chemical functionalities and the expected accessible porosities, that is also extended to the synthesis of crystalline fulleretic materials by covalent conjugation of fullerene molecules.

         <title>Mechanochemically Generated Calcium&#8208;Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanochemical technique, we have achieved for the first time the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (Ar&#8722;CaX) from commercially available, unactivated calcium metal without applying any pre&#8208;activation process. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles under mechanochemical conditions.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium&#8208;based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents. This method will allow synthetic chemists to readily access the novel and unique reactivity of organocalcium nucleophiles.

         <title>Between Elemental Match and Mismatch: From K12Ge3.5Sb6 to Salts of (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722;, and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;</title>

Extraction of the intermetallic phase &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221;, actually comprising the new single&#8208;crystalline compound K12Ge3.5Sb6, yields the long sought&#8208;for binary anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; and larger ones, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, which place the Ge/Sb combination at the border of elemental match and mismatch. The yet unknown diversity of these binary species predicts a rich follow&#8208;up chemistry.







Abstract
The solid mixture &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221; was shown to comprise single&#8208;crystalline K12Ge3.5Sb6 (1), a double salt of K5[GeSb3] with carbonate&#8208;like [GeSb3]5&#8722; anions, and the metallic Zintl phase K2Ge1.5. Extraction of 1 with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine in the presence of crypt&#8208;222 afforded [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of several novel binary Zintl anions: (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; (in 2), (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; (in 3), and in the presence of [AuMePPh3] also (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722; (in 4). The anion in 2 represents a predicted, yet heretofore missing pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral anion. 4 comprises a cluster analogous to (Ge4Bi14)4&#8722; and (Ga2Bi16)4&#8722;, and thus one of the most Sb&#8208;rich binary p&#8208;block anions. The unprecedented cluster topology in 3 can be viewed as a defect&#8208;version of the one in 4 upon following a &#8220;dead end&#8221; of cluster growth. The findings indicate that Ge and Sb atoms are at the border of a well&#8208;matching and a mismatch elemental combination. We discuss the syntheses, the geometric structures, and the electronic structures of the new compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Macrocyclic Triangles into Helicity&#8208;Opposite Nanotwists by Competitive Planar over Point Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar chirality emerging from the restriction rotation of achiral edges in macrocyclic triangles containing chiral vertices has led to chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to solution systems, where chiroptical properties are exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerging planar chirality arising from intermolecular stacking controls the chiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
While helix has elegant biomimetic structures and functionalities, it still remains a big question how the nanoscale helicity evolved from the molecular chiral building blocks across length scales. Herein, macrocyclic triangles composed of achiral edges and chiral vertices were rationally designed, in which the planar chirality emerged due to the restriction of edge rotation by intermolecular stackings and led to a unique chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to the solution systems where the chiroptical property is exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerged planar chirality was found to control the chiral self&#8208;assembly, resulting the nanotwist with the handedness determined by the planar chirality. Our work unveiled the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of macrocyclic conformers for the first time and provided a deep understanding on the macrocyclic chirality evolution including the excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self&#8208;Cleaving Ribozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
General base knockout in nucleolytic ribozymes using deazaguanosine&#8208;modified mutants paves the way to scale the relative contributions of the four main strategies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) applied in ribozyme general acid base catalysis.







Abstract
Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid&#8208;base catalysis to perform phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group to attack the scissile phosphate (&#947;&#8208;catalysis). Here, we present an atomic mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, &#8220;general base knockout&#8221; by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 2.7&#8208;fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that &#947;&#8208;catalysis critically depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that &#947;&#8208;catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic factors (&#945; and &#948;). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic contributions (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site guanines.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tetracyclic Pyridinium Alkaloid epi&#8208;Tetradehydrohalicyclamine&#8197;B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conquest of a polycyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid was only made possible by the remarkable chemoselectivity profile of contemporary transition metal catalysts that operate in the presence of basic sites. Ni/Ir photoredox catalysis, Mo&#8208;alkylidynes for alkyne metathesis, and an Ir&#8208;catalyzed lactam&#8208;selective hydrosilylation stand out in this regard.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of a tetracyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid hinged on recent advances in chemoselectivity management: While many classical methods failed to afford the perceptively simple pyridine&#8208;containing core of the target, nickel/iridium photoredox dual catalysis allowed the critical C&#8722;C bond to be formed in good yield. Likewise, ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) worked well in the presence of the unhindered pyridine despite the innately Lewis acidic Mo(+6) center of the alkylidyne catalyst. Finally, an iridium catalyzed hydrosilylation was uniquely effective in reducing a tertiary amide without compromising an adjacent pyridine and the lateral double bonds; this transformation is largely without precedent. The second strained macrocycle enveloping the core was closed by intramolecular N&#8208;alkylation with formation of the pyridinium unit; the reaction proceeded site&#8208; and chemoselectively in the presence of an a priori more basic tertiary amine.

         <title>A 3D Peptide/[60]Fullerene Hybrid for Multivalent Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent ligand presentation is a powerful strategy for the development of specific binders and inhibitors. Peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids have now been synthesized that exploit the complete substitution of the fullerene scaffold to afford globular structures presenting twelve copies of a peptide ligand for the recognition of E&#8208;selectin.







Abstract
Fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts offer an excellent opportunity for multivalent protein recognition. In contrast to monofunctionalized fullerene hybrids, peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts display multiple copies of a peptide in close spatial proximity and in the three dimensions of space. High affinity peptide binders for almost any target can be currently identified by in vitro evolution techniques, often providing synthetically simpler alternatives to natural ligands. However, despite the potential of peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts, these promising conjugates have not been reported to date. Here we present a synthetic strategy for the construction of 3D multivalent hybrids that are able to bind with high affinity the E&#8208;selectin. The here synthesized fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids and their multivalent recognition of natural receptors constitute a proof of principle for their future application as functional biocompatible materials.

&lt;p&gt;Multivalent ligand presentation is a powerful strategy for the development of specific binders and inhibitors. Peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids have now been synthesized that exploit the complete substitution of the fullerene scaffold to afford globular structures presenting twelve copies of a peptide ligand for the recognition of E-selectin.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryldifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with Aryldifluoromethyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes is shown to form diaryl difluoromethanes. A simple dialkyl(dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand for palladium, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;interactions between palladium and the difluorobenzyl ligand during reductive elimination, and a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes enabled the reaction to form diverse products, including those possessing biological activities.







Abstract
Diaryl difluoromethanes are valuable targets for medicinal chemistry because they are bioisosteres of diaryl ethers and can function as replacements for diaryl methane, ketone, and sulfone groups. However, methods to prepare diaryl difluoromethanes are scarce, especially methods starting from abundant aryl halides. We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryldifluoromethylation of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes (TMSCF2Ar). The reaction occurs when the catalyst contains a simple, but unusual, dialkylaryl phosphine ligand that promotes transmetallation of the silane. Computational studies show that reductive elimination following transmetallation occurs with a low barrier, despite the fluorine atoms on the &#945;&#8208;carbon, due to coordination of the difluorobenzyl &#960;&#8208;system to palladium. The co&#8208;development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes broadened the scope of the process including several applications to the synthesis biologically relevant diaryl difluoromethanes.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage derivatization was used to construct azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides through a radical azidation/heterocyclization cascade. This electrochemical oxidative strategy could be conducted under mild, efficient, and environmentally friendly conditions in buffer solution.







Abstract
As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing a Trp side chain through manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerance, high site selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87&#8201;%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing an azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives, such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.

         <title>Cooperative Surface Passivation and Hierarchical Structuring of Zeolite Beta Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) produces a zeolite with an epitaxially grown Si&#8208;rich shell on the exterior rim, which passivates the surface reactivity. It is also possible to enhance intracrystalline mesoporosity via secondary hydrothermal treatment by taking advantage of intrinsic silanol defects in *BEA.







Abstract
We report a method to prepare core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) with an aluminous core and an epitaxial Si&#8208;rich shell. This method capitalizes on the inherent defects in *BEA crystals to simultaneously passivate acid sites on external surfaces and increase intracrystalline mesoporosity through facile post&#8208;hydrothermal synthesis modification in alkaline media. This process creates more hydrophobic materials by reducing silanol defects and enriching the shell in silica via a combination of dealumination and the relocation of silica from the core to the shell during intracrystalline mesopore formation. The catalytic consequences of *BEA core&#8211;shells relative to conventional analogues were tested using the biomass conversion of levulinic acid and n&#8208;butanol to n&#8208;butyl levulinate as a benchmark reaction. Our findings reveal that siliceous shells and intracrystalline mesopores synergistically enhance the performance of *BEA catalysts.

Chiral quinacridines react chemo&#8208; and regioselectively with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII/RhII catalysis, up to four times, achieving a stepwise late&#8208;stage multi&#8208;functionalization of the [4]helicene scaffold. Absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging are readily tuned. Density&#8208;functional theory elucidates the carbene insertion selectivity and clarifies the importance of conformations in the optical response.







Abstract
Chiral quinacridines react up to four times, step&#8208;by&#8208;step, with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII and RhII catalysis. By selecting the catalyst, [CpRu(CH3CN)3][PF6] (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) or Rh2(oct)4, chemo and regioselective insertions of derived metal carbenes are achieved in favor of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized malonate derivatives, respectively, (r.r.&gt;49&#8201;:&#8201;1, up to 77&#8201;% yield, 12 examples). This multi&#8208;introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging. Density&#8208;functional theory further elucidates the origin of the carbene insertion selectivity and also showcases the importance of conformations in the optical response.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Binding Sites in a Chemically Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Separation</title>

We developed a novel strategy by engineering abundant supramolecular binding sites into a chemically stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a) to achieve simultaneously high C2H2 storage and selectivity, breaking the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Developing porous materials to overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation remains a challenge. Herein, we report a stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a), featuring large cages decorated with high density of supramolecular binding sites to achieve both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. ZJU&#8208;50a exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage capacity (192&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and concurrently high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (12) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;50a crystal unveil that the incorporated supramolecular binding sites can selectively take up C2H2 molecule but not CO2 to result in both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, providing a high C2H2 recovery capacity of 84.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% purity. This study suggests a novel strategy of engineering supramolecular binding sites into MOFs to overcome the trade&#8208;off for this separation.

         <title>Dearomative Aminocarbonylation of Arenes via Bifunctional Coordination to Chromium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium has been firstly developed for amide construction, which expands the boundary of aminocarbonylations from conventional C=C bond substrates to arenes. Furthermore, a switchable 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of arene C&#8722;H bonds and concise synthesis of amide&#8208;type drug analogs were successfully achieved.







Abstract
Amides are ubiquitous in physical and life sciences. Given the significant abundance of arenes, dearomative aminocarbonylation of arenes would lead to a large and underexplored chemical space for amide discovery. However, such reactions are challenging due to the high degree of resonance stabilization and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium, providing a modular platform for the construction of amides possessing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups and three&#8208;dimensional rings. Its versatility further enabled a switchable difluoromethylation or trifluoromethylation aminocarbonylation of arene C&#8722;H bonds. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments. Finally, the synthetic utility was well demonstrated by diverse applications in the total synthesis of CF3&#8208;functionalized amide&#8208;type drugs, including praziquantel, nateglinide, maraviroc and alloyohimbane.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Salinosporamide Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the total syntheses of salinosporamides and cinnabaramides via a strategy involving rapid construction of the highly decorated pyrrolidinone core of the natural products from the simple amino acid serine. The key to the success of this synthesis was to exploit the innate properties of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone as a stereochemical controller and unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Our first strategy for rapidly accessing pyrrolidinone cores of salinosporamides involved combined use of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution principles in aldol reactions of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone substrate, which was ultimately unsuccessful with respect to enantioselectivity. This failure led us to the revised strategy. The influence of the stereocenter in 5&#8208;oxazolidinone enabled selective installation of the C&#8208;2 stereocenter. The intramolecular aldol reaction of the C&#8208;2 stereodefined aldol substrate was successful. An unexpected hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was observed in hydrolyses of the bicyclic aldol products. This unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was utilized in preparing the pyrrolidinone core with excellent efficiency. Through this strategy, the concise total syntheses of salinosporamides A and B as well as cinnabaramides A, E, and F were achieved with high selectivity.

         <title>Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine Photoswitches: Conversion of Excitation Energy into Ring Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine (DBChD), exhibit distinct photo&#8208;switching characters with a high&#8208;energy E&#8208;configuration, especially for sulfur&#8208;bridged DBTD with an energy transduction efficiency of 21&#8201;% (&#951;) under 445&#8197;nm laser activation. Introducing oligothiophene &#960;&#8208;EDG on DBTD could further elevate the absorption &#955;max and coefficient &#1013;, reaching &#951;=29&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted, heteroaryl and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as three key strategies on morphology design of photoswitch to diversify controllability. Cyclic azobenzene is of particular utilization in photo&#8208;energy conversion due to rigid and ring&#8208;strain structure. Despite the well&#8208;recognized diazocine, the photo&#8208;switching properties of seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes (diazepines) have yet been exploited. Herein, we report a family of dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepines (DBChDs) and their T&#8208;type photo&#8208;switching nature with tunable relaxation rate. Based on experiments together with DFT calculations, we found that an unsymmetric 2&#8208;bithiophenyl&#8208;dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine exhibited an efficient response to 445&#8197;nm laser stimulation (quantum efficiency, &#934;Z&#8594;E=0.71) with millisecond relaxation half&#8208;life (t1/2=40&#8197;ms). Photo&#8208;energy transduction efficiency was also exceptionally high with 29.1&#8201;% converted into ring&#8208;strain energy mainly loaded on azo &#960;&#8208;bond.

Flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieves a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, a high mechanical robustness, which demonstrate potential in next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors have broad applications in medicine and industry. Although flexible lead&#8208;free perovskite films are competitive because of their lightweight and low toxicity, they are less efficient due to low charge transport. Herein, we report low&#8208;toxicity, flexible X&#8208;ray detectors based on p&#8208;type doped MA3Bi2I9 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite&#8208;filled membranes (PFMs). Strong coordination between dopant 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ) and MA3Bi2I9 and the establishment of charge&#8208;transfer complex (CPX) improved the conductivity by four times. The flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieved a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the highest values in all environmentally friendly flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Importantly, the PFMs retained excellent charge transport under mechanical stress. All of those make flexible MA3Bi2I9 membranes more competitive as next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Hydrogen Evolution and Zinc Ion Flux in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous Zn&#8208;COF@Zn anodes have been fabricated to synergistically manipulate the H2 evolution and Zn2+ flux, during which the closely related H2 qualification/inhibition and Zn dendrite&#8208;growth in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries have been studied.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical&#8208;capacity, safety, and low&#8208;cost, yet the H2&#8208;evolution, qualification or inhibition mechanism investigations that are closely related to the dendrite&#8208;growth are rare and challenging. Herein, a series of zincophilic metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (e.g., Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF, Zn&#8208;DAAQ&#8208;COF, and Zn&#8208;DAA&#8208;COF) have been explored as model&#8208;platforms to manipulate the H2&#8208;evolution and Zn2+ flux. Best of them, Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF based cell only produces 0.002&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;H2, which is &gt;2 orders of magnitude lower than bare Zn. Noteworthy, it affords high stability for 3000&#8197;cycles (overpotential, &lt;79.1&#8197;mV) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric&#8208;cell and enhanced cycling&#8208;stability up to 6000&#8197;cycles at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the assembled full&#8208;battery. Besides, mechanistic characterizations show that Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF can enhance the energy&#8208;barrier of H2&#8208;evolution and homogenize the ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed to achieve high performance.

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Lactonization of Enynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein the first oxidation of enynyl boronates for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, including spiro&#8208;, and fused&#8208;butanolides as well as butenolides that are prevalent in nature products and bioactive molecules. The asymmetric version of this oxidation was also achieved in the presence of chiral ketone and Oxone. This process successively involves the oxidation of C(sp)&#8722;B bond, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond, and the lactonization.







Abstract
Oxidation of C&#8722;B bonds is extensively used in organic synthesis, materials science, and chemically biology. However, these oxidations are usually limited to the oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;B and C(sp2)&#8722;B bonds. The C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation is rarely developed. Herein we present a novel strategy for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones via the oxidation of enynyl boronates. This process successively involves the C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond and the lactonization. This protocol provided various &#947;&#8208;lactones and unsaturated butenolides efficiently that are prevalent in numerous nature products and bioactive molecules. Most importantly, asymmetric oxidative lactonization of enynyl boronates was also achieved, providing chiral &#947;&#8208;lactones in high enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. The versatile transformations and ubiquity of &#947;&#8208;lactones shed light on the importance of this strategy in the construction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Single Au Atoms on Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction towards CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms in Au1&#8208;S2 low&#8208;coordination structure on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were prepared by a rational complex&#8208;exchange route. Endowed with much faster interfacial electron transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 photosensitizer and more appropriate binding strength with *CO intermediates, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms surpass Au nanoparticles counterpart in CO2 photoreduction, leading to CH4 product with both high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to hydrocarbon fuels such as CH4 is promising and sustainable for carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, lack of proper binding strengths with reaction intermediates makes it still a challenge for photocatalytic CO2 methanation with both high activity and selectivity. Here, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms (Au1&#8208;S2) on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets was synthesized by a complex&#8208;exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au1/ZnIn2S4 catalyst exhibits a CH4 yield of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity as high as 77&#8201;%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au1/ZnIn2S4 with Au1&#8208;S2 structure not only display fast carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH3 intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Nonsubstituted Quinoline&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidant&#8208;free locking of a dynamic imine bridge to construct the ultrastable nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is reported. This methodology features high efficiency, generality, retention of crystallinity and topology. The enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation facilitates photocatalytic organic transformations mediated by superoxide anion radicals.







Abstract
Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant&#8208;free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post&#8208;synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine&#8208;linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ&#8208;COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.

         <title>Open&#8208;Bandgap Graphene&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Using Oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;functionalized oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) (OPE) was introduced as an interface on wafer&#8208;scale graphene in the form of self&#8208;assembled monolayers through anion&#8208;based reaction. The band gap was opened by electron transfer from OPE to graphene via covalent bonding. This property offers high efficiency for graphene&#8208;based transistor applications.







Abstract
Organic interfacial compounds (OICs) are required as linkers for the highly stable and efficient immobilization of bioprobes in nanobiosensors using 2D nanomaterials such as graphene. Herein, we first demonstrated the fabrication of a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) via a microelectromechanical system process after covalent functionalization on large&#8208;scale graphene by introducing oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)amine (OPE). OPE was compared to various OICs by density functional theory simulations and was confirmed to have a higher binding energy with graphene and a lower band gap than other OICs. OPE can improve the immobilization efficiency of a bioprobe by forming a self&#8208;assembly monolayer via anion&#8208;based reaction. Using this technology, Magainin I&#8208;conjugated OGMFET (MOGMFET) showed a high sensitivity, high selectivity, with a limit of detection of 100&#8197;cfu&#8201;mL&#8722;1. These results indicate that the OPE OIC can be applied for stable and comfortable interfacing technology for biosensor fabrication.

         <title>Antineoplastic Enzyme as Drug Carrier with Activatable Catalytic Activity for Efficient Combined Therapy</title>

Glucose oxidase (GOx) as drug carrier delivers anticancer drugs including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. These nanodrugs show acid&#8208;activatable enzyme activity of GOx, thus allowing relatively safe intravenous administration of GOx and effective combination of GOx&#8208;mediated cancer starvation&#8208;like therapy and chemotherapy/photothermal therapy/tumor ferroptosis against 4T1 breast tumors.







Abstract
The delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) requires extra carriers, which suffers from early leakage and exposure of GOx. These issues will be of less concern if GOx itself acts as a drug carrier. However, the catalytic activity of GOx in the blood still needs to be inhibited. Herein, we found that GOx could self&#8208;assemble with hydrophobic molecules into uniform and stable nanoparticles (NPs), including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. The catalytic activity of GOx in NPs was significantly inhibited due to the binding of small molecules with its hydrophobic pockets. After dissociation in the tumor acidic microenvironment, the enzyme activity of GOx could be largely recovered. This acidity&#8208;triggered &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; process ensured safe intravenous administration of GOx&#8208;based NPs. In vivo experiments showed that the combined starvation therapy and ferroptosis/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy effectively inhibited 4T1 breast tumor growth.

By means of density functional theory calculations, ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETPs) were discovered as modular and cysteine&#8208;selective electrophiles for bioconjugation. Using CuI&#8208;click chemistry in aqueous buffers, this functional group can be easily introduced into azide&#8208;containing (bio&#8208;)molecules. These reagents can be used for proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling and to obtain functional peptide&#8208; and protein conjugates, as well as protein&#8211;protein conjugates .







Abstract
We report the density functional theory (DFT) guided discovery of ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETPs) as a new class of electrophilic warheads for cysteine selective bioconjugation. By using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) in aqueous buffer, we were able to access a variety of functional electrophilic building blocks, including proteins, from diethynyl&#8208;phosphinate. ETP&#8208;reagents were used to obtain fluorescent peptide&#8208;conjugates for receptor labelling on live cells and a stable and a biologically active antibody&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugate. Moreover, we were able to incorporate ETP&#8208;electrophiles into an azide&#8208;containing ubiquitin under native conditions and demonstrate their potential in protein&#8211;protein conjugation. Finally, we showcase the excellent cysteine&#8208;selectivity of this new class of electrophile in mass spectrometry based, proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling, underscoring the applicability in homogeneous bioconjugation strategies to connect two complex biomolecules.

         <title>Hydrolytically Stable Ionic Fluorogels for High&#8208;Performance Remediation of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a library of ion exchange resins that are selective for PFAS removal from real water enabled the evaluation of structure&#8211;property relationships of the chemically stable polymer networks with high PFAS affinity. The granular Ionic Fluorogel resin is a potent PFAS remediation sorbent and demonstrated excellent performance in translationally relevant flow&#8208;through packed bed columns using natural water.







Abstract
PFAS are known bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals which pollute natural waters globally. There exists a lack of granular sorbents to efficiently remove both legacy and emerging PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, we report a class of polymer networks with a synergistic combination of ionic and fluorous components that serve as granular materials for the removal of anionic PFAS from water. A library of Ionic Fluorogels (IFs) with systematic variation in charge density and polymer network architecture was synthesized from hydrolytically stable fluorous building blocks. The IFs were demonstrated as effective sorbents for the removal of 21 legacy and emerging PFAS from a natural water and were regenerable over multiple cycles of reuse. Comparison of one IF to a commercial ion exchange resin in mini&#8208;rapid small&#8208;scale column tests demonstrated superior performance for the removal of short&#8208;chain PFAS from natural water under operationally relevant conditions.

     alt="Hydrolytically Stable Ionic Fluorogels for High-Performance Remediation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) from Natural Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design and synthesis of a library of ion exchange resins that are selective for PFAS removal from real water enabled the evaluation of structure&#8211;property relationships of the chemically stable polymer networks with high PFAS affinity. The granular Ionic Fluorogel resin is a potent PFAS remediation sorbent and demonstrated excellent performance in translationally relevant flow-through packed bed columns using natural water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PFAS are known bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals which pollute natural waters globally. There exists a lack of granular sorbents to efficiently remove both legacy and emerging PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, we report a class of polymer networks with a synergistic combination of ionic and fluorous components that serve as granular materials for the removal of anionic PFAS from water. A library of Ionic Fluorogels (IFs) with systematic variation in charge density and polymer network architecture was synthesized from hydrolytically stable fluorous building blocks. The IFs were demonstrated as effective sorbents for the removal of 21 legacy and emerging PFAS from a natural water and were regenerable over multiple cycles of reuse. Comparison of one IF to a commercial ion exchange resin in mini-rapid small-scale column tests demonstrated superior performance for the removal of short-chain PFAS from natural water under operationally relevant conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Chemokine Conjugates for In Vivo Targeting of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for selective targeting of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in preclinical models of cancer. We demonstrate that this new chemical design is compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic payloads, opening avenues in the preparation of future theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Increased levels of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are indicators of poor prognosis in most cancers. Although antibodies and small molecules blocking the recruitment of macrophages to tumors are under evaluation as anticancer therapies, these strategies are not specific for macrophage subpopulations. Herein we report the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for effective targeting of defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. Our constructs exploit the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in TAMs to target these cells selectively over other macrophages and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cathepsin&#8208;activatable chemokines are compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic cargos, opening new avenues in the design of targeted theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

First explorations of binary Ge/Sb Zintl anions indicated a situation between a &#8220;matching&#8221; one and one that tends to element segregation owing to a mismatch in atom sizes. Extraction of the ternary solid K12Ge3.5Sb6 allowed access to the so far missing P4&#8208;like anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, as well as to species that show tendencies for spatial separation of Ge and Sb atoms, &#8220;incomplete&#8221; (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and &#8220;complete&#8221; (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, as confirmed by DFT calculations and described by Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202207232).

A self&#8208;assembled glucose oxidase (GOx) nanoparticle that falls into the sea and dissociates into several enzymes is depicted in the picture illustrating the Research Article by Peng Huang and co&#8208;workers (e202208583). After dissociation, GOx regains its catalytic activity and catalyzes the oxidization of glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2. It's like someone pressing the &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2&#8221; switch that crosses the sea surface.

         <dc:description>
A ball&#8208;milling approach allows the efficient activation of calcium metal and thus makes the direct generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents feasible without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. By using this operationally simple method, Koji Kubota, Hajime Ito, and co&#8208;workers developed a novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles in their Research Article (e202207118), which is typically difficult using conventional Grignard reagents.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to fibrous membrane materials owing to the complex healing mechanism and particular porous structure. In this Minireview self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes are introduced and described in detail in terms of design strategies and preparation methods. The current state of the art, existing challenges, and future outlook for this promising field are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Inspired by the self&#8208;healing function of living organisms, self&#8208;healing materials have been developed in recent decades to very high standards. As a new direction, self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes (SFMs) exhibit both the configuration of a porous structure and self&#8208;healing capability within one material. Different from nonporous self&#8208;healing materials, it is more challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to porous fibrous membrane materials owing to the more complex healing mechanism and microstructure of SFMs. This Minireview focuses on the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, design principles, and preparation strategies of SFMs. The characteristics of SFM self&#8208;healing performance are introduced in detail, and insights and perspectives of SFM preparation and healing mechanisms are put forward. Furthermore, remaining challenges and future developments of SFMs are presented, where the ultimate goal is the design of highly efficient self&#8208;healing and superstable fibrous membranes.

         <title>Physical and Chemical Cues at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface for Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulation has made tremendous progress in fighting diseases. In the past decade, it was demonstrated that nanomaterials can directly induce immunomodulation. To summarize this emerging research field, we systematically discuss a series of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface in order to better understand nanomaterials&#8208;regulated immunosignaling pathways as well as the outcomes in disease control and treatment.







Abstract
Immunomodulation has made remarkable progress in fighting infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relies on chemical/biochemical agents, which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off&#8208;target adverse effects. Recent insights into nano&#8211;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno&#8208;signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies on the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials to trigger immunological signaling. First, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge, and heat at the nano&#8211;bio interface for immunomodulation. Then, various nanomaterials enabled chemical cues, such as metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on challenges and possible future directions are provided.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Quenchers for F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Structure, Mechanism, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we focus on the quenching mechanisms, types, and biomedical applications of these quenchers. We give an in&#8208;depth discussion of their structure&#8211;property relationship and discuss the potentials and challenges of the quenchers in biomedical applications.







Abstract
For fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, and are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small&#8208;molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This Review is intended to provide suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8211;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.

         <title>How Subtle Changes Can Make a Difference: Reproducibility in Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of complex systems often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and narrow windows of suitable conditions. In this Scientific Perspective, we report on unexpected observations made in our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. We draw attention to often overlooked details and aim to initiate an open discussion on reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The desire to construct complex molecular systems is driven by the need for technological (r)evolution and our intrinsic curiosity to comprehend the origin of life. Supramolecular chemists tackle this challenge by combining covalent and noncovalent reactions leading to multicomponent systems with emerging complexity. However, this synthetic strategy often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and a narrow window of suitable conditions. Here, we report on unsuspected observations of our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. Based on the effects of pathway complexity, minute amounts of water in organic solvents or small impurities in the supramolecular building block, we discuss potential pitfalls in the study of complex systems. This article is intended to draw attention to often overlooked details and to initiate an open discussion on the importance of reporting experimental details to increase reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring Bond Microenvironments and Reaction Pathways of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) in water electrolysis is critical to guide the future design, performance optimization, and broad applications of single&#8208;atom catalysts. This Review summarizes the most recent progress in tailoring the bond microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts on different supports and discusses the reaction pathways, mechanisms, and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) are commonly stabilized and influenced by neighboring atoms in the host; disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of SASs in water electrolysis is one of the grand challenges originating from the tremendous wealth of support materials with complex structures. Through a multidisciplinary view of the design principles, synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlations, this timely Review is dedicated to summarizing the most recent progress in tailoring bond microenvironments on different supports and discussing the reaction pathways and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis. The essence and mechanisms of how SAS structures influence electrocatalysis and the critical requirements for future developments are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are also provided to stimulate the practical, widespread utilization of SAS catalysts in water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.

         <title>An Fe6C Core in All Nitrogenase Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Earlier spectroscopic and structural studies have shown that the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases contain a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide. Here, we used valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (VtC XES) to probe the presence of a carbide in the cofactor of iron nitrogenase. The presence of a K&#946;&#8242;&#8242; peak at 7100&#8197;eV reveals an interstitial carbon, showing that the cofactor of Fe nitrogenase contains an Fe6C core.







Abstract
The biological process of dinitrogen reduction to ammonium occurs at the cofactors of nitrogenases, the only enzymes that catalyze this challenging chemical reaction. Three types of nitrogenases have been described, named according to the heterometal in their cofactor: molybdenum, vanadium or iron nitrogenases. Spectroscopic and structural characterization allowed the unambiguous identification of the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases and revealed a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide in both of them. Although genetic studies suggested that the cofactor of the iron nitrogenase contains a similar Fe6C core, this has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report Valence&#8208;to&#8208;Core X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy providing experimental evidence that this cofactor contains a carbide, thereby making the Fe6C core a feature of all nitrogenase cofactors.

         <title>Ketenes in the Induction of the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy identifies ketene and methylketene intermediates in methyl acetate conversion over the HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. The surface acetyl to olefins mechanism proceeds via methylation and decarbonylation processes.







Abstract
Ketene (CH2=C=O) has been postulated as a key intermediate for the first olefin production in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed chemistry of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) and syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) processes. The reaction mechanism remains elusive, because the short&#8208;lived ethenone ketene and its derivatives are difficult to detect, which is further complicated by the low expected ketene concentration. We report on the experimental detection of methylketene (CH3&#8722;CH=C=O) formed by the methylation of ketene on HZSM&#8208;5 via operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy. Ketene is produced in situ from methyl acetate. The observation of methylketene as the ethylene precursor evidences a computationally predicted ketene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene route proceeding via a methylketene intermediate followed by decarbonylation.

         <title>Rapid Access to Diverse Multicomponent Hierarchical Nanostructures from Mixed&#8208;Graft Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were synthesized from three or four different types of macromonomers. The morphology of hierarchical nanostructures assembled from the prepared graft copolymers was readily diversified by varying the sequence, number, and molar ratio of the side chains.







Abstract
Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were prepared through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.

&lt;p&gt;Mixed-graft block copolymers containing sequence-defined side chains were synthesized from three or four different types of macromonomers. The morphology of hierarchical nanostructures assembled from the prepared graft copolymers was readily diversified by varying the sequence, number, and molar ratio of the side chains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity-oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed-graft block copolymers containing sequence-defined side chains were prepared through ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Reagents for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring members of the thiopurine methyltransferase family have been found to accept synthetic methyl sulfates or methyl sulfonates as methyl donors for the stereoselective methylation of S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine to form S&#8208;adenosylmethionine. This activity can be used for co&#8208;substrate regeneration in methyltransferase biocatalysis.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage methylation is a key technology in the development of pharmaceutical compounds. Methyltransferase biocatalysis may provide powerful options to insert methyl groups into complex molecules with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. The challenge of a large&#8208;scale application of methyltransferases is their dependence on S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a stoichiometric, and thus exceedingly expensive co&#8208;substrate. As a solution to this problem, we and others have explored the use of methyl halides as reagents for the in situ regeneration of SAM. However, the need to handle volatile electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI), may also hamper applications at scale. As a more practical solution, we have now developed an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process for the regeneration of SAM with methyl toluene sulfonate. Herein, we describe enzymes from the thiopurine methyltransferase family that accept sulfate&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;based methyl donors to convert S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine into SAM with efficiencies that rival MeI&#8208;based reactions.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Directed Reversal of 13C NMR Chemical Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding behavior of carbonyl carbon in sulfur and selenium substituted H&#8208;bonded amides. Solution phase NMR spectroscopy corroborated with various computational studies explains the physical origin of such unusual behavior.







Abstract
The deshielding or downfield 13C NMR chemical shift of amide carbonyl carbon upon H&#8208;bonding is a widely observed phenomenon. This downfield shift is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler for H&#8208;bonding. However, the very first observation of an upfield 13C NMR of thiocarbonyl carbon in thioamides upon H&#8208;bonding encouraged us to explore the physical origin of the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding. Careful NMR analysis shows that sulfur and selenium&#8208;centered H&#8208;bonds (S/SeCHBs) induce a shielding effect on the 13CC=S(Se) while changing from amides to thioamides or selenoamides. In addition, natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis shows that the &#963;11 and &#963;22 components of the isotropic shielding tensor (&#963;) have a crucial role in this unusual shielding.

We generated bench&#8208;top stable fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes and their application to the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes via the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported. To demonstrate their synthetic utility, the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes were transformed to fluoroalkene derivatives and all&#8208;carbon substituted alkenes.







Abstract
Reported herein is the efficient synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes by the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction of ketones and aldehydes with bench&#8208;top stable halo&#8208;diborylmethanes. The substrate scope is broad and the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction proceeds from a diverse range of ketones and aldehydes including biologically relevant molecules with fluoro&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes, providing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes in good yields with high stereoselectivity. The utilities of the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes are highlighted by further modifications to afford fluoroalkene derivatives or all&#8208;carbon substituted alkene.

Complexes formed between aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) acceptors and arylamine donors showed through&#8208;space charge transfer as well as a &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interaction between the acceptor and the donor. Owing to these properties, the complexes served as far&#8208;red fluorescent nanoprobes with two&#8208;photon excitation. The probe was applied to in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.







Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to the generation of fluorescent probes by synthetic approaches. In this study, we developed a facile strategy to construct far&#8208;red fluorescent probes based on through&#8208;space charge transfer within complexes of acceptors and donors and their &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interactions. Owing to their rare two&#8208;photon excitation property, the complexes could be used for in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Antimony&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antitumor Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel soluble and water&#8208;stable giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb&#8208;rich POM can exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor and anti&#8208;metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.







Abstract
Herein, a giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb21Tb7W56} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb&#8208;rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water&#8208;stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb&#8208;rich POM exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53&#8208;dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb&#8208;rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo.

     alt="A Water-Soluble Antimony-Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad-Spectrum Antitumor Activities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel soluble and water-stable giant Sb-rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb-rich POM can exhibit broad-spectrum antitumor and anti-metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a giant Sb-rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb-rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water-stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb-rich POM exhibits broad-spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53-dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb-rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo. This work demonstrates that Sb-rich POMs are promising candidates for the development of new anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Based on Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole with an Efficient Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the multiple&#8208;resonance ability of the indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit with boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons has led to compounds that show efficient green emission (CIE: 0.21, 0.71) and efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). OLEDs incorporating these multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials show a pure narrowband green emission (CIE: 0.22, 0.71) and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.2&#8201;%







Abstract
Herein, we report two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (VTCzBN and TCz&#8208;VTCzBN) based on indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit and boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons, whose emissions peaking at 496 and 521&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 34 and 29&#8197;nm, respectively. Meanwhile, fast rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing of above 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 are obtained due to small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and large spin&#8208;orbital coupling values. Notably, planar molecular structures along the transition dipole moment direction endow them with high horizontal emitting dipole ratios of up to 94&#8201;%. Consequently, the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show the maximum external quantum efficiencies of 31.7&#8201;% and 32.2&#8201;%, respectively. Particularly, OLED with TCz&#8208;VTCzBN display ultra&#8208;pure green emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinates of (0.22, 0.71), consistent with the green display standard of the National Television System Committee.

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

We report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to synthesize monolithic single atom electrodes. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution and nitrate reduction performances. The scalability and bifunctionality of Ru single atom electrode highlight its great potential of electrochemical applications.







Abstract
Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2&#215;2&#8197;cm to 25&#215;15&#8197;cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Simultaneous and Spontaneous Oxidation and Reduction in Microdroplets by the Water Radical Cation/Anion Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous oxidation and reduction of phosphonate occur simultaneously in microdroplets. The key active species are the endogenous water radical cation and anion derived from water molecules and present at the droplet surface.







Abstract
Microdroplets show unique chemistry, especially in their intrinsic redox properties, and to this we here add a case of simultaneous and spontaneous oxidation and reduction. We report the concurrent conversions of several phosphonates to phosphonic acids by reduction (R&#8722;P &#8594; H&#8722;P) and to pentavalent phosphoric acids by oxidation. The experimental results suggest that the active reagent is the water radical cation/anion pair. The water radical cation is observed directly as the ionized water dimer while the water radical anion is only seen indirectly though the spontaneous reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. The coexistence of oxidative and reductive species in turn supports the proposal of a double&#8208;layer structure at the microdroplet surface, where the water radical cation and radical anion are separated and accumulated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Carboxylation of Organic Halides in the Presence of Catalytic Amounts of an Organomediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and metal&#8208;free method for the electroreductive carboxylation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds has been developed to obtain carboxylated compounds in the presence of catalytic amounts of naphthalene as a mediator. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, and is shown to be a powerful approach for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X=Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylations of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds via single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral molecules are transported along a pre&#8208;defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl&#8208;rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction&#8208;diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non&#8208;polar molecule pyrene.







Abstract
Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Neutral molecules are transported along a pre-defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl-rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction-diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non-polar molecule pyrene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60-fold within 4&#8197;hours.

As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Poor Alkenes and Dienes Enabled by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydride Addition/Protonolysis Mechanism

Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos in methanol catalyzes the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor dienes and related substrates at low metal loadings via a hydride addition/Rh&#8208;enolate protonation pathway.







Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes is a well&#8208;developed technology used on lab scale as well as on large scales in the chemical industry. Site&#8208; and chemoselective mono&#8208;hydrogenations of polarized conjugated dienes remain challenging. Instead, stoichiometric main&#8208;group hydrides are used rather than H2. As part of an effort to develop a scalable route to prepare geranylacetone, we discovered that Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos based catalysts enable the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes, enones, and other polyunsaturated substrates. D&#8208;labeling and DFT studies support a mechanism where a nucleophilic RhI&#8208;hydride selectively adds to electron&#8208;poor alkenes and the resulting Rh&#8208;enolate undergoes subsequent inner&#8208;sphere protonation by alcohol solvent. The finding that (Ln)Rh(H)(CO) type catalysts can enable selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes provides a valuable tool in the design of related chemoselective hydrogenation processes.

         <title>Atropopeptides are a Novel Family of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Peptides with a Complex Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropopeptides are a family of ribosomally synthesized and postranslationally modified peptides with an unusual complex molecular shape. A single cytochrome P450 is sufficient for the atropospecific introduction of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. A two&#8208;step maturation process yields hexa&#8208; and pentapeptide products that act as signaling metabolites and show proliferative and pro&#8208;migratory properties in endothelial cell cultures.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules are known to feature complex three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are essential for their function. Among natural products, ambiguous molecular shapes are a rare phenomenon. The hexapeptide tryptorubin A can adopt one of two unusual atropisomeric configurations. Initially hypothesized to be a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, we show that tryptorubin A is the first characterized member of a new family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that we named atropopeptides. The sole modifying enzyme encoded in the gene cluster, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the atropospecific formation of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The characterization of two additional atropopeptide biosynthetic pathways revealed a two&#8208;step maturation process. Atropopeptides promote pro&#8208;angiogenic cell functions as indicated by an increase in endothelial cell proliferation and undirected migration. Our study expands the biochemical space of RiPP&#8208;modifying enzymes and paves the way towards the chemoenzymatic utilization of atropopeptide&#8208;modifying P450s.

         <title>Fluorinated Copolypeptide&#8208;Stabilized Microbubbles with Maleimide&#8208;Decorated Surfaces as Long&#8208;Term Ultrasound Contrast Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic fluorinated copolypeptides are used to stabilize perfluorocarbon&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) with the formation of highly stable ultrasound (US) contrast agents. Moreover, the US signals can be remarkably enhanced by the in situ reaction of peripheral maleimide moieties with plasma proteins without compromising the stability of MBs, outperforming commercially available SonoVueTM MBs in in vivo US imaging applications.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) have been clinically used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, it remains a great challenge to resolve the dilemma of stability and contrast enhancement of MBs. Herein, amphiphilic copolypeptides bearing fluorinated blocks are synthesized to stabilize perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;filled MBs, exhibiting unique stability under both long&#8208;term storage and US imaging conditions. The fluorinated inner layer reduces the internal Laplace pressure and greatly improves the stability of MBs, which can be further reinforced by crosslinking of the dipropargyl&#8208;containing middle blocks. To overcome the suppressed nonlinear oscillation of polymer shells, maleimide groups are introduced onto the surface of MBs, enabling in situ reaction with plasma proteins to enhance second harmonic signals without compromising the stability of MBs, conferring better US imaging performance than that of SonoVueTM MBs.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented under mild conditions. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and acidic methylene with protons, are good precursors for three&#8208;membered ring formation, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered cyclic structures are widely existing in natural products and serve as enabling intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the efficient and straightforward access to such structures with diversity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes synthesis using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented. This metal&#8208;free protocol features the direct aziridination and cyclopropanation with unprotected XH2. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and methylene with acidic protons, are good precursors, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.

         <title>Less is More: A Shortcut for Anionocages Design Based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;Monourea Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent hydrogen bonding motif of phosphotyrosine residues of proteins has inspired an advanced strategy for the design of a new type of anionocage based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, which features more simple synthesis and more potential of functionalization than the former strategy based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, providing a proof of the design concept &#8220;Less is More&#8221;.







Abstract
Anionocages have been developed as a unique family of hydrogen bonded cages. However, strategies for constructing anionocages are mainly limited to that based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, neither the ligands nor the anions lack the simplicity and diversity of the maturely developed analogues based on metal coordination (i.e. metallocage). We report herein a more simple strategy for anionocages design based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, utilizing monourea rather than bisurea as the hydrogen binding donor, and RPO32&#8722; rather than PO43&#8722; as the acceptor. Two fluorescent, quadruple helicate anionocages were constructed by a bis&#8208;monourea ligand, and dianions PhOPO32&#8722; (H1) or HOPO32&#8722; (H1A), respectively, which were capable of encapsulating a series of cation guests. As revealed by molecular modeling, H1 features remarkable guest&#8208;adaptive cavity breathing without change of the quadruple helicate topology, which allowed the encapsulation of different sized guests in an &#8220;induced fit&#8221; manner.

         <title>SpeedMixing: Rapid Tribochemical Synthesis and Discovery of Pharmaceutical Cocrystals without Milling or Grinding Media
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, for rapid and scalable synthesis and discovery of pharmaceutical cocrystals without using either bulk solvents or milling media is reported. SpeedMixing permits selective synthesis of cocrystal polymorphs, stoichiomorphs and revealed the first solvate of the archetypal pharmaceutical cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, that has remained unknown despite 20&#8197;years of research and screening.







Abstract
We present SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, as an approach for fast mechanosynthesis and discovery of model pharmaceutical cocrystals through rapid spinning in the absence of bulk solvents and milling/grinding media. Syntheses of pharmaceutical cocrystals based on the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) carbamazepine, dihydrocarbamazepine, and nicotinamide demonstrate SpeedMixing as a method for rapid, scalable, as well as controllable and selective synthesis of cocrystals, cocrystal polymorphs and stoichiomorphs, including the discovery of an unexpected methanol solvate of the archetypal cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, which has eluded extensive screens over 20&#8197;years.

         <title>Synthesis of Square Planar Cu4 Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polynuclear reaction sites catalyze some of the most challenging transformations in chemistry. Programmatic assembly of atomically&#8208;precise cluster compounds is challenging. Here we describe the synthesis of supramolecular ligands designed to nucleate well&#8208;defined square planar tetranuclear copper clusters, establishing metal&#8208;metal interactions capable of delocalizing oxidation stress across the cluster.







Abstract
Template&#8208;assisted synthesis of well&#8208;defined polynuclear clusters remains a challenge for [M4] square planar topologies. Herein, we present a tetraamine scaffold RL(NH2)4, where L is a rigidified resorcin[4]arene, to direct the formation of C4&#8208;symmetric RL(NH)4Cu4 clusters with Cu&#8722;Cu distances around 2.7&#8197;&#197;, suggesting metal&#8208;metal direct interactions are operative since the sum of copper's van der Waals radii is 2.8&#8197;&#197;. DFT calculations display HOMO to HOMO&#8208;3 residing all within a 0.1&#8197;eV gap. These four orbitals display significant electron density contribution from the Cu centers suggesting a delocalized electronic structure. The one&#8208;electron oxidized [Cu4]+ species was probed by variable temperature X&#8208;band continuous wave&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance (CW&#8208;EPR), which displays a multiline spectrum at room temperature. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for [M4] clusters and a new platform to investigate activation of small molecules.
