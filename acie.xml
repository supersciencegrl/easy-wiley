         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Addition Reactions of Alkylarenes to Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of alkylarenes as nucleophile precursors in benzylic addition is challenging because the benzylic hydrogen atoms of these compounds are inert to deprotonation. Herein, we report Rh&#8208;catalyzed benzylic addition of alkylarenes to Michael acceptors for the formation of C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds. The catalyst is proposed to activate the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating deprotonation of the unactivated benzylic C&#8211;H bond and addition of the resulting carbanion to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated double bond in the absence of bases. Notably, this byproduct&#8208;free method provides an access to all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through the development of ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we presented an unprecedented synergic catalytic protocol for asymmetric construction of fluorinated  N  &#8208;bridged [3.2.1] cyclic members of tropane family via bifunctional phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization process. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups are compatible with this protocol, providing targeted compounds bearing seven&#8208;membered ring and four contiguous stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The gram&#8208;scale preparations, facile elaborations and preliminary biological activities of the products demonstrated the applicable potential. Moreover, both experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the cyclization proceeded via an ingenious &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model with multiple weak&#8208;bond cooperative activations. Insights gained from our studies are expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of challenging chiral heterocyclic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of 9&#8208;Phenanthrols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective hydrogenation of arenols to corresponding chiral cyclic alcohols remains a challenge because of their aromaticity and the difficulty in controlling the regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. In this work, the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of 9&#8208;phenanthrols has been successfully realized under mild conditions via trapping the unstable keto tautomers.The method provides a facile access to a range of chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthren&#8208;9&#8208;ols with up to 98% yield and &gt;99%  ee  . The hydrogenation pathway includes base&#8208;promoted tautomerization of 9&#8208;phenanthrols and Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the  in situ  generated unstable keto tautomers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;membered rings (3&#8208;rings) are an important structural motif in zeolite chemistry, but their formation remains serendipitous in reticular chemistry when designing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Herein, we report a design principle for constructing four new ZIFs, termed ZIF&#8208;1001 to &#8208;1004, from tetrahedral ZnII  centers (T), benzotriazolate (bTZ), and different functionalized benzimidazolates (RbIM) that adopt a new zeolite NPO&#8208;type topology built from 3&#8208;rings. Two factors were critical for this discovery: (i) incorporating the bTZ linker within the structures formed 3&#8208;rings due to a &#8736;(T&#8211;bTZ&#8211;T) angle of 120&#8208;130&#176; reminiscent of the &#8736;(Ge&#8211;O&#8211;Ge) angle (130&#176;) observed in germanate zeolite&#8208;type structures having 3&#8208;rings; and (ii) RbIM guided the coordination chemistry of bTZ to bind preferentially in an imidazolate&#8208;type mode. This series&#8217; ability to selectively capture CO  2  from high&#8208;humidity flue gas and trap ethane from tail gas during shale gas extraction was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Electrostatically Templated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a switchable templated polymerization system where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated by solution pH and/or ionic strength. The responsiveness to these cues is incorporated through a dendritic polyamidoamine&#8208;based template of which the charge density depends on pH. The dendrimers act as a template for the polymerization of an oppositely charged monomer, namely sodium styrene sulfonate. We show that the rate of polymerization and maximum achievable monomer conversion are directly related to the charge density of the template, and hence the environmental pH. The polymerization could effectively be switched &#8216;ON&#8217; and &#8216;OFF&#8217; on demand, by cycling between acidic and alkaline reaction environments. These findings break ground for a novel concept, namely harnessing co&#8208;assembly of a template and growing polymer chains with tunable association strength to create and control coupled polymerization and self&#8208;assembly pathways of (charged) macromolecular building blocks.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report a switchable templated polymerization system where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated by solution pH and/or ionic strength. The responsiveness to these cues is incorporated through a dendritic polyamidoamine-based template of which the charge density depends on pH. The dendrimers act as a template for the polymerization of an oppositely charged monomer, namely sodium styrene sulfonate. We show that the rate of polymerization and maximum achievable monomer conversion are directly related to the charge density of the template, and hence the environmental pH. The polymerization could effectively be switched &#8216;ON&#8217; and &#8216;OFF&#8217; on demand, by cycling between acidic and alkaline reaction environments. These findings break ground for a novel concept, namely harnessing co-assembly of a template and growing polymer chains with tunable association strength to create and control coupled polymerization and self-assembly pathways of (charged) macromolecular building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diversification of Aryl Sulfonyl Compounds through Ligand Controlled meta&#8208; and para&#8208;C&#8208;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides are of great importance in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although ortho  &#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of aryl sulfonyl compounds has been extensively explored, the functionalization of remote meta&#8208;  and para  &#8208;C&#8208;H bonds is very rare. Herein, we report a tunable meta&#8208;  and para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H borylation of aryl sulfonyl compounds enabled by computationally designed ligands and iridium catalyst. This method is capable of accommodating a broad range of substrates under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale preparation can be achieved with iridium catalyst loading as low as 0.1 mol%. As the introduced boronate group can be easily converted into many other groups, our method provides a general solution to installing functional groups at either meta  &#8208; or para  &#8208;position of aryl sulfones and aryl sulfonamides with good to excellent selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving over 18% Efficiency Organic Solar Cell Enabled by a ZnO&#8208;Based Hybrid Electron Transport Layer with an Operational Lifetime up to 5 Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although organic solar cells (OSCs) have delivered impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 19%, most of them demonstrated rather limited stability. So far, there are hardly any effective and universal strategies to improve stability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs. Herein, we developed a hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted OSCs using ZnO and a new modifying agent (NMA), and significantly improved stability and PCEs for all the tested devices. In particular, when applied in D18:N3 system, its inverted OSC exhibits so far the highest PCE (18.20%) among inverted single&#8208;junction OSCs, demonstrating an extrapolated T80 lifetime of 7572 h (equivalent to 5 years under outdoor exposure). This is the first report with T80 over 5000 h among OSCs with over 18% PCEs. Furthermore, a high PCE of 16.12% can be realized even in large&#8208;area device (1 cm2). This hybrid ETL strategy provide a strong stimulus for highly prospective commercialization of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Ti t2g Orbit&#8208;occupancy in Cu/TiO2 Composite for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of composites plays a critical role in photocatalytic conversion, whereas it is challenging to modulate orbit for an efficient catalyst. Herein, we regulated the t2g orbital occupancy state of Ti to realize efficient CO2 conversion via adjusting the amount of photo&#8208;deposited Cu in the Cu/TiO2 composite. For the optimal sample, considerable electrons transfer from Cu d orbit to Ti t2g orbit, proved by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The Raman spectra results also corroborates the electron enrichment on the Ti t2g orbit. Further theoretical calculations suggested that the orbital energy of Ti 3d orbit in TiO2 is declined, contributing to accepting Cu 3d electrons. As a result, the Cu/TiO2 composite exhibited the extremely high selectivity of 95.9 % for CO, and the productivity was 15.27 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is almost 6 times that of the original TiO2. Our work provides a strategy for designing efficient photocatalysis in the perspective of orbital regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of All&#8208;Carbon Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with heteroarenes, homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis due to the strong aromaticity and difficult enantioselective control. Herein, we reported the rhodium/diphosphine catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon aromatic rings, affording a series of axially chiral cyclic compounds with high enantioselectivity through desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. In addition, the central&#8208;chiral cyclic compounds were also obtained by asymmetric hydrogenation of phenanthrenes bearing a directing group. The key to success is the introduction of chiral diphosphine ligands with steric hindrance and strong electron&#8208;donating property. The axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be obtained by simple conversion of the hydrogenation products bearing the phosphine atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;regulated Pathway&#8208;dependent Chirality Control of Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imparting chirality affords additive values, functions and responsiveness in molecular systems including nanoscale materials. Here, we report pathway dependent chirality control in silver nanoclusters (NCs). The use of enantiomeric ligand, &#945;&#8208;dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), for the synthesis of Ag NCs leads to the preferential formation of one&#8208;handed chiral Ag29(DHLA)12  NCs with intrinsic chirality in the exterior shell composed of a silver&#8208;dithiolate framework. Small Lewis base molecules such as pyridine bind to silver atoms in the shell of NC as a guest. The guest binding reverses the relative stability between the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed NCs upon a steric interaction with the chiral ligand DHLA in the exterior shell in a kinetic manner, leading to unprecedented chirality inversion in the synthesis of NCs. This mechanism is further extended to the self&#8208;regulation or self&#8208;replication of chirality through interNC interactions dependent on the concentration in the synthesis of NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transparent and Colorless Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Sensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of transparent solar cells extends the applications of photovoltaics by offering the opportunity to substitute the gigantic surface coverage of windows by solar panels to produce electricity. In this contribution, we report a new family of NIR&#8208;sensitizers based on pyrrolopyrrole cyanine dyes, particularly efficient for the development of fully transparent and colorless dye sensitized solar cells since a record efficiency of 2.5% was achieved with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 76% and a color rending index (CRI) of 93.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic&#8208;Mitochondrial&#8208;ROS&#8208;Activated In Situ Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environment&#8208;responsive in&#8208;situ synthesis of molecular fluorescent dyes has been a very challenging topic. Herein, we developed a photoextension strategy to make trimethine cyanines with decent conversion efficiency (up to 81%) using 1&#8208;butyl 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl 3  H  &#8208;indole derivatives as the sole precursors, and demonstrated a free radical&#8208;participating mechanism. In the inducer&#8208;extension strategy, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were able to mediate similar reaction with no assistance of light. Additionally, we explored a Mito&#8208;extension strategy to in situ synthesize trimethine cyanines in the living cells. The cellular ROS&#8208;dependence provided a foundation for cancer cell&#8208;preferential cyanine expression. Finally, we applied an iodized precursor as an intrinsic ROS&#8208;activated theranostic agent that integrated mitochondria&#8208;targeted cyanine synthesis, cell imaging and phototherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Production of L&#8208;homophenylalanine by&#160; Enzymatic&#8211;Chemical Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;Homophenylalanine (L&#8208;HPA) is a vital building block for the synthesis of numerous chiral drugs. However, the high cost of starting materials limits the industrial production of L&#8208;HPA. In this study, an enzymatic&#8208;spontaneous chemical cascade route for L&#8208;HPA production was designed based on retrosynthetic analysis. This route, using simple benzaldehyde and pyruvate as starting materials, is extremely cost&#8208;effective. The enzymes were screened and further assembled in  E.coli, and&#160;TipheDH was identified as the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme. Therefore,  TipheDH was engineered to improve its specific activity (by 82%) and expression level (by 254%), thus generating the best strain (W14). W14 exhibited the optimum enzyme activity ratio (1.7:1.1:1:1.8) and demonstrated production of 100.9 g/L of L&#8208;HPA (with 94% conversion, &gt;99% ee) in a 5&#8208;L reactor. This route effectively exploits the power of cascades and offers insight into avenues for synthesizing other valuable chemicals from inexpensive building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Tile Self&#8208;Assembly Guided by Base Excision Repair Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here the use of DNA repair enzymes to control the assembly of DNA&#8208;based structures. To do so, we employed uracil&#8208;DNA glycosylase (UDG) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), two enzymes involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We designed two responsive nucleic acid modules containing mutated bases (deoxyuridine or 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208; dihydroguanine recognized by UDG and Fpg, respectively) that, upon the enzyme repair activity, release a nucleic acid strand that induces the self&#8208;assembly of DNA tiles into tubular structures. The approach is programmable, specific and orthogonal and the two responsive modules can be used in the same solution without crosstalk. This allows to assemble structures formed by two different tiles in which tiles distribution can be accurately predicted as a function of the relative activity of each enzyme. Finally, we show that BER&#8208;enzymes inhibitors can also be used to control DNA&#8208;tile assembly in a specific and concentration&#8208;dependent manner .</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed MoOx on Rhodium Metallene Boosts Electrocatalyzed Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accelerating the slow water dissociation kinetics is key to boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Here we report synthesis of atomically dispersed MoO  x  species anchored on Rh metallene using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The resulting structures expose the oxide&#8208;metal interfaces to the maximum extent. This leads to a MoO  x  &#8208;Rh catalyst with ultrahigh alkaline HER activity. We obtain a mass activity of 2.32 A mg  Rh  &#8208;1  at an overpotential of 50 mV, which is 11.8 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and surpasses the previously reported Rh&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate that the interface between MoO  x  and Rh is the active center for alkaline HER. The MoO  x  sites preferentially adsorb and dissociate water molecules and adjacent Rh sites adsorb the generated atomic hydrogen for efficient H  2  evolution. Our findings illustrate the potential of atomic interface engineering strategies in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Shell Engineering of a Au28 Nanocluster Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboranethiolate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28&#8208;S was fabricated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S has an identical metal core to the reported Au28&#8208;C but different peripheral ligands. This ligand&#8208;shell tailoring led to obvious differences in their electronic structures and optical properties. Compared to Au28&#8208;C, Au28&#8208;S shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly change their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal cores but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au28(C2B10H11S)12(tht)4Cl4 (Au28&#8208;S), was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S adopts an identical Au28 metal framework to that of the reported alkynyl&#8208;protected Au28&#8208;C. The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore, Au28&#8208;S shows better catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations identified the active sites and shed light on the catalytic mechanism to elucidate the different catalytic performances. This work provides an ideal platform to study the protective layer&#8208;activity relationship of gold NCs, and may also provide guidance in the design of metal NC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) have attracted broad interest due to their intriguing features and functions. Host&#8208;guest interactions often impart tunable physicochemical properties, reversible hierarchical organization, and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to SPs for diverse biomedical applications. Characterized by the strong yet dynamic interactions with guest molecules, cucurbit[  n  ]uril (CB[  n  ]) has shown great potential as an important building block of various functional polymers for biomedical applications. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize the most recent examples of the design, fabrication, and biomedical applications of CB[  n  ]&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (CSPs), which are categorized into non&#8208;covalent and covalent CSPs according to the interactions between CB[  n  ] and polymer backbones. The design principles of CSPs and their unique advantages for the biomedical applications, as well as the developmental trends and future perspectives of this cross&#8208;disciplinary area are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;in&#8208;One Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Long&#8208;Lived Luminescent Systems Based on Pyrene&#8208;Doped Amorphous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived luminescent systems are developed based on pyrene&#8208;doped polymers, where the phosphorescence exhibits radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics at the same time.







Abstract
Materials exhibiting ultralong luminescent lifetime show promising applications in the fields of information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;cost and general strategy to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on pyrene chromophores doped into polymer matrices. The UOP of the resulted systems presents radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics. The UOP color can be turned from blue to red by changing the excitation wavelength or the concentration of chromophores. Experimental results prove that these characteristics are attributed to the consumption of triplet oxygen and the different aggregation states of chromophores in the polymer matrices. Finally, we demonstrate that these systems could be applied for multilevel information encryption. This work would promote further development of multi&#8208;responsive long&#8208;lived luminescent materials.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic synthetic strategy has resulted in a two&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;ulodione&#8197;A and the prediction of two potential natural products, (&#177;)&#8208;ulodiones&#8197;C and D. This work was guided by computational investigations into the selectivity of a proposed biosynthetic Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization, which was then utilized in the chemical synthesis.

         <title>Imide&#8208;Functionalized Fluorenone and Its Cyanated Derivative Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Thin&#8208;Film Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imide&#8208;functionalization of fluorenone and its cyanated derivative afforded new acceptors FOI and FCNI, respectively, featuring excellent solubility, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO, which enabled the resulting polymers with unique n&#8208;type transport character in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. The design strategy and synthetic routes to FOI and FCNI are highly informative for the further development of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties. By meticulously installing an imide group onto fluorene and its cyanated derivative, we report here two very electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, imide&#8208;functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI), both featuring a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level down to &#8722;4.05&#8197;eV and highly coplanar framework, endowing them ideal units for constructing n&#8208;type polymers. Thus, a series of polymers are built from them, exhibiting unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a highest electron mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Hence, FOI and FCNI offer a remarkable platform for accessing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and the imide functionalization of appropriate (hetero)arenes is a powerful strategy for developing polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMOs for n&#8208;type organic electronics.

         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and enantioselective, intermolecular vicinal fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes was achieved by enantioselective II/IIII catalysis. The transient iodonium intermediate is intercepted with nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile. In situ Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89&#8201;% yield). Crystallographic analyses of the &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products show highly preorganized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic gauche effect.







Abstract
The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective, intermolecular vicinal fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes has been achieved by enantioselective II/IIII catalysis. Leveraging C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol&#8208;based aryl iodide catalysts, it has been possible to intercept the transient iodonium intermediate using simple nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile. In situ Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89&#8201;% yield, e.r. 93&#8201;:&#8201;7). This main group catalysis paradigm inverts the intrinsic regioselectivity of the uncatalyzed process, thereby providing facile access to tertiary, benzylic stereocenters bearing both CF3 and F groups. Privileged phenethylamine pharmacophores can be generated in which there is complete local partial charge inversion (CF3&#948;&#8722;/F&#948;&#8722; versus CH3&#948;+/H&#948;+). Crystallographic analyses of representative &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products reveal highly pre&#8208;organized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic gauche effect.

         <title>Unveiling the Proton&#8208;Feeding Effect in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doping in the second coordination shell of FeN4 induces the increased CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance relative to pristine FeN4. The proton&#8208;feeding effect after sulfur doping is demonstrated to promote protonation of *CO2 to *COOH, and thus CO2RR performances, through kinetic analysis, in situ characterization and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is considered a powerful strategy to promote the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the origin of enhanced catalytic activity is still elusive. Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton&#8208;feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in the second&#8208;shell of FeN4 (Fe1&#8722;NSC) was verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe1&#8722;NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur&#8208;free FeN4 and most reported Fe&#8208;based SACs, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6&#8201;% and turnover frequency of 1197&#8197;h&#8722;1. Kinetic analysis and in situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient protons for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of the CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.

         <title>Electrostatic Secondary&#8208;Sphere Interactions That Facilitate Rapid and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere interactions provide precise and systematic control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity and activity in a Fe&#8208;porphyrin based MOF. Specifically, we show that MOFs allow the incorporation of molecular catalysts and positively&#8208;charged ligands one next to the other, in a manner which promotes catalysis by stabilization of reactive intermediates during electrochemical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms for heterogeneous tethering of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Yet, to further understand electrocatalytic MOF systems, one also needs to consider their capability to fine&#8208;tune the immediate chemical environment of the active site, and thus affect its overall catalytic operation. Here, we show that electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities enable substantial improvement of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity and selectivity. In situ Raman analysis reveal that immobilization of pendent positively&#8208;charged groups adjacent to MOF&#8208;residing Fe&#8208;porphyrin catalysts, stabilize weakly&#8208;bound CO intermediates, allowing their rapid release as catalytic products. Also, by varying the electrolyte's ionic strength, systematic regulation of electrostatic field magnitude was achieved, resulting in essentially 100&#8201;% CO selectivity. Thus, this concept provides a sensitive molecular&#8208;handle that adjust heterogeneous electrocatalysis on demand.

         <title>High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries using a Urea&#8208;based Electrolyte&#160;with Kinetically Favorable One&#8208;electron Li2O2 Oxidation Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glymes are the most widely used electrolyte solvents in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) due to their relatively high stability. However, their associated LOBs have long been plagued by large charge overpotential, which is closely related to the sluggish two&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation mechanism. Here, we report a new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) for LOBs with high performance and an alternative mechanism, where a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can happen in the urea electrolyte system, thus leading to a much lower charge overpotential (~0.51 V) compared to the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (~1.27 V). Besides, TMU also exhibits good stability since it does not contain any alpha&#8208;hydrogen atoms that are vulnerable to be attacked by superoxide species, thus suppressing the hydrogen abstraction side reactions. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs can stably work for more than 135 cycles, which is four times that of the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (~28 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Generation of Isothiouronyl Radical Cations: A New Platform in Covalent Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothiouronyl radical cations have been identified as a new class of radical catalysts for the covalent activation of vinylcyclopropanes. Their generation by photoredox catalysis from N,N,N,N&#8208;tetrasubstituted thioureas provides a modular, versatile and practical platform to achieve covalent radical catalysis.







Abstract
Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation of alkenes. However, important limitations in terms of structural diversity and handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur&#8208;centered radicals to achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system were finally evaluated in a (3+2)&#8208;radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and olefins.

         <dc:description>An unprecedented hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols and racemic ketimine esters enabled by Cu/Ru relay catalysis has been developed via merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The current method enables the efficient preparation of highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxyesters bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with high levels of diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emeriones, three highly oxidized and densely functionalized polyketides, were synthesized from two enantioenriched fragments in a Stille&#8208;8&#960;/6&#960; sequence, followed by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and chemoselective oxidations. This work enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C.







Abstract
We report asymmetric bioinspired total syntheses of the fungal metabolites emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C via stereoselective oxidations of two bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene diastereomers. The central bicyclic scaffolds are prepared in an 8&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization cascade of a stereodefined pentaene, which contains the fully assembled side chains of the emeriones. The anti&#8208;aldol side chain is made using a Paterson&#8208;aldol addition, and the epoxide of the dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane side chain via ring&#8208;closure onto an oxidized acetal. Our work has enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C, and resulted in the synthesis of a &#8220;missing&#8221; family member, which we call emerione&#8197;D. DFT calculations identified two methyl groups that govern torquoselectivity in the 8&#960;/6&#960; cascade.

&lt;p&gt;The emeriones, three highly oxidized and densely functionalized polyketides, were synthesized from two enantioenriched fragments in a Stille-8&#960;/6&#960; sequence, followed by late-stage stereo- and chemoselective oxidations. This work enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C.

A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation involves an oxidative addition/reductive elimination process, while aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation is mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. DFT calculations showed that steric hindrance is responsible for the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosides are popular basic skeletons in biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed highly stereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation is described. A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by this method. The strategy showed good substrate scope, and various N&#8208;heterocyclic directing groups were compatible with the reaction system. A mechanistic study suggested that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation might involve oxidative addition/reduction elimination, whereas aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation was mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. Density functional theory calculations also showed that the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation was due to steric hindrance.

         <title>Borylation Directed Borylation of Indoles Using Pyrazabole Electrophiles: A One&#8208;Pot Route to C7&#8208;Borylated&#8208;Indolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophiles based on pyrazabole are simple to access reagents for the double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) borylation of N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles/indolines. Due to the robust B2N4 core of pyrazaboles and a B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation of ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, the first borylation directs the second to a proximal C&#8722;H. For N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles, C7&#8208;borylation occurs alongside reduction resulting, post work&#8208;up, in the one&#8208;pot formation of C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines without requiring installation of a directing group.







Abstract
Pyrazabole (1) is a readily accessible diboron compound that can be transformed into ditopic electrophiles. In 1 (and derivatives), the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation is ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, appropriate for one boron centre bonding to N and one to the C7 of indoles and indolines. This suitable B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation enables double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) functionalisation of indoles and indolines. Specifically, the activation of 1 with HNTf2 generates an electrophile that transforms N&#8722;H indoles and indolines into N/C7&#8208;diborylated indolines, with N&#8722;H borylation directing subsequent C7&#8722;H borylation. Indole reduction to indoline occurs before C&#8722;H borylation and our studies indicate this proceeds via hydroboration&#8212;C3&#8208;protodeboronation to produce an intermediate that then undergoes C7 borylation. The borylated products can be converted in situ into C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;indolines. Overall, this represents a transient directed C&#8722;H borylation to form useful C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines.

         <title>Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Cation Exchange
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative exchange of metal cations has resulted in a variety of crystals having different optical and magnetic properties but with retention of the crystal shape. Crystals isolated during the exchange exhibited higher concentrations of the incoming metal cations at the hexagonal basal faces, which suggests that the nanochannels are mediating the process.







Abstract
We show that metal&#8211;organic frameworks, based on tetrahedral pyridyl ligands, can be used as a morphological and structural template to form a series of isostructural crystals having different metal ions and properties. An iterative crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal conversion has been demonstrated by consecutive cation exchanges. The primary manganese&#8208;based crystals are characterized by an uncommon space group (P622). The packing includes chiral channels that can mediate the cation exchange, as indicated by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy on microtome&#8208;sectioned crystals. The observed cation exchange is in excellent agreement with the Irving&#8211;Williams series (Mn&lt;Fe&lt;Co&lt;Ni&lt;&#8201;Cu&gt;Zn) associated with the relative stability of the resulting coordination nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the metal cation controls the optical and magnetic properties. The crystals maintain their morphology, allowing a quantitative comparison of their properties at both the ensemble and single&#8208;crystal level.

         <title>Alternative Benzoxazole Assembly Discovered in Anaerobic Bacteria Provides Access to Privileged Heterocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biosynthetic route to a medically relevant benzoxazole scaffold was discovered in anaerobic bacteria. Genome editing, heterologous expression, and biotransformation studies show that the pathway invokes specialized precursors, backbone assembly, and heterocyclization to form closoxazoles. The biocatalysts involved display synthetic utility, and prompted the genomics&#8208;driven identification of cryptic gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.







Abstract
Benzoxazole scaffolds feature prominently in diverse synthetic and natural product&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals. Our understanding of their bacterial biosynthesis is, however, limited to ortho&#8208;substituted heterocycles from actinomycetes. We report an overlooked biosynthetic pathway in anaerobic bacteria (typified in Clostridium cavendishii) that expands the benzoxazole chemical space to meta&#8208;substituted heterocycles and heralds a distribution beyond Actinobacteria. The first benzoxazoles from the anaerobic realm (closoxazole A and B) were elucidated by NMR and chemical synthesis. By genome editing in the native producer, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and systematic pathway dissection we show that closoxazole biosynthesis invokes an unprecedented precursor usage (3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate) and manner of assembly. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis of a tafamidis analogue. A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.

A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eu2P2S6: The First Rare&#8208;Earth Chalcogenophosphate Exhibiting Large Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response and High Laser&#8208;Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2P2S6 exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2. Eu2P2S6 is the first NLO&#8208;active rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based chalcogenophosphate.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenophosphates are receiving increasing interest, specifically as promising infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) candidates. Here, a rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphate Eu2P2S6 crystallizing in the monoclinic noncentrosymmetric space group Pn was synthesized using a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure features isolated [P2S6]4&#8722; dimer, and two types of EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. Eu2P2S6 exhibits a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2, representing the first rare&#8208;earth NLO chalcogenophosphate. The theoretical calculation result suggests that the SHG response is ascribed to the synergetic contribution of [P2S6]4&#8722; dimers and EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. This work provides not only a promising high&#8208;performance infrared NLO material, but also opens the avenue for exploring rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphates as potential IR NLO materials.

         <title>Reversible Insulator&#8211;Metal Transition by Chemical Doping and Dedoping of a Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical carrier doping of an x&#8208;LiPc molecular Mott insulator (Pc=phthalocyanine) induced an insulator&#8211;metal transition, and the obtained metallic x&#8208;LiPcI reverted to the pristine x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator through dedoping iodine. The advent of the reversible insulator&#8211;metal transition by doping and dedoping of the molecular Mott insulator could lead to a new class of strongly correlated materials.







Abstract
The chemical carrier doping of molecular Mott insulators has been poorly investigated to date due to its difficulty. In this study, iodine doping of a molecular Mott insulator, lithium phthalocyanine crystallized in the x&#8208;form (x&#8208;LiPc), was performed to obtain metallic x&#8208;LiPcI. Crystal structure analysis revealed that iodine atoms penetrated channels of x&#8208;LiPc and formed one&#8208;dimensional chains. The Raman spectroscopy of x&#8208;LiPcI indicated the existence of linear I5&#8722;, demonstrating a transition from a half&#8208;filled band of the Mott insulating state to a 2/5&#8208;filled band of the metallic state. Electrical resistivity measurements confirmed the metallic nature of x&#8208;LiPcI, whereas a thermally activated behavior was observed for pristine x&#8208;LiPc. Furthermore, the x&#8208;LiPc Mott insulator was reproduced by dedoping iodine from x&#8208;LiPcI, suggesting that the electronic state can be reversibly tuned between the Mott insulating and metallic states by chemical doping and dedoping.

         <title>Origin of Red&#8208;Shifted Phosphorescence from Triphenylamines: Triplet Excimer or Impurity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How much should triplet excimer phosphorescence shift in energy compared to that of the monomer? An original study on triphenylamine from more than 30&#8197;years ago showed a large shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is now debunked as new evidence suggests impurity phosphorescence interference. The purified aggregate phosphorescence shift is estimated to be &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TPA) was reported to exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence, where the red&#8208;shifted band was assigned as the excimeric phosphorescence with an energy shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (J. Phys. Chem. 1991, 95, 7189). Here we show that purified TPA (purity: &gt;99.97&#8201;%) shows a single phosphorescence band with a small energy shift of &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1 under the same experimental conditions. The new experimental results, along with theoretical calculations, suggest that the previously reported triplet excimer of TPA is probably not valid and is most likely due to an unidentified impurity. As&#8208;received TPA samples, however, do exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence bands, and the wavelength, relative intensity, and temperature dependence of the lower&#8208;energy phosphorescence band vary significantly depending on dopant structures. It was found that dopant phosphorescence could still become dominant even in dilute third&#8208;party solutions of the host at low temperature.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes with Carboranes: Facile Construction of a Library of Boron Cluster&#8208;Based AIE&#8208;Active Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes enables the construction of a library of boron cluster&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens. This work provides not only a general design principle for a new type of luminogens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize photo&#8208;functional boron cluster derivatives.







Abstract
The classical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens (AIEgens) usually include two&#8208;dimensional aromatic systems such as tetraphenylethenes, which are synthesized in several steps by using toxic additives. Here, we proposed a new molecular design strategy for the realization of AIE properties by combining three&#8208;dimensional aromatic boron clusters of carboranes with vinyl group(s). To obtain a library of the boron cluster&#8208;based AIEgens, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes is reported. This reaction protocol proceeds in one step under mild conditions with rapid reaction rate, excellent yields and regioselectivity. Photophysical property studies demonstrate that the facile molecular motions in solution can be inhibited in the solid state for these molecules, which leads to interesting AIE properties. This work provides not only a general design principle for AIEgens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize boron cluster&#8208;based photo&#8208;functional molecules.

A novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF) was synthesized to detoxify the mustard&#8208;gas simulant 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Compared with imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF demonstrates higher photooxidation of CEES into 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO). The COF linkages contribute to an intersystem crossing process and enhance the photochemical properties of the catalyst.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are appealing photocatalysts for toxic chemical degradation. Great efforts have been devoted to regulate the photocatalytic performance of COFs by tuning their organic building blocks, but the relationship between COF linkage and photochemical properties has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrinic COF, namely Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF. Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF (0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant with a half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 5&#8197;min, which is far lower than that of traditional imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF (t1/2=16&#8197;min). Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the aminal linkages of Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF facilitated the intersystem crossing process. Thus, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF showed higher triplet&#8208;state generation efficiency compared with Por&#8208;COF, consequently promoting the activation of oxygen molecular to singlet oxygen.

&lt;p&gt;A novel aminal-linked porphyrin-based covalent organic framework (Por-Aminal-COF) was synthesized to detoxify the mustard-gas simulant 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Compared with imine-linked Por-COF, Por-Aminal-COF demonstrates higher photooxidation of CEES into 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO). The COF linkages contribute to an intersystem crossing process and enhance the photochemical properties of the catalyst.

         <title>Effect of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed and Intercalated (Oxy)anions on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in decarbonizing our society, a wide range of (pre)catalysts with various non&#8208;active site elements (e.g., Mo, S, Se, N, P, C, Si&#8230;) have been investigated. Thermodynamics dictate that these elements oxidize during industrial operation. The formed oxyanions are water soluble and thus predominantly leach in a reconstruction process. Nevertheless, recently, it was unveiled that these thermodynamically stable (oxy)anions can adsorb on the surface or intercalate in the interlayer space of the active catalyst. There, they tune the electronic properties of the active sites and can interact with the reaction intermediates changing the OER kinetics and potentially breaking the persisting OER *OH/*OOH scaling relations. Thus, the addition of (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new design dimension for OER catalysis and the herein discussed observations deepen the understanding of the role of anions in the OER.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Chemoenzymatic Nanoreactor that Mimics NAD(P)H Oxidase for the In Situ Regeneration of Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a multifunctional chemoenzymatic nanoreactor (NanoNOx) for the glucose&#8208;controlled regeneration of natural and artificial nicotinamide cofactors. NanoNOx&#160;are built of glucose oxidase&#8211;polymer hybrids that assemble in the presence of an organometallic catalyst: hemin. The design of the hybrid is optimized to increase the effectiveness and the directional channeling at low substrate concentration. Importantly, NanoNOx can be reutilized without affecting the catalytic properties, can show high stability in the presence of organic solvents, and can effectively oxidize assorted natural and artificial enzyme cofactors. Finally, the hybrid was successfully coupled with NADH&#8208;dependent dehydrogenases in one&#8208;pot reactions, using a strategy based on the sequential injection of a fuel, namely, glucose. Hence, this study describes the first example of a hybrid chemoenzymatic nanomaterial able to efficiently mimic NOx enzymes in concurrent one&#8208;pot cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of Supramolecular Polymers: Finding the Right Conditions when Combining Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent synthesis is omnipresent in nature and potentially enables access to new materials. Yet, the fundamental principles that govern such a synthesis are barely understood. Here, we demonstrate how even simple reaction mixtures behave surprisingly complex when covalent reactions are coupled to self&#8208;assembly processes. Specifically, we study the reaction behavior of a system in which the  in&#8208;situ  formation of discotic benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomers is linked to an intertwined non&#8208;covalent reaction network including self&#8208;assembly into helical BTA polymers. This system shows an unexpected phase&#8208;separation behavior in which an interplay of reactant/product concentrations, side&#8208;products and solvent purity determines the system composition. We envision that these insights can bring us one step closer to how to design the synthesis of systems in a combined covalent/non&#8208;covalent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Relaxation through Single&#8208;Atom Metal Modification for Enhanced Fluorescence&#160;Efficiency in Molybdenum Disulfide Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To enhance the fluorescence efficiency of semiconductor  nanocrystals  quantum dots (QDs), strategies via enhancing  photo&#8208;absorption  and eliminating non&#8208;radiative relaxation have been proposed. In this study, we demonstrate that fluorescence efficiency of molybdenum disulfide quantum dots (MoS2  QDs) can be enhanced by single&#8208;atom metal  (Au, Ag, Pt, Cu)  modification. Four&#8208;fold enhancement of the fluorescence emission of MoS2  QDs is observed with single&#8208;atom Au modification. The underlying mechanism is ascribed to the passivation of non&#8208;radiative surface states&#160;owing to the new defect energy level of Au in the forbidden band that can trap excess electrons in n&#8208;type MoS2  , increasing the recombination probability of conduction band electrons with valence band holes of MoS2  . Our results open an avenue for enhancing the fluorescence efficiency of QDs via the modification of atomically dispersed metals, and extend their scopes and potentials in fundamental view for  economic efficiency and stability of single&#8208;atom metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Dynamic Regulation of the Mitochondrial GTP&#8208;to&#8208;GDP Ratio with a Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interconversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is known to be integral to a wide variety of biological cellular activities, yet to date there are no analytical methods availab le to directly detect the ratio of intracellular GTP to GDP. Herein, we report GRISerHR, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor to monitor the GTP:GDP ratio&#160; in multiple cell types and in various organelles under metabolic perturbation. Additionally, we characterized the differential mitochondrial GTP:GDP ratios resulting from genetic modulation of two isoforms of a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme (succinyl&#8208;CoA synthetase; SCS&#8208;ATP and SCS&#8208;GTP) and of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle enzyme (PEPCK&#8208;M). Thus, our GRISerHR sensor achieves spatiotemporally precise detection of dynamic changes in the endogenous GTP:GDP ratio in living cells and can help deepen our understanding about the energy metabolic contributions of guanosine nucleotides in biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Chemical Crosslinking for Profiling RNA&#8211;Protein Interactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic interactions between RNA and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. A photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy for studying the composition and dynamics of protein&#8211;RNA interactions via mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) as well as RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) is reported.







Abstract
The dynamic interactions between RNAs and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. Herein, we developed a photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy coupled with mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) and RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) for the study of the composition and dynamics of protein&#8208;RNA interactions. By integrating the blue light&#8208;triggered photocatalyst with a dual&#8208;functional RNA&#8211;protein crosslinker (RP&#8208;linker) and the phase separation&#8208;based enrichment strategy, PhotoCAX&#8208;MS revealed a total of 2044 RBPs in human HEK293 cells. We further employed PhotoCAX to investigate the dynamic change of RBPome in macrophage cells upon LPS&#8208;stimulation, as well as the identification of RBPs interacting directly with the 5&#8242; untranslated regions of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA.

         <title>Minimizing the Reorganization Energy of Cobalt Redox Mediators Maximizes Charge Transfer Rates from Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>

Choosing a redox&#8208;mediator with low reorganization energy vastly improves charge transfer rates from quantum dots by orders of magnitude.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced charge separation is at the very heart of many solar harvesting technologies. The reduction of energetic barriers to charge separation and transfer increases the rate of separation and the overall efficiency of these technologies. Here we report that the internal reorganization energy of the redox acceptor, the movement of the atoms with changing charge, has a profound effect on the charge transfer rates from donor quantum dots. We experimentally studied and modelled with Marcus Theory charge transfer to cobalt complexes that have similar redox potentials covering 350&#8197;mV, but vastly different reorganization energies spanning 2&#8197;eV. While the driving force does influence the electron transfer rates, the reorganization energies had a far more profound effect, increasing charge transfer rates by several orders of magnitude. Our studies suggest that careful design of redox mediators to minimize reorganization energy is an untapped route to drastically increase the efficiency of quantum dot applications that feature charge transfer.

         <title>MXene Analogue: A 2D Nitridene Solid Solution for High&#8208;Rate Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new MXene analogue, V&#8208;Mo&#8208;based 2D layered transition metal nitride solid solution (V0.2Mo0.8N1.2), was synthesized via a catalytic molten&#8208;salt method. It exhibited excellent activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reaction, superior to most MXenes. Boosted electrocatalytic performance originates from an optimized electronic structure induced by V atom alloying.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts for high&#8208;rate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial to clean fuel production. Nitrogen&#8208;rich 2D transition metal nitride, designated &#8220;nitridene&#8221;, has shown promising HER performance because of its unique physical/chemical properties. However, its synthesis is hindered by the sluggish growth kinetics. Here for the first time using a catalytic molten&#8208;salt method, we facilely synthesized a V&#8722;Mo bimetallic nitridene solid solution, V0.2Mo0.8N1.2, with tunable electrocatalytic property. The molten&#8208;salt synthesis reduces the growth barrier of V0.2Mo0.8N1.2 and facilitates V dissolution via a monomer assembly, as confirmed by synchrotron spectroscopy and ex situ electron microscopy. Furthermore, by merging computational simulations, we confirm that the V doping leads to an optimized electronic structure for fast protons coupling to produce hydrogen. These findings offer a quantitative engineering strategy for developing analogues of MXenes for clean energy conversions.

         <title>Enhanced Blue Afterglow through Molecular Fusion for Bio&#8208;applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular fusion strategy to achieve a high&#8208;efficiency photochemical afterglow system. The afterglow quantum yield was up to 2.59&#8201;%, which was significantly higher than that achieved with the physical mixing strategy and the covalent coupling strategy. This afterglow system was further used for high SNR bio&#8208;imaging and for the background&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity lateral flow immunoassay detection of &#946;&#8208;hCG.







Abstract
Afterglow materials have drawn considerable attention due to their attractive luminescent properties. However, their low&#8208;efficiency luminescence in aqueous environment limits their applications in life sciences. Here, we developed a molecular fusion strategy to improve the afterglow efficiency of photochemical afterglow materials. By fusing a cache unit with an emitter, we obtained a blue afterglow system with a quantum yield up to 2.59&#8201;%. This is 162&#8197;times higher than that achieved with the traditional physical mixing system and more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the covalent coupling system. High&#8208;efficiency afterglow nanoparticles were obtained and utilized for bio&#8208;imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 131, and for the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) of &#946;&#8208;hCG with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.34&#8197;mIU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. This paves a new way for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency afterglow materials and expands the number of luminescence reporter candidates for disease diagnosis and bio&#8208;imaging.

To better identify the structure of the active sites in zeolites under real reaction conditions, we demonstrate that the adsorption mode of acetone over classical Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) can be thermally converted into the induced Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) adsorption mode in SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite.







Abstract
Zeolites have found tremendous applications in the chemical industry. However, the dynamic nature of their active sites under the flow of adsorbate molecules for adsorption and catalysis is unclear, especially in operando conditions, which could be different from the as&#8208;synthesized structures. In the present study, we report a structural transformation of the adsorptive active sites in SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite by using acetone as a probe molecule under various temperatures. The combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, in situ variable&#8208;temperature synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in situ diffuse&#8208;reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy allow a clear identification and quantification that the chemisorption of acetone can convert the classical Br&#248;nsted acid site adsorption mode to an induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs adsorption mode at increasing temperatures. Such facile conversion is also supported by the calculations of ab&#8208;initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations. This work sheds new light on the importance of the dynamic structural alteration of active sites in zeolites with adsorbates at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Catalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Protonation for the Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Synergistic Effect of the Counterion and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pudovik addition/[1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement mediated by a chiral ScIII/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex led to axially chiral trisubstituted allenes with a diarylphosphinate moiety. A synergistic effect of the counterion and water enabled regio&#8208; and enantioselective protonation after [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. Intramolecular dearomatization of N&#8208;Ph&#8208;substituted products gave bridged polycyclic architectures through stereospecific Himbert reaction.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective tandem Pudovik addition/[1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;alkynylketoamides with diarylphosphine oxides was achieved with a N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex as the catalyst. This protocol features broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and good functional&#8208;group compatibility, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted allenes with a diarylphosphinate functionality in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee). Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that a synergistic effect of the counterion and water was critical for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective protonation after [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. The synthetic utility of this methodology was demonstrated by the conversion of products into complex bridged polycyclic architectures through intramolecular dearomatizing arene/allene cycloaddition.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and green mechanochemistry was performed to realize the reticular synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with predictable structures. Moreover, a series of Pd@HOF composites were generated by the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis, which showed different catalytic activities for CO oxidation. The synergetic effect between Pd and HOF was revealed by in situ DRIFTS, proving the application potential of functionalized HOF&#8208;composites.







Abstract
Rational synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with predicted structure has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, by using the efficient, simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable mechanosynthesis, we demonstrate that reticular chemistry is applicable to HOF assemblies based on building blocks with different geometry, connectivity, and functionality. The obtained crystalline HOFs show uniform nano&#8208;sized morphology, which is challenging or unachievable for conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Furthermore, the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis generated a series of Pd@HOF composites with noticeably different CO oxidation activities. In situ DRIFTS studies indicate that the most efficient composite, counterintuitively, shows the weakest CO affinity to Pd sites while the strongest CO affinity to HOF matrix, revealing the vital role of porous matrix to the catalytic performance. This work paves a new avenue for rational synthesis of HOF and HOF&#8208;based composites for broad application potential.

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Octahedral Cages with Three Types of Chirality towards Spontaneous Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular octahedral cages were obtained as conglomerates with spontaneous resolution. During crystallization, anions play a critical role in formation of racemic compounds or conglomerates. Moreover, the enantiopure cages are very stable in solution, and exhibit slow racemization even at extremely low concentrations.







Abstract
Chirality is one of the most important intrinsic properties of (supra)molecules. In this study, we obtained enantiomeric metallo&#8208;supramolecular octahedra without using any chiral sources. Such cages were self&#8208;assembled by prochiral trispyridine ligand L based on a C3h truxene core and CuII salts. Crystallization of the cages with BF4&#8722; as counterions afforded racemate crystals; while crystallizations of cages with ClO4&#8722; and OTf&#8722; as counterions resulted in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution. Three types of chirality were observed in each cage, including planar chirality of the truxene core, axial chirality from the pyridyl and truxene moieties, and propeller chirality of the pyridyl&#8208;CuII coordination sites. The cages reported here are among the largest discrete synthetic metallo&#8208;supramolecules ever reported with chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior. Remarkably, the chiral cages exhibited very slow racemization even at low concentrations, suggesting their high stability in solution.

         <title>Electronic Structure Changes of an Aromatic Amine Photoacid along the F&#246;rster Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic structural changes along the F&#246;rster cycle of an aromatic amine photoacid are monitored with time&#8208;resolved nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy, providing key insight into the factors responsible for the photoacidity properties.







Abstract
Photoacids show a strong increase in acidity in the first electronic excited state, enabling real&#8208;time studies of proton transfer in acid&#8208;base reactions, proton transport in energy storage devices and biomolecular sensor protein systems. Several explanations have been proposed for what determines photoacidity, ranging from variations in solvation free energy to changes in electronic structure occurring along the four stages of the F&#246;rster cycle. Here we use picosecond nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy to monitor the electronic structure changes of the proton donating group in a protonated aromatic amine photoacid in solution upon photoexcitation and subsequent proton transfer dynamics. Probing core&#8208;to&#8208;valence transitions locally at the amine functional group and with orbital specificity, we clearly reveal pronounced electronic structure, dipole moment and energetic changes on the conjugate photobase side. This result paves the way for a detailed electronic structural characterization of the photoacidity phenomenon.

         <title>Decorating Bacteria with Triple Immune Nanoactivators Generates Tumor&#8208;Resident Living Immunotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating bacteria with triple immune nanoactivators via in situ dopamine polymerization is reported to develop tumor&#8208;resident living immunotherapeutics. Decorated bacteria show a spatiotemporal tumor retention and a proliferation&#8208;dependent drug release, achieving potent antitumor effects in two antigen&#8208;overexpressing tumor models. This work provides a versatile platform to prepare multimodal long&#8208;acting therapeutics for tumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
An approach of decorating bacteria with triple immune nanoactivators is reported to develop tumor&#8208;resident living immunotherapeutics. Under cytocompatible conditions, tumor&#8208;specific antigens and checkpoint blocking antibodies are simultaneously conjugated onto bacterial surface and then polydopamine nanoparticles are formed via in situ dopamine polymerization. In addition to serving as a linker, polydopamine with its photothermal effect can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to a pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. The linked antigens promote the maturation of dendritic cells and generate tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, while the anchored antibodies block immune checkpoints and activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Decorated bacteria show spatiotemporal tumor retention and proliferation&#8208;dependent drug release, achieving potent antitumor effects in two antigen&#8208;overexpressing tumor models. This work provides a versatile platform to prepare multimodal and long&#8208;acting therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Ligand&#8208;Controlled Remote para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation and Borylation of Twisted Aromatic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic amides is reported. The para borylation proceeds via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa), which is different from the standard borylation ligand. A new type of catalytic system was developed by using this defa ligand that demonstrated excellent levels of para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides.







Abstract
A method of para&#8208;selective borylation of aromatic amides is described. The borylation proceeded via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa) that is different from the traditionally used ligand (dtbpy) for the C&#8722;H borylation reactions. The designed ligand framework (defa) has led to the development of a new type of catalytic system that shows excellent para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides. Moreover, the designed ligand has shown excellent reactivity and selectivity for a range of heterocyclic aromatic amides. The identification of key transition states and intermediates using the DFT computations associated with the three regio&#8208;isomeric pathways revealed that the most efficient catalytic pathway with the defa ligand leads to the para borylation while in the case of bpy the borylation at the para and meta sites compete.

         <title>A Valence&#8208;Engineered Self&#8208;Cascading Antioxidant Nanozyme for the Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A valence&#8208;engineered strategy to develop self&#8208;cascading nanozymes with simultaneous multiple antioxidant activities has been proposed. Nanozyme LiMn2O4 (LM), as the final optimized material, exhibits the best SOD&#8208;like, CAT&#8208;like, GPx&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities. The outstanding antioxidant capacity of LM was demonstrated at the cellular level and in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in mice.







Abstract
Antioxidant treatment strategy by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a highly effective disease treatment option. Nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities can cope with the diverse ROS environment. However, lack of design strategies and limitation of negative correlation for nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities hindered their development. To overcome these difficulties, here we used ZnMn2O4 as a model to explore the role of Mn valency at the octahedral site via a valence&#8208;engineered strategy, and found that its multiple antioxidant activities are positively correlated with the content of Mn4+. Therefore, through this strategy, a self&#8208;cascading antioxidant nanozyme LiMn2O4 was constructed, and its efficacy was verified at the cellular level and in an inflammatory bowel disease model. This work not only provides guidance for the design of multiple antioxidant nanozymes, but also broadens the biomedical application potential of multiple antioxidant nanozymes.

         <title>Interfacial Polymetallic Oxides and Hierarchical Porous Core&#8211;Shell Fibres for High Energy&#8208;Density Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres are demonstrated as high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes via a microchannel self&#8208;assembly method. Because of rich micro&#8208;/mesoporous ionic pathways, a large accessible surface, high Faradaic activity and excellent interface electron conduction, the supercapacitors display remarkable areal capacitance, energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life cycles and actual applications.







Abstract
Realizing high energy&#8208;density and actual applications of fibre&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to construct advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and Faradaic storage remain key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance FESCs based on hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres, where the large pseudo&#8208;active polymetallic oxide (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on a hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core. Due to the abundant micro&#8208;/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO&#8208;PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and manageable Faradaic reversibility in a 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO&#8208;PGF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs present high energy&#8208;density (187.22&#8197;&#956;&#8201;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;life cycles (95.8&#8201;% capacitive retention after 20&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), diverse&#8208;powered capabilities and actual energy&#8208;supply applications.

         <title>Fibrous Nanoreactors from Microfluidic Blow Spinning for Mass Production of Highly Stable Ligand&#8208;Free Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;spinning chemistry based on a microfluidic blow spinning (MBS) technique is developed to construct fibrous nanoreactors allowing mass production of ligand&#8208;free perovskite quantum dots (PQDs). The resultant PQDs/polymer nanofiber films possess high fluorescence stability under extreme conditions like light irradiation, heating and water dipping, which show potential applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;reactors have emerged as a powerful platform for chemical synthesis. Here, we develop fiber&#8208;spinning chemistry (FSC) based on a microfluidic blow spinning (MBS) technique, allowing the availability of nanoreactors for chemical synthesis with scale&#8208;up capacities. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments focus on the utilization of MBS&#8208;derived fibrous nanoreactors for large&#8208;scale production of ligand&#8208;free perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) in one step. Typically, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX3, X=Cl, Br, and I) PQDs in situ synthesized at large scale inside polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber films (size 120&#8197;cm &#215;30&#8197;cm per hour), exhibit high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of 71&#8201;%, tunable emissive peaks (448&#8211;600&#8197;nm), and superb PL stability. The PQDs/polymer nanofiber films are potentially useful for CO2 conversion, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays and light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices. These findings may guide the development of nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;reactor technology for scale&#8208;up production of nanomaterials with various potential applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nano-/micro-reactors have emerged as a powerful platform for chemical synthesis. Here, we develop fiber-spinning chemistry (FSC) based on a microfluidic blow spinning (MBS) technique, allowing the availability of nanoreactors for chemical synthesis with scale-up capacities. Proof-of-concept experiments focus on the utilization of MBS-derived fibrous nanoreactors for large-scale production of ligand-free perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) in one step. Typically, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X=Cl, Br, and I) PQDs in situ synthesized at large scale inside polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber films (size 120&#8197;cm &#215;30&#8197;cm per hour), exhibit high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of 71&#8201;%, tunable emissive peaks (448&#8211;600&#8197;nm), and superb PL stability. The PQDs/polymer nanofiber films are potentially useful for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, wide-color-gamut displays and light-emitting diode (LED) devices. These findings may guide the development of nano-/micro-reactor technology for scale-up production of nanomaterials with various potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Sensitized by a Chromium(III) Complex via an Underexplored Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular ruby [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ with an earth&#8208;abundant chromium(III) central ion sensitizes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator. The process involves a near&#8208;unity energy transfer efficiency via an underexplored reaction pathway, an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.54&#8197;eV, and a maximum upconversion quantum yield of 12.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) mainly relies on precious metal complexes thanks to their high intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiencies, excited state energies, and lifetimes, while complexes of abundant first&#8208;row transition metals are only rarely utilized and with often moderate UC quantum yields. [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ (bpmp=2,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)pyridine) containing earth&#8208;abundant chromium possesses an absorption band suitable for green light excitation, a doublet excited state energy matching the triplet energy of 9,10&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), a close to millisecond excited state lifetime, and high photostability. Combined ISC and doublet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from excited [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ to DPA gives 3DPA with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield. TTA of 3DPA furnishes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue UC with a quantum yield of 12.0&#8201;% (close to the theoretical maximum). Sterically less&#8208;hindered anthracenes undergo a [4+4] cycloaddition with [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ and green light.

         <title>Liquid Na/K Alloy Interfacial Synthesis of Functional Porous Carbon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbons were directly synthesized under ambient temperature via a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy. Unlike the traditional carbons, these materials are abundant with active sites of C&#8722;Cl bonds. Imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane were tandem&#8208;grafted on this porous carbon. Amine and bromide ion showed a synergistic effect to promote the catalytic reaction for cycloaddition of CO2, resulting in excellent catalytic performance.







Abstract
The functional groups in porous carbon generally suffer a severe loss during the high&#8208;temperature carbonization. Instead, the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of carbon featuring porous structures and abundant functional groups is not only a solution that evades the pitfalls of pyrolysis but also is of significance for the development of synthetic methodology. Herein, a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy is reported for the synthesis of porous carbon using CCl4 as the carbon precursor and sodium&#8208;potassium alloy (NaK) as the reducing agent, which is superior to traditional synthetic methods because it enables the engineering of a highly active liquid metal alloy microemulsion to directly generate porous carbon at ambient temperature. As synthesized porous carbon featured abundant carbon&#8208;chlorine bonds can be tandem&#8208;grafted with imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to achieve a CO2 cycloaddition catalyst, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity, in addition to exceptional stability.

         <title>A New Strategy to Fight Metallodrug Resistance: Mitochondria&#8208;Relevant Treatment through Mitophagy to Inhibit Metabolic Adaptations of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to fight metallodrug resistance through mitochondria&#8208;relevant treatment is reported. The cyclometalated IrIII complex Ir&#8208;Rhein could inhibit the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells by inducing severe mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Moreover, complex Ir&#8208;Rhein could overcome metallodrug resistance through the regulation of the platinum resistance&#8208;related transporters.







Abstract
Metabolic adaptations can help cancer cells to escape from chemotherapeutics, mainly involving autophagy and ATP production. Herein, we report a new rhein&#8208;based cyclometalated IrIII complex, Ir&#8208;Rhein, that can accurately target mitochondria and effectively inhibit metabolic adaptations. The complex Ir&#8208;Rhein induces severe mitochondrial damage and initiates mitophagy to reduce the number of mitochondria and subsequently inhibit both mitochondrial and glycolytic bioenergetics, which eventually leads to ATP starvation death. Moreover, Ir&#8208;Rhein can overcome cisplatin resistance. Co&#8208;incubation experiment, 3D tumor spheroids experiment and transcriptome analysis reveal that Ir&#8208;Rhein shows promising antiproliferation performance for cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells with the regulation of platinum resistance&#8208;related transporters. To our knowledge, this is a new strategy to overcome metallodrug resistance with a mitochondria&#8208;relevant treatment.

         <title>Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Armored MXene Membrane: Interlayer Engineering for Facilitated Water Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydrophilicity of nanochannels within 2D MXene&#8208;based membranes was readily engineered by poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) as tailor&#8208;made modifier to assemble MXene laminates via electrostatic and surpamolecular interactions. By judicious choice of exchangeable counter anion of the PILs, the interlayer galleries were precisely altered in a wide hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic range to amplify the nanofiltration performance.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene&#8208;based lamellar membranes bearing interlayers of tunable hydrophilicity are promising for high&#8208;performance water purification. The current challenge lies in how to engineer the pore wall's surface properties in the subnano&#8208;confinement environment while ensuring its high selectivity. Herein, poly(ionic liquid)s, equipped with readily exchangeable counter anions, succeeded as a hydrophilicity modifier in addressing this issue. Lamellar membranes bearing nanochannels of tailorable hydrophilicity are constructed via assembly of poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;armored MXene nanosheets. By shifting the interlayer galleries from being hydrophilic to more hydrophobic via simple anion exchange, the MXene membrane performs drastically better for both the permeance (by two&#8208;fold improvement) and rejection (&#8776;99&#8201;%). This facile method opens up a new avenue for building 2D material&#8208;based membranes of enhancing molecular transport and sieving effect.

         <title>Programmed Supramolecular Assemblies Using Orthogonal Pairs of Heterodimeric Coiled Coil Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;based supramolecular assemblies with pre&#8208;determined oligomeric states and topologies is reported. By using four polypeptide chains that form two orthogonal heterodimeric coiled coils and pre&#8208;installing covalent linkages between the non&#8208;complementary pairs in strategic arrangements, several discrete supramolecular assemblies with pre&#8208;determined molar masses and topologies were constructed.







Abstract
Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to program biomacromolecules to assemble into discrete nanostructures with pre&#8208;determined sizes and topologies. We report here a novel strategy to address this challenge. By using two orthogonal pairs of heterodimeric coiled coils as the building blocks, we constructed six discrete supramolecular assemblies, each composed of a prescribed number of coiled coil components. Within these assemblies, different coiled coils were connected via end&#8208;to&#8208;side covalent linkages strategically pre&#8208;installed between the non&#8208;complementary pairs. The overall topological features of two highly complex assemblies, a &#8220;barbell&#8221; and a &#8220;quadrilateral&#8221; form, were characterized experimentally and were in good agreement to the designs. This work expands the design paradigms for peptide&#8208;based discrete supramolecular assemblies and will provide a route for de novo fabrication of functional protein materials.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Deuterium Labelling of Anilines and Electron&#8208;Rich (Hetero)Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese biopolymer&#8208;supported catalyst is reported for hydrogen/deuterium exchange in anilines, phenols, heterocycles, and electron&#8208;rich arenes. Notably, taking advantage of deuterium oxide as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle isotope source, deuterated compounds are obtained in high yields in a practical manner.







Abstract
There is a constant need for deuterium&#8208;labelled products for multiple applications in life sciences and beyond. Here, a new class of heterogeneous catalysts is reported for practical deuterium incorporation in anilines, phenols, and heterocyclic substrates. The optimal material can be conveniently synthesised and allows for high deuterium incorporation using deuterium oxide as isotope source. This new catalyst has been fully characterised and successfully applied to the labelling of natural products as well as marketed drugs.

         <title>Evolution of the Dearomative Functionalization of Activated Quinolines and Isoquinolines: Expansion of the Electrophile Scope</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive functionalisation of quinolinium and isoquinolinium salts with formic acid as the terminal reductant was possible under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions or rhodium catalysis with very low catalyst loadings. A wide range of electrophiles, including enones, imides, unsaturated esters and sulfones, &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes and aldehydes, were intercepted by the enamine species formed in situ to generate substituted tetrahydro(iso)quinolines.







Abstract
Herein we disclose a mild protocol for the reductive functionalisation of quinolinium and isoquinolinium salts. The reaction proceeds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions as well as under rhodium catalysis with very low catalyst loadings (0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and uses inexpensive formic acid as the terminal reductant. A wide range of electrophiles, including enones, imides, unsaturated esters and sulfones, &#946;&#8208;nitro styrenes and aldehydes are intercepted by the in situ formed enamine species forming a large variety of substituted tetrahydro(iso)quinolines. Electrophiles are incorporated at the C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 position for quinolines and isoquinolines respectively, providing access to substitution patterns which are not favoured in electrophilic or nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Finally, this reactivity was exploited to facilitate three types of annulation reactions, giving rise to complex polycyclic products of a formal [3+3] or [4+2] cycloaddition.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic as a Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;metallization of intermetallic NiGa formed high&#8208;entropy intermetallics represented as (NiFeCu)(GaGe), which worked as a highly active and selective catalyst for acetylene semihydrogenation. Overhydrogenation of ethylene was completely inhibited even at complete conversion of acetylene. Moreover, the specific activity was at least five times higher than those in reported systems using selective Ni&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Acetylene semihydrogenation is a key technology for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene from crude ethylene. Ni&#8208;based catalysts are promising alternatives to noble&#8208;metals for this process. However, achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity remains a big challenge. We report a novel catalyst design based on high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEI), which provide thermally stable isolated Ni without excess counterpart metals and achieve exceptionally high performance. Intermetallic NiGa was multi&#8208;metalized to a (NiFeCu)(GaGe), where the Ni and Ga sites were partially substituted with Fe/Cu and Ge, respectively, without altering the parent CsCl&#8208;type structure. The NiFeCuGaGe/SiO2 HEI catalyst completely inhibited ethylene overhydrogenation even at complete acetylene conversion, and exhibited five&#8208;times higher activity than other 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The DFT study showed that the surface energy decreased by multi&#8208;metallization, which drastically weakened ethylene adsorption.

         <title>Electronically Engineering Water Resistance in Methane Combustion with an Atomically Dispersed Tungsten on PdO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane combustion generates less CO2 emissions than coal and oil, making it a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels. A PdW1/Al2O3 single&#8208;atom catalyst shows enhanced H2O&#8208;resistance during CH4 combustion. The results show that catalytic CH4 combustion involves water and proceeds via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction on the catalyst surface. An upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Pd aids the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.







Abstract
Improving the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;resistance of methane combustion catalysts is of importance for industrial applications and it is challenging. A stepwise strategy is presented for the preparation of atomically dispersed tungsten species at the catalytically active site (Pd nanoparticles). After an activation process, a Pd&#8722;O&#8722;W1&#8208;like nanocompound is formed on the PdO surface with an atomic scale interface. The resulting supported catalyst has much better water resistance than the conventional catalysts for methane combustion. The integrated characterization results confirm that catalytic combustion of methane involves water, proceeding via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface. The results of density functional theory calculations indicate an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of palladium caused by electron transfer from atomically dispersed tungsten, which greatly facilitates the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Polymer Adhesives: Straightforward Synthesis and Strong Substrate Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthetic strategy towards strong supramolecular adhesives is reported, based on a side&#8208;chain barbiturate (Ba) and Hamilton wedge (HW) functionalized polymer. Specific Ba/HW interactions serve as cohesive domains to maintain polymeric network integrity, while molecular configuration of individual Ba or HW moieties linked onto substrates via diverse H&#8208;bonding interactions, form adhesive domains and endow strong adherence.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance adhesives are of great interest in view of industrial demand. We herein identify a straightforward synthetic strategy towards universal hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) polymeric adhesives, using a side&#8208;chain barbiturate (Ba) and Hamilton wedge (HW) functionalized copolymer. Starting from a rubbery copolymer containing thiolactone derivatives, Ba and HW moieties are tethered as pendant groups via an efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step amine&#8208;thiol&#8208;bromo conjugation. Hetero&#8208;complementary Ba/HW interactions thus yield H&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymeric networks. In addition to an enhanced polymeric network integrity induced by specific Ba/HW association, the presence of individual Ba or HW moieties enables strong binding to a range of substrates, outstanding compared to commercial glues and reported adhesives.

         <title>Avoiding Structural Collapse to Reduce Lead Leakage in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structural collapse in perovskite films governs the Pb leakage after exposure to water as indicated by Noyes&#8208;Whitney Model simulation. It is effectively retarded by constructing a chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite (DOE)PbI4&#8722;xClx at the surface of the film.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. As an essential element for high&#8208;efficiency PSCs however, the heavy metal Pb is soluble in water, causing a serious threat to the environment and human health. Due to the weak ionic bonding in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites, drastic structure decomposition occurs when immersing the perovskite film in water, which accelerates the Pb leakage. By introducing the chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface, the film dissolution is significantly slowed down, which retards lead leakage. As a result, the Pb contamination is dramatically reduced under various extreme conditions. In addition, the PSCs device deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6&#8201;% and retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking for over 1100&#8197;h.

         <title>A Hybrid Supramolecular Polymeric Nanomedicine for Cascade&#8208;Amplified Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine for cascade&#8208;amplified synergetic chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy is constructed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. In synergy with a checkpoint blockade, this supramolecular nanomedicine leads to an enhanced therapeutic performance and long&#8208;term tumor remission.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanomedicines have shown great merits in cancer therapy, but their clinical translation is hampered by monotonous therapeutic modality and unsatisfactory antitumor performance. Herein, a hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine (SNPs) is developed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin (CPT) host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. Iron ions stabilizing SNPs catalyze the conversion of intracellular hydrogen peroxide into highly toxic hydroxyl radical through a Fenton reaction, which further cleaves the thioketal linker of the supramolecular monomer to release potent CPT, thus amplifying the therapeutic efficacy by combining chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The combination therapy stimulates antitumor immunity and promotes intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by triggering immunogenic cell death. In synergy with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade, SNPs enables enhanced immune therapy and a long&#8208;term tumor remission.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Bipyrrole&#8208;Based Tetra&#8208;BF2 Flag&#8208;Hinge Chromophores: Achieving Multicolor and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetra&#8208;BF2 complexes with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole ligands that emit in the visible to red region in solution and in the solid state were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The dyes are rigid but can rotate flexibly around the bipyrrole moiety, resulting in large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Tuning the rotational barrier enables circularly polarized emission based on axial chirality to be achieved.







Abstract
This study reports the facile syntheses of tetra&#8208;boron difluoride (tetra&#8208;BF2) complexes, flag&#8208;hinge&#8208;like molecules that exhibit intense green&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence in solution and yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emission in the solid states. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations suggested a bent structure of this series of compounds. The complexes also exhibited excellent optical properties, with quantum yields reaching 100&#8201;% and a large Stokes shift. These properties were attributed to the altered bending angle of the molecule in the S1 excited state. As the rotational motion was suppressed around the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole axis, atropisomers with axial chirality were formed, which are optically resolvable into (R) and (S)&#8208;enantiomers through a chiral column. The atropisomers thus function as circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials, in which the color (green, green&#8208;yellow, and yellow) can be varied by controlling the aggregation state. This rational design of multi&#8208;BF2 complexes can potentially realize novel photofunctional materials.

         <title>Pushing Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries towards Practical Working Conditions through a Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of cathode engineering and electrolyte manipulation effectively enhance redox kinetics and cycling stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. This strategy is demonstrated to be effective in achieving high performance under wide temperature situations and enabling a stable Li&#8722;S pouch cell under a thin Li&#8208;metal anode, thick S cathode, and lean electrolyte conditions.







Abstract
The commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is still hindered by the unsatisfactory cell performance under practical working conditions, which is mainly caused by the sluggish cathode redox kinetics, severe polysulfide shuttling, and poor Li stripping/plating reversibility. Herein, we report an effective strategy by combining Se&#8208;doped S hosted in an ordered macroporous framework with a highly fluorinated ether (HFE)&#8208;based electrolyte to simultaneously address the aforementioned issues in both cathode and anode. A reversible and stable high areal capacity of &gt;5.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.2&#8201;% can be achieved under high areal Se/S loading (5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), while the underlying mechanism was further revealed through synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes and Time&#8208;of&#8208;Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). The practical application potential was further evaluated at low (0&#8201;&#176;C) and high (55&#8201;&#176;C) temperatures under high areal Se/S loading (&gt;5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li metal (40&#8197;&#956;m).

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atom Fe1Sx on Mesoporous TiO2 for Boosting Ambient Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;coordinated Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts on mesoporous TiO2 have been constructed by a universal lattice&#8208;confined strategy. This catalyst shows a unique nanoconfinement effect for the mass transfer and maximizes the active sites to mimic nitrogenase for ambient electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Mimicking natural nitrogenase to create highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for ambient N2 fixation is highly desired, but still challenging. Herein, S&#8208;coordinated Fe SACs on mesoporous TiO2 have been constructed by a lattice&#8208;confined strategy. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra demonstrate that Fe atoms are anchored in TiO2 lattice via the FeS2O2 coordination configuration. Theoretical calculations reveal that FeS2O2 sites are the active centers for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Moreover, the finite element analysis shows that confinement of opened and ordered mesopores can facilitate the mass transport and offer an enlarged active surface area for NRR. As a result, this catalyst delivers a favorable NH3 yield rate of 18.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 with a high Faradaic efficiency of 17.3&#8201;% at &#8722;0.20&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Most importantly, this lattice&#8208;confined strategy is universal and can also be applied to Ni1Sx@TiO2, Co1Sx@TiO2, Mo1Sx@TiO2, and Cu1Sx@TiO2 SACs. Our study provides new hints for the design and biomimetic synthesis of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts.

         <title>An Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Neutrophils in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable polymeric nanoprobe (SPCy) is synthesized for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) detection of neutrophil elastase (NE), a biomarker of tumor&#8208;associated neutrophils (TANs). SPCy reacts with NE in tumors to only turn on the NIRF and PA signals of hemicyanine but not the reference polymer backbone, leading to ratiometric NIRF and increased PA signals of TANs during cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Imaging to evaluate tumor&#8208;associated neutrophils (TANs) is imperative for cancer immunotherapy but remains challenging. We herein report an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPCy) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of neutrophil elastase (NE), a biomarker of TANs. SPCy comprises a semiconducting polymer conjugated with a hemicyanine (hemi&#8208;Cy) dye caged by a NE&#8208;cleavable peptide as the side chain. After systemic administration, SPCy passively targets the tumor and reacts with NE to &#8220;uncage&#8221; the hemi&#8208;Cy, leading to enhanced NIRF and PA signals of the hemi&#8208;Cy but unchanged signals of the SP. Such NE&#8208;activated ratiometric NIRF and enhanced PA signals of SPCy correlate with the intratumoral population of TANs. Thus, this study not only presents the first TAN&#8208;specific PA probe, but also provides a general molecular design strategy for PA imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers to facilitate screening of cancer immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation with Water Vapor on Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#8208;Decorated Defective Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically active sites are designed for CO2 methanation with water by integrating defective polymeric carbon nitride with single Pt atoms. Single Pt sites, carbon nitride defects and &#8722;OH groups synergistically work for different functions to achieve high activity and selectivity for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with water is an important route to simultaneously address carbon neutrality and produce fuels. It is challenging to achieve high selectivity in CO2 methanation due to competing reactions. Nonetheless, aspects of the catalyst design can be controlled with meaningful effects on the catalytic outcomes. We report highly selective CO2 methanation with water vapor using a photocatalyst that integrates polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with single Pt atoms. As revealed by experimental characterization and theoretical simulations, the widely explored Pt&#8722;CN catalyst is adapted for selective CO2 methanation with our rationally designed synthetic method. The synthesis creates defects in CN along with formation of hydroxyl groups proximal to the coordinated Pt atoms. The photocatalyst exhibits high activity and carbon selectivity (99&#8201;%) for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with pure water. This work provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for selective CO2 methanation.

         <title>Strain of Supramolecular Interactions in Single&#8208;Stacking Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strains of supramolecular interaction were explored, and revealed an odd&#8211;even effect in a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions, offering new insights into the supramolecular interaction from the molecular level.







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics provide opportunities to integrate molecular building blocks into electronic circuits, and investigations of the mechanical properties of the non&#8208;covalent interactions are necessary to understand the role of the assembly configuration in the electronic coupling among different assembly blocks. However, the mechanical characterization of supramolecular interactions remains experimentally challenging. We investigated the strain distribution of the supramolecular interactions through a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions. The alpha values exhibit a clear odd&#8208;even effect versus the numbers of thiophene rings. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that a larger rotational barrier of the single&#8208;stacking junctions with an even number of thiophene rings leads to limited torsional freedom and thus a smaller strain distribution. These results provide new insights into the control of supramolecular interactions by the design of the basic molecular building blocks.

         <title>Synergy in Au&#8722;CuO Janus Structure for Catalytic Isopropanol Oxidative Dehydrogenation to Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Au&#8722;CuO Janus structure with a 0.5&#8197;nm ultrathin CuO layer was developed. The Au&#8722;CuO interfacial structure was confirmed to be extremely efficient for C&#8722;H activation; a dramatic decrease of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond scission energy barrier from 1.44 to 0.01&#8197;eV due to the strong affinity between the O of CuO and H of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone, was observed.

The controlled oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding ketones or aldehydes via selective cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols under mild conditions still remains a significant challenge. Although the metal/oxide interface is highly active and selective, the interfacial sites fall far behind the demand, due to the large and thick support. Herein, we successfully develop a unique Au&#8722;CuO Janus structure (average particle size=3.8&#8197;nm) with an ultrathin CuO layer (0.5&#8197;nm thickness) via a bimetal in situ activation and separation strategy. The resulting Au&#8722;CuO interfacial sites prominently enhance isopropanol adsorption and decrease the energy barrier of &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond scission from 1.44 to 0.01&#8197;eV due to the strong affinity between the O atom of CuO and the H atom of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone, thereby achieving ultrahigh acetone selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) over 1.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% AuCu0.75/Al2O3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure with 97.5&#8201;% isopropanol conversion. Furthermore, Au&#8722;CuO Janus structures supported on SiO2, TiO2 or CeO2 exhibit remarkable catalytic performance, and great promotion in activity and acetone selectivity is achieved as well for other reducible oxides derived from Fe, Co, Ni and Mn. This study should help to develop strategies for maximized interfacial site construction and structure optimization for efficient &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Triarylamine/Bithiophene Copolymer with Enhanced Quinoidal Character as Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triarylamine/bithiophene copolymers (TABT), synthesized via iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling, have been applied as hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Owing to the film uniformity, enhanced quinoidal conjugation in radical cation state, and excellent ionization potential matching, a PVSC using a mesityl substituted TABT polymer outperformed devices using reference standards such as PTAA and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.







Abstract
Polytriarylamine is a popular hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) despite its suboptimal conductivity and significant recombination at the interface in a solar cell setup. Having noted insufficient conjugation among the triarylamine units along the polymer backbone, we inserted a bithiophene unit between two triarylamine units through iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling of a triarylamine/thiophene monomer so that two units conjugate effectively via four quinoidal rings when the molecule functions as HTM. The obtained triarylamine/bithiophene copolymer (TABT) used as HTM showed a high&#8208;performance in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) solar cells. Mesityl substituted TABT forms a uniform film, shows high hole&#8208;carrier mobility, and has an ionization potential (IP=5.40&#8197;eV) matching that of MAPbI3. We fabricated a solar cell device with a power conversion efficiency of 21.3&#8201;% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.15&#8197;V, which exceeds the performance of devices using reference standard such as poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.

         <title>Beyond Bioisosteres: Divergent Synthesis of Azabicyclohexanes and Cyclobutenyl Amines from Bicyclobutanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the divergent reactivity of bicyclobutanes undergoing addition to imines, highly&#8208;functionalized and stereochemically&#8208;defined azabicyclohexanes and cyclobutenyl amines are easily accessible. These modular syntheses provide new and selective methods to prepare Csp3&#8208;rich scaffolds with potential beyond bioisosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The development of two divergent and complementary Lewis acid catalyzed additions of bicyclobutanes to imines is described. Microscale high&#8208;throughput experimentation was integral to the discovery and optimization of both reactions. N&#8208;arylimines undergo formal (3+2) cycloaddition with bicyclobutanes to yield azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in a single step; in contrast, N&#8208;alkylimines undergo an addition/elimination sequence to generate cyclobutenyl methanamine products with high diastereoselectivity. These new products contain a variety of synthetic handles for further elaboration, including many functional groups relevant to pharmaceutical synthesis. The divergent reactivity observed is attributed to differences in basicity and nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom in a common carbocation intermediate, leading to either nucleophilic attack (N&#8208;aryl) or E1 elimination (N&#8208;alkyl).

         <title>Introducing 4s&#8211;2p Orbital Hybridization to Stabilize Spinel Oxide Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong molecular bonding formed by Ge 4s and O 2p orbitals contributes to a robust and endurable metal&#8211;oxygen framework of the spinel oxide structure, which is not achievable via common 3d&#8211;2p orbital hybridization alone, making the oxide cathodes exhibit extraordinarily stable electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Oxides composed of an oxygen framework and interstitial cations are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the instability of the oxygen framework under harsh operating conditions results in fast battery capacity decay, due to the weak orbital interactions between cations and oxygen (mainly 3d&#8211;2p interaction). Here, a robust and endurable oxygen framework is created by introducing strong 4s&#8211;2p orbital hybridization into the structure using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 oxide as an example. The modified oxide delivers extraordinarily stable battery performance, achieving 71.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work shows that an orbital&#8208;level understanding can be leveraged to engineer high structural stability of the anion oxygen framework of oxides. Moreover, the similarity of the oxygen lattice between oxide electrodes makes this approach extendable to other electrodes, with orbital&#8208;focused engineering a new avenue for the fundamental modification of battery materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypercoordinated Silicon Anions: Catching Intermediates of Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane serves as a binding platform for weak anionic donors, providing the first characterized anionic bromido, iodido, formato, acetato, triflato, and sulfato silicates. This set allows to evaluate the structural and electronic perturbation of silicon species and substantiates their role in Lewis base catalysis.







Abstract
Anionic hypercoordinated silicates with weak donors were proposed as key intermediates in numerous silicon&#8208;based reactions. However, their short&#8208;lived nature rendered even spectroscopic observations highly challenging. Here, we characterize hypercoordinated silicon anions, including the first bromido&#8208;, iodido&#8208;, formato&#8208;, acetato&#8208;, triflato&#8208; and sulfato&#8208;silicates. This is enabled by a new, donor&#8208;free polymeric form of Lewis superacidic bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane 1. Spectroscopic, structural, and computational insights allow a reassessment of Gutmann's empirical rules for the role of silicon hypercoordination in synthesis and catalysis. The electronic perturbations of 1 exerted on the bound anions indicate pronounced substrate activation.

&lt;p&gt;The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane serves as a binding platform for weak anionic donors, providing the first characterized anionic bromido, iodido, formato, acetato, triflato, and sulfato silicates. This set allows to evaluate the structural and electronic perturbation of silicon species and substantiates their role in Lewis base catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic hypercoordinated silicates with weak donors were proposed as key intermediates in numerous silicon-based reactions. However, their short-lived nature rendered even spectroscopic observations highly challenging. Here, we characterize hypercoordinated silicon anions, including the first bromido-, iodido-, formato-, acetato-, triflato- and sulfato-silicates. This is enabled by a new, donor-free polymeric form of Lewis superacidic bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Spectroscopic, structural, and computational insights allow a reassessment of Gutmann's empirical rules for the role of silicon hypercoordination in synthesis and catalysis. The electronic perturbations of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exerted on the bound anions indicate pronounced substrate activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicolor Zinc(II)&#8208;Coordinated Hydrazone&#8208;Based Bistable Photoswitches for Rewritable Transparent Luminescent Labels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches with high emission quantum yields, excellent reversible photoisomerization properties, and long thermal stability are reported. Impressively, multiple emission colors can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Furthermore, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with extremely high resolution and stability is achieved.







Abstract
Repeatable printing of invisible multicolor luminescence patterns with long retention times on transparent substrates is of significant importance, but it remains a formidable challenge. Here, two novel hydrazone&#8208;based on/off fluorescent photoswitches with decent emission quantum efficiencies, good reversible photoisomerization properties, and extremely long thermal half&#8208;lives, were designed and synthesized. Excitingly, X&#8208;ray crystallography data of both Z and E isomers of one hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch were obtained. Multiple emission colors of blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Moreover, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with high resolution was achieved by using these photoswitches. Importantly, the legibility of the printed patterns can last at least over 3&#8197;months without detectable emission intensity loss under ambient conditions.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Catalyzed Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Benzaldehydes via a Transient Imine Directing Group
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient C&#8722;H sulfonylation of benzaldehydes is achieved using copper and catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a directing group in situ. Aldehydes and sulfinate salts are coupled in a single step in high yields. Kinetic and mechanistic investigations are presented, with insights to the C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Transient directing groups (TDGs) can provide a powerful means for C&#8722;H functionalization without requiring additional steps for directing group introduction and removal. We report the first use of a TDG in combination with copper to effect C&#8722;H functionalization. The regioselective copper mediated &#946;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H sulfonylation of aldehydes with sulfinate salts is accomplished using catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a transient imine. A broad range of sulfonylated benzaldehydes are prepared using copper fluoride as both copper source and oxidant, involving a [5,6] cupracyclic intermediate. &#947;&#8208;(peri)&#8208;Sulfonylation of napthyl and phenanthrenyl carboxaldehydes is achieved through [6,6] cupracyclic intermediates. Further derivatisation of the aldehyde products is demonstrated. Kinetic experiments and Hammett analysis suggest the turnover limiting step to be a concerted asynchronous C&#8722;H cleavage via a dearomative Wheland&#8208;type transition state.

         <title>Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Photothermal Immunotherapy Based on a Versatile NIR&#8208;II Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen displaying fluorescence, photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging functions was designed by using a benzo[c]thiophene moiety as a building block. This luminogen, when applied with an integrated programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) antibody, exhibits unprecedented performance in multimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal immunotherapy towards breast tumors.







Abstract
Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has captured great attention owing to the mutually strengthening therapeutic outcomes towards both original tumors and abscopal tumors. Herein, a versatile theranostic agent displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ, was designed and prepared based on benzo[c]thiophene unit as a building block; it can be used for simultaneous fluorescence imaging (FLI) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and thermal eradication of tumors. Further experiments validate that photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ nanoparticles not only destroys the primary tumor but also enhances immunogenicity for further suppressing the growth of tumors at distant sites. Furthermore, PTT combining a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody prevents the metastasis and recurrence of cancer by potentiating the effect of immunotherapy.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Regulation of FeN4 Spin State by Neighboring Cu Atoms for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis in Flexible Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
First&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of critical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) steps with the Fe magnetic moment of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C composites. This is indeed observed when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C aerogels, where the interactions between adjacent Fe&#8722;Cu 3d electrons result in a reduced magnetic moment of the Fe center and hence enhanced ORR activity.







Abstract
Iron, nitrogen&#8208;codoped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) nanocomposites have emerged as viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the formation of FeNxCy coordination moieties. In this study, results from first&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of key reaction steps with the Fe magnetic moment. Experimentally, when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C aerogels (denoted as NCAG/Fe&#8722;Cu), the Fe centers exhibit a reduced magnetic moment and markedly enhanced ORR activity within a wide pH range of 0&#8211;14. With the NCAG/Fe&#8722;Cu nanocomposites used as the cathode catalyst in a neutral/quasi&#8208;solid aluminum&#8211;air and alkaline/quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8211;air battery, both achieve a remarkable performance with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.00 and 1.51&#8197;V, large power density of 130 and 186&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and good mechanical flexibility, all markedly better than those with commercial Pt/C or Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts at the cathode.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free SF6 Activation: A New SF5&#8208;Based Reagent Enables Deoxyfluorination and Pentafluorosulfanylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reagent has been designed through 2&#8208;electron activation of SF6 with commercially available tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) under blue LED irradiation. The versatility of this new SF5&#8208;based reagent has been demonstrated for the deoxyfluorination of CO2 and the fluorinative desulfurization of CS2 affording useful fluorinated amines. Moreover, SF5Cl could be generated under mild conditions from reagent I allowing chloro&#8208;pentafluorosulfanylation of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
The activation of SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, under metal&#8208;free and visible light conditions is reported. Herein, mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy, NMR studies and cyclic voltammetry allowed the rational design of a new fluorinating reagent which was synthesized from the 2&#8208;electron activation of SF6 with commercially available TDAE. This new SF5&#8208;based reagent was efficiently employed for the deoxyfluorination of CO2 and the fluorinative desulfurization of CS2 allowing the formation of useful fluorinated amines. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrated that our SF5&#8208;based reagent could afford the mild generation of Cl&#8208;SF5 gas. This finding was exploited for the chloro&#8208;pentafluorosulfanylation of alkynes and alkenes.

         <title>Modular Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Concave Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for High&#8208;Performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Tunable Emission Mechanisms
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved and fully conjugated N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N&#8208;PAHs) were utilized as efficient emitters in thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diode (TADF/OLED) devices. The curvature increases the spatial separation between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, leading to low singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, which are essential for high reverse intersystem crossing rates. The overall photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 86&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although bowl&#8208;shaped N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can achieve excellent electron&#8208;donating ability, their application for optoelectronics is hampered by typically low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). To address this issue, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and fully conjugated nitrogen&#8208;doped PAHs. Through structural modifications to the electron&#8208;accepting moiety, we are able to switch the mechanism of luminescence between thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), and to tune the overall PLQY in the range from 9&#8201;% to 86&#8201;%. As a proof of concept, we constructed solid&#8208;state organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices, which has not been explored to date in the context of concave N&#8208;doped systems being TADF/RTP emitters. The best&#8208;performing dye, possessing a peripheral trifluoromethyl group adjacent to the phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow to orange emission with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12&#8201;%, which is the highest EQE in a curved D&#8208;A embedded N&#8208;PAH to date.

         <title>Computational Design, Synthesis, and Photochemistry of Cy7&#8208;PPG, an Efficient NIR&#8208;Activated Photolabile Protecting Group for Therapeutic Applications
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The computational design and synthesis of Cy7&#8208;PPG, a new oxygen&#8208;independent novel near&#8208;infrared photolabile protecting group (PPG) is reported. Cy7&#8208;PPG is the most redshifted PPG to date (&#955;max=746&#8197;nm), with unmatched near&#8208;infrared molecular absorptivity and aqueous solubility, and excellent uncaging efficiency, paving the way for the use of PPGs in the clinic.







Abstract
Photolabile Protecting Groups (PPGs) are molecular tools used, for example, in photopharmacology for the activation of drugs with light, enabling spatiotemporal control over their potency. Yet, red&#8208;shifting of PPG activation wavelengths into the NIR range, which penetrates the deepest in tissue, has often yielded inefficient or insoluble molecules, hindering the use of PPGs in the clinic. To solve this problem, we report herein a novel concept in PPG design, by transforming clinically&#8208;applied NIR&#8208;dyes with suitable molecular orbital configurations into new NIR&#8208;PPGs using computational approaches. Using this method, we demonstrate how Cy7, a class of NIR dyes possessing ideal properties (NIR&#8208;absorption, high molecular absorptivity, excellent aqueous solubility) can be successfully converted into Cy7&#8208;PPG. We report a facile synthesis towards Cy7&#8208;PPG from accessible precursors and confirm its excellent properties as the most redshifted oxygen&#8208;independent NIR&#8208;PPG to date (&#955;max=746&#8197;nm).

Advancing the construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials by molecular design has become an important target in this research area. In their Research Article (e202204358), Yoshio Hisaeda, Toshikazu Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a new bipyrrole&#8208;based boron difluoride family exhibiting intense multicolor luminescence with easy synthetic access. Tuning the rotational barrier around the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole affords CPL, and multicolor CPL can be achieved by controlling the aggregation state.

A chiral Lewis acid accelerated asymmetric Pudovik addition/[1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement is described by Shunxi Dong, Qian Peng, Xiaoming Feng, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202203650). Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that a synergistic effect of the counterion and water was critical for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective protonation after the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A chiral Lewis acid accelerated&lt;/b&gt; asymmetric Pudovik addition/[1,2]-phospha-Brook rearrangement is described by Shunxi Dong, Qian Peng, Xiaoming Feng, and co-workers in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202203650"&gt;e202203650&lt;/a&gt;). Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that a synergistic effect of the counterion and water was critical for the regio- and enantioselective protonation after the [1,2]-phospha-Brook rearrangement.

         <title>Inside Cover: Electronic Structure Changes of an Aromatic Amine Photoacid along the F&#246;rster Cycle (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 27/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoacids have been understood, since the pioneering work of Theodor F&#246;rster more than seven decades ago, to show a pronounced increase in acidity when electronically excited, but the underlying microscopic mechanisms have remained elusive. Sebastian Eckert et&#8197;al. show in their Research Article (e202200709) how time&#8208;resolved nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy along the F&#246;rster cycle of a photoacid provides key insight into the electronic structural factors responsible for the photoacidity phenomenon.

The morphinan alkaloids , especially codeine and morphine, are derived from the opium poppy and have been used for millennia for pain management. They remain vital medicines today, but climate change and geopolitical uncertainties threaten existing supply chains. In their Communication (e202203186), Martin&#8197;G. Banwell, Ping Lan, and co&#8208;workers detail by far the shortest synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;codeine reported to date, which involves a total &#8220;in&#8208;flask&#8221; time of less than 24&#8197;hours.

         <dc:description>
Conducting electrochemistry in an applied magnetic field generates forces that affect the electrochemical system due to a change in fundamental electrochemical principles. The fundamental mechanisms behind the observed changes in different applications are discussed in this Review. Suggestions on interference exclusion and possible future perspectives of magnetoelectrochemistry are also proposed.







Abstract
Developing new strategies to advance the fundamental understanding of electrochemistry is crucial to mitigating multiple contemporary technological challenges. In this regard, magnetoelectrochemistry offers many strategic advantages in controlling and understanding electrochemical reactions that might be tricky to regulate in conventional electrochemical fields. However, the topic is highly interdisciplinary, combining concepts from electrochemistry, hydrodynamics, and magnetism with experimental outcomes that are sometimes unexpected. In this Review, we survey recent advances in using a magnetic field in different electrochemical applications organized by the effect of the generated forces on fundamental electrochemical principles and focus on how the magnetic field leads to the observed results. Finally, we discuss the challenges that remain to be addressed to establish robust applications capable of meeting present needs.

         <title>Layered Organic Metal Chalcogenides (OMCs): From Bulk to Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, organic metal chalcogenides are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, which are exquisitely desired but impossible to realize by traditional methods for the synthesis of 2D materials. This Minireview gives a perspective on the structural design of bulk precursors, exfoliation methods, applications, and discusses research directions based on recently published work.







Abstract
The modification of inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with organic functional motifs is in high demand for the optimization of their properties, but it is still a daunting challenge. Organic metal chalcogenides (OMCs) are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, with metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, these materials are extremely desirable but impossible to realize by traditional methods. Both the inorganic layer and organic functional motifs of OMCs are highly designable and thus provide this type of 2D materials with enormous variety in terms of their structure and properties. This Minireview aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are discussed.

Organic metal chalcogenides (OMCs) are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, with metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long-range ordered organic functional motifs, these materials are extremely desirable but impossible to realize by traditional methods. Both the inorganic layer and organic functional motifs of OMCs are highly designable and thus provide this type of 2D materials with enormous variety in terms of their structure and properties. This Minireview aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality of Perylene Diimides: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perylene diimide has been extensively studied as a &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule for the construction of chiral small molecules and helical supramolecular aggregates, such as twisted ribbons and helical fibers. This Minireview discusses the strategies for designing chiral perylene diimides through chemical modifications and assembly, as well as the chiroptical and biological applications of chiral perylene diimides.







Abstract
Chirality is a particularly important concept in nature and exists at all length scales, ranging from the molecular level to the supramolecular level. Over the last two decades, various design strategies have been developed to construct chiral materials based on perylene diimides (PDIs) and to mimic the chiral assembly process in biological systems, but applications of these chiral aggregates are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and properties of chiral PDIs. The chirality in PDI&#8208;based materials can be generated by three different approaches: from the twisted planes of PDIs, the chiral substituents of PDIs, and the co&#8208;assembly of achiral PDIs and chiral guests. A comprehensive understanding of the applications of chiral PDIs as well as potential future developments is also provided.

         <title>Scalable Nitrate Treatment for Constructing Integrated Surface Structures to Mitigate Capacity Fading and Voltage Decay of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable nitrate treatment for constructing surface&#8208;integrated structure was developed to mitigate capacity fading and voltage decay. A rule for building robust surface&#8208;integrated structure is also proposed. When the binding energy of the structure locates at a low level and the Bader charge of the O atoms nearest to the cationic atoms is as small as possible, an advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode can be obtained.







Abstract
Capacity fading and voltage decay is one of the biggest obstacles for the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides due to the serious surface&#8208;related detrimental reactions. Herein, we develop a versatile and scalable method to construct a robust surface&#8208;integrated structure. All the designed samples deliver outstanding capacity and voltage stability, among which the Zn&#8208;treated sample possesses the best electrochemical performance. Its capacity retention is larger than 90&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles with a voltage decay ratio as small as 0.73&#8197;mV per cycle. What is more, the rules of surface&#8208;integrated structure with different cations in terms of capacity and voltage stability is further deciphered by combining with density function theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that to obtain advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, cations in Li&#8208;sites should firstly ensure the binding energy of the surface&#8208;integrated structure in a lower level and then provide Bader charge for the nearest O atoms as small as possible.

         <title>Saving the Energy Loss in Lithium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Fixation by Using a Highly Reactive Li3N Intermediate for C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A successive reaction that yields aryl imides through combining lithium&#8208;mediated N2 fixation and C&#8722;N coupling is reported. Instead of simply being hydrolyzed to NH3 with energy wasted, this work first focuses on electro&#8208;synthetic Li3N from N2&#8208;fixation for the direct synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing chemicals, which will compensate for the energy consumption of Li plating and make the electrochemical N2 fixation more economical.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of N&#8208;containing organic compounds from dinitrogen (N2) can make synthetic chemistry more sustainable. Previous bottlenecks in lithium&#8208;mediated N2 fixation were resolved by loading Li&#8208;metal anodes covered with the typical Li+ ion&#8208;conducting solid electrolyte interface, which are subsequently allowed to react with N2. The developed strategy allowed us to reach high Faradaic efficiencies toward Li3N. These reactive Li3N were then contacted with acylchlorides. Surface nitride ions are more nucleophilic than amines which direct the two C&#8722;N coupling reactions toward formation of imides rather than amides, and an integrated current efficiency of 57&#8211;77&#8201;% could be realized. This study thereby not only provides a feasible electrochemical Li3N synthesis, but also delineates an economical and green synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing compounds from N2 under mild conditions, just using commercial spare parts and processes from the omnipresent Li battery technology.

         <title>Dewar Metallabenzenes from Reactions of Metallacyclobutadienes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Dewar benzene derivative was obtained over 60&#8197;years ago. The first hetero Dewar benzene with a p&#8208;block element (a 2&#8208;Dewar pyridine) was reported 45&#8197;years ago. The first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes have now been successfully prepared.







Abstract
Dewar benzenes, the metastable valence isomers of benzenes, have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast, little is known about Dewar metallabenzenes having a transition metal in the skeletal framework, despite the recent intensive interest in the development of chemistry of metallabenzenes. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of the first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes. These compounds were generated via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes.

         <title>Vacuum&#8208;Assisted Thermal Annealing of CsPbI3 for Highly Stable and Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vacuum&#8208;assisted thermal annealing approach is employed for the fabrication of CsPbI3 perovskite films with full surface coverage and enhanced crystallization. The resultant CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 20.06&#8201;%, along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Inorganic cesium lead iodide perovskite CsPbI3 is attracting great attention as a light absorber for single or multi&#8208;junction photovoltaics due to its outstanding thermal stability and proper band gap. However, the device performance of CsPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by the unsatisfactory crystal quality and thus severe non&#8208;radiative recombination. Here, vacuum&#8208;assisted thermal annealing (VATA) is demonstrated as an effective approach for controlling the morphology and crystallinity of the CsPbI3 perovskite films formed from the precursors of PbI2, CsI, and dimethylammonium iodide (DMAI). By this method, a large&#8208;area and high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film is obtained, exhibiting a much reduced trap&#8208;state density with prolonged charge lifetime. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency is raised from 17.26 to 20.06&#8201;%, along with enhanced stability. The VATA would be an effective approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film CsPbI3 perovskite optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Inorganic cesium lead iodide perovskite CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is attracting great attention as a light absorber for single or multi-junction photovoltaics due to its outstanding thermal stability and proper band gap. However, the device performance of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by the unsatisfactory crystal quality and thus severe non-radiative recombination. Here, vacuum-assisted thermal annealing (VATA) is demonstrated as an effective approach for controlling the morphology and crystallinity of the CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films formed from the precursors of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CsI, and dimethylammonium iodide (DMAI). By this method, a large-area and high-quality CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is obtained, exhibiting a much reduced trap-state density with prolonged charge lifetime. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency is raised from 17.26 to 20.06&#8201;%, along with enhanced stability. The VATA would be an effective approach for fabricating high-performance thin-film CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bonding in a Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Not &#963;&#8208;Aromatic But Still Unique</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High symmetry and unusual thermodynamic stability of the recently prepared and isolated crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster is determined by the unique multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding pattern (ThCl2)3 rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic Th3 bonding. The delocalized (ThCl2)3 bond extends the range of the charge&#8208;shift bonding beyond transition metals to a record seventh row of the periodic table.







Abstract
Very recently, Boronski et&#8197;al. reported the first thorium&#8211;thorium bond in a crystalline cluster prepared under normal experimental conditions. By using a range of experimental techniques and computational models, the authors found that the isolated actinide cluster contains at its heart two paired electrons delocalized over the tri&#8208;thorium ring. The recorded Raman spectrum allegedly confirmed the existence of a &#963;&#8208;aromatic three&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bond. In the following we demonstrate that the experimentally observed broad inelastic scattering bands between 60 and 135&#8197;cm&#8722;1, originally assigned by the authors to thorium&#8208;thorium vibrations, represent the combination of Th&#8722;Cl stretching and Th&#8722;Cl&#8722;Th bending modes, and they establish the existence of an unprecedented multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding (ThCl2)3 rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic bonding Th3. In the light of the presented findings, the latter remains experimentally unproven and computationally questionable.

         <title>Chiral Covalent Organic Framework Packed Nanochannel Membrane for Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To provide enantioselectivity in separation using nanochannel membranes, a nanochannel membrane was in situ packed with a chiral covalent organic framework (COF). The pore size of the COF matched the size of drug enantiomers. Compared with surface&#8208;modified nanochannels, the L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF packed nanochannels gave high enantioselectivity (94.2&#8201;%) and flux (1.33&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1), achieving an efficient enantioseparation for chiral drugs.







Abstract
A nanochannel membrane has the prospect of large&#8208;scale separation. However, selectivity in enantioseparation is a challenge, due to the size difference between nanochannels and enantiomers. Here, we compartmented nanochannels by the in situ synthesis of a L&#8208;tyrosine functionalized covalent organic framework (L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF). The L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF decreased the pore size of channels to match with naproxen enantiomers (S/R&#8208;NPX) and improved the enantioselective gating. In contrast to the surface&#8208;functionalized nanochannels (L&#8208;Tyr channel), the L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF packed nanochannels (L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF channel) exhibited high enantioselectivity for S&#8208;NPX and realized the enantioseparation with the enantiomer excess value up to 94.2&#8201;%. The separation flux through the highly porous L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF channel was 1.33&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This study provided a size&#8208;matching strategy and the chiral covalent organic framework packed nanochannel membrane to realize enantioseparation with high selectivity and flux.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Photoluminescent Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles by Electrostatic&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>

Fluorophore&#8208;free single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and Janus derivatives were synthesized on large scale by electrostatic&#8208;mediated intramolecular crosslinking, providing a powerful tool to selectively illuminate interfaces.







Abstract
We report the large&#8208;scale synthesis of photoluminescent single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) by electrostatic&#8208;mediated intramolecular crosslinking in a concentrated solution of 40&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 by continuous addition of the free radical initiator. Poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) was charged by quaternization with vinyl&#8208;imidazolium for the intramolecular crosslinking by using 2,2&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetophenone (DMAP) as the radical initiator. Under the electrostatic repulsion thus interchain isolation, the intrachain crosslinking experiences the transition from coil through pearl&#8208;necklace to globular state. The SCNPs demonstrate strong photoluminescence in the visible range when the non&#8208;emissive units are confined thereby. Composition and microstructure of the SCNPs are tunable. The photoluminescent tadpole&#8208;like Janus SCNP can be used to selectively illuminate interfacial membranes while stabilizing the emulsions.

         <title>Promising Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Birefringent Materials via Rational Design and Assembly of Planar &#960;&#8208;Conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] Functional Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylated &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] species were proposed for designing deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) birefringent materials. They show an enhanced polarizability anisotropy and HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap compared to the [BO3]3&#8722; and [B3O6]3&#8722; groups. Four DUV birefringent materials were successfully designed and synthesized under mild synthesis conditions by the assembly of planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] functional species.







Abstract
Birefringent materials play a significant role in modulating polarized light in optical communication and the laser industry. However, the discovery of deep ultraviolet (DUV, &#955;&lt;200&#8197;nm) birefringent materials still faces a serious challenge. Herein, we propose hydroxylated &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] units for designing DUV birefringent materials. Innovatively, four new hydroxyborates have been synthesized under mild synthesis conditions. They present four novel pseudo layers that benefit from the large degree of freedom assembly modes of [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] genes and large birefringence (0.057&#8211;0.123@532&#8197;nm). Moreover, the Cs3[B(OH)3]2Cl3 crystal features a short DUV cutoff edge (180&#8197;nm), which further indicates that the reported compounds are potential DUV birefringent crystals. Free and flexible assembly modes of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] groups endow them a particular advantage as significant genes for exploring promising DUV birefringent materials.

         <title>Hydrophilic Catalysts with High Activity and Stability in the Aqueous Polymerization of Ethylene to High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight&#8208;Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic sulfonated phosphinephenolato NiII catalysts are highly active and stable in aqueous ethylene polymerization, forming high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE) dispersions with narrow particle size distributions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble synthetic transition metal catalysts have been studied extensively for many reactions, but for olefin polymerization such catalysts have been lacking. We report herein a straightforward synthesis of phosphinephenolato NiII catalysts endowed permanently with a hydrophilic sulfonate moiety bound to the chelating ligand. These catalysts&#8217; hydrophilic active sites promote aqueous ethylene polymerization with high activity (TOF up to 6.3&#215;104&#8197;molEthylene&#8201;molNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) to high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE), with half&#8208;lives on the order of hours also at elevated temperatures. The obtained polyethylene dispersions feature narrow particle size distributions without any aggregates.

         <title>Tetrahedral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Networks: An A15&#8208;Like Frank&#8211;Kasper Phase Based on Rod&#8208;Packing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Frank&#8211;Kasper phase representing a tetrahedral network of molecular rods is reported. It is the topological dual to the Weaire&#8211;Phelan foam, being the Voronoi tessellation of the A15 sphere packing, from which this network is obtained by Delaunay triangulation.







Abstract
The Pm
n cubic and other low&#8208;symmetry Frank&#8211;Kasper phases are known to be formed by soft spheres, ranging from metals to block copolymer micelles and colloidal nanoparticles. Here, we report a series of X&#8208;shaped polyphiles composed of sticky rods and two non&#8208;symmetric branched side&#8208;chains, which self&#8208;assemble into the first example of a cubic liquid&#8208;crystalline phase representing a tetrahedral network of rods with a Pm
n lattice. It is the topological dual to the Weaire&#8211;Phelan foam, being the Voronoi tessellation of the A15 sphere packing, from which this network is obtained by Delaunay triangulation.

         <title>Doubling the Length of the Longest Pyrene&#8208;Pyrazinoquinoxaline Molecular Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iterative approach that allows doubling the length of the longest pyrene&#8208;pyrazinoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is reported. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach shows a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9&#8197;nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C276N48).







Abstract
Molecular nanoribbons are a class of atomically&#8208;precise nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. An iterative approach that allows doubling the length of the longest pyrene&#8208;pyrazinoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is described. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach&#8212;with a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9&#8197;nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C276N48)&#8212;shows an extremely high molar absorptivity (values up to 1&#8201;198&#8201;074&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) that also endows it with a high molar fluorescence brightness (8700&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>A Selenide Catalyst for the Activation of Alkenes through Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new selenide catalyst was discovered and fully characterized. It was shown to be highly efficient when applied to the catalysis of alkene transformations. Several examples using this weak interaction (Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) catalysis were demonstrated with, in particular, the possibility of intermolecular enyne cyclizations as well as cross&#8208;coupling of triple alkenes taking place.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding catalysis with divalent chalcogenides required using heteroatoms as electron donors to give reactivity, while the activation of hydrocarbons such as alkenes by this concept remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we discovered a powerful selenide catalyst that showed unprecedented capability in the activation of alkenes. The Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions were capable of catalyzing a broad range of transformations, including intermolecular cyclization and coupling reactions. Significantly, the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding activation mode can be exploited to achieve intermolecular enyne cyclizations and controlled cross&#8208;coupling of triple alkenes. The activation of alkenes by divalent selenides opens up a new avenue for supramolecular catalysis.

         <title>A Novel Catalytic Route to Polymerizable Bicyclic Cyclic Carbonate Monomers from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic approach for the preparation of polymerizable bicyclic carbonates allows the synthesis of a wide range of unique heterocycles. The stereochemical configuration of the epoxy alcohol substrate plays a crucial role, determining the chemoselectivity profile of this coupling manifold. The synthetic potential of these bicyclic six&#8208;membered carbonates was examined, and their successful ring&#8208;opening polymerization under mild conditions gives new incentives for relatively rigid polycarbonate architectures.







Abstract
A new catalytic route has been developed for the coupling of epoxides and CO2 affording polymerizable six&#8208;membered bicyclic carbonates. Cyclic epoxides equipped with a &#946;&#8208;positioned OH group can be transformed into structurally diverse bicyclic cyclic carbonates in good yields and with high selectivity. Key to the chemo&#8208;selectivity is the difference between the reactivity of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;configured epoxy alcohols, with the latter leading to six&#8208;membered ring carbonate formation in the presence of a binary AlIII aminotriphenolate complex/DIPEA catalyst. X&#8208;ray analyses show that the conversion of the syn&#8208;configured substrate evolves via a standard double inversion pathway providing a five&#8208;membered carbonate product, whereas the anti&#8208;isomer allows for activation of the oxirane unit of the substrate opposite to the pendent alcohol. The potential use of these bicyclic products is shown in ring&#8208;opening polymerization offering access to rigid polycarbonates with improved thermal resistance.

         <title>Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Pyrenophanes: Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence Based on a D2 Symmetry Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
D2&#8208;symmetric binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes have been synthesized with face&#8208;to&#8208;face pyrene rings. Matching the type and position of the linkers led to the pyrenophane exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence with a |glum| value reaching 0.053. This effect arose because of the D2 symmetry of the dye, which resulted in the binaphthyl moieties producing a unidirectionally twisting pyrene excimer with completely parallel electric and magnetic transition dipole moments.







Abstract
A series of D2&#8208;symmetric macrocycles composed of alternately linked pyrene and binaphthyl moieties (binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes) have been synthesized. Among them, a pyrenophane possessing ether linkers at the 2,7&#8208;positions of the pyrenes exhibited intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a |glum| value of 0.053. This value is by far the highest for excimers and was not sensitive to temperature, solvent, or concentration. The CPL originated from a twisting pyrene excimer, with the (R)&#8208;binaphthyl moieties producing a left&#8208;handed twist excimer, which exhibited (&#8722;)&#8208;CPL. The electric and magnetic transition dipole moments are perfectly parallel, which is the best relationship for strong CPL.

1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;Hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks of M3(HAT)2 (M=Fe, Ni, Co) were synthesized by means of an on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly protocol which effectively overcomes the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance.







Abstract
1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;Hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) is one of the smallest polyheterocyclic aromatic building blocks for forming conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs). However, the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance impedes the growth of HAT&#8208;based cMOFs. Here we employ on&#8208;surface synthesis to grow single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional cMOFs of M3(HAT)2 (M=Ni, Fe, Co). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) analysis, we resolve that the frameworks comprise a hexagonal lattice of HAT molecules and a Kagome lattice of metal atoms. The DFT analysis indicates that Ni, Co and Fe carry a magnetic moment of 1.1, 2.5, and 3.7&#8197;&#956;B, respectively. We anticipate that the small &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of HAT and strong bidentate chelating coordination give rise to appealing electronic and magnetic properties.

         <title>Amphiphilic Polycarbonate Micellar Rhenium Catalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction in aqueous media was achieved with amphiphilic polycarbonate micellar rhenium catalysts. Coordination polymers were prepared comprising amphiphilic micelles with tunable solubility in water. By adjusting the proportion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, the photocatalytic system was tailored to select for CO evolution.







Abstract
A triblock amphiphilic polymer derived from the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides containing a bipyridine rhenium complex in its backbone is shown to effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of CO2 to CO. This polymer provides uniformly spherical micelles in aqueous solution, where the metal catalyst is sequestered in the hydrophobic portion of the nanostructured micelle. CO2 to CO reduction occurs in an efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven process in aqueous media with turnover numbers up to 110 (&gt;99&#8201;% selectivity) in the absence of a photosensitizer, which is a 37&#8208;fold enhancement over the corresponding molecular rhenium catalyst in organic solvent. Notably, the amphiphilic polycarbonate micelle rhenium catalyst suppresses H2 generation, presumably by preventing deactivation of the active catalytic center by water.

Abstract
We have achieved the first anti&#8208;borylstannylation of alkynes by using (o&#8208;phenylenediaminato)borylstannanes. This reaction afforded 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;stannylalkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by a radical mechanism. This anti&#8208;addition manner is in sharp contrast to the syn&#8208;selectivity obtained during transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylstannylation. The mild radical conditions enabled a broad substrate scope, and various types of aromatic and aliphatic alkynes were applicable. The origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity was elucidated by DFT calculation of the reaction mechanism. The application of the borylstannylation products to cross&#8208; or homocoupling reactions provided ready access to either triarylethenes or bisborylbutadienes.

         <title>Expeditious Access to Morphinans by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benchmark chemical synthesis of codeine creates an opportunity to diversify essential opiate&#8208;medicine supply chains. The brevity of this approach derives from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot, while a subsequent photo&#8208;redox hydroamination protocol is deployed to provide a novel, atom&#8208;economical means for assembling the morphinan piperidine D&#8208;ring.







Abstract
Morphinans are essential medicines derived entirely from poppy supply chains rendered increasingly volatile by climate change. Here, we report a seven&#8208;step, asymmetric chemical synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;codeine from simple materials that requires a total combined reaction time of fewer than 24&#8197;hours. The efficiency of our approach arises from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot.

&lt;p&gt;A benchmark chemical synthesis of codeine creates an opportunity to diversify essential opiate-medicine supply chains. The brevity of this approach derives from a double-Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot, while a subsequent photo-redox hydroamination protocol is deployed to provide a novel, atom-economical means for assembling the morphinan piperidine D-ring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphinans are essential medicines derived entirely from poppy supply chains rendered increasingly volatile by climate change. Here, we report a seven-step, asymmetric chemical synthesis of (&#8722;)-codeine from simple materials that requires a total combined reaction time of fewer than 24&#8197;hours. The efficiency of our approach arises from a double-Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot. A subsequent photo-redox hydroamination protocol provides a novel, atom-economical means for assembling the piperidine D-ring of codeine. Simple modifications to the closing stages of our sequence offer effective access to pharmacologically valuable derivatives of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-demethyl codeine. Our work highlights the capacity for contemporary, stand-alone chemical synthesis regimes to diversify access to essential opiate medicines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Ammonium Ion Battery: A New Strategy for a Nonmetallic Ion Energy Storage System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic NH4+ ion batteries (OAIBs) with Prussian white (PW) as cathode and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) as anode in a non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte were successfully designed. The batteries deliver promising electrochemical performance, which opens a new field for organic nonmetallic ion batteries.







Abstract
Nonmetallic ammonium (NH4+) ion batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, which have the merit of low molar mass, sustainability, non&#8208;toxicity and non&#8208;dendrite. Herein, for the first time, we introduce the novel organic ammonium ion batteries (OAIBs). Significantly, a manganese&#8208;based Prussian white analogue (noted as MnHCF) as cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 104&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 98&#8201;% retention over 100&#8197;cycles. We further demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the NH4+ ion full cell, which delivers a reversible capacity of 45&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a broad electrochemical window. Combining ex situ XPS, ex situ XRD results and electrochemical properties, the NH4+ ion storage mechanism of MnHCF in a non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte is clearly revealed. This work verifies the feasibility of employing NH4+ ions as charge carriers in organic energy storage systems and provides new insights for designing organic nonmetallic ion batteries with broad electrochemical windows and high energy density.

         <title>A New Cation&#8208;Ordered Structure Type with Multiple Thermal Redistributions in Co2InSbO6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corundum&#8208;derived Co2InSbO6 undergoes an unprecedented sequence of cation rearrangements on heating, from a previously unreported ordered&#8208;R32 type distribution to two successive ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 type arrangements.







Abstract
Cation ordering in solids is important for controlling physical properties and leads to ilmenite (FeTiO3) and LiNbO3 type derivatives of the corundum structure, with ferroelectricity resulting from breaking of inversion symmetry in the latter. However, a hypothetical third ABO3 derivative with R32 symmetry has never been observed. Here we show that Co2InSbO6 recovered from high pressure has a new, ordered&#8208;R32 A2BCO6 variant of the corundum structure. Co2InSbO6 is also remarkable for showing two cation redistributions, to (Co0.5In0.5)2CoSbO6 and then Co2InSbO6 variants of the ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 A2BCO6 structure on heating. The cation distributions change magnetic properties as the final ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 product has a sharp ferrimagnetic transition unlike the initial ordered&#8208;R32 phase. Future syntheses of metastable corundum derivatives at pressure are likely to reveal other cation&#8208;redistribution pathways, and may enable ABO3 materials with the R32 structure to be discovered.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Assisted Hydrophobic Li+&#8208;Solvated Structure for Stabilizing Dual Electrode Electrolyte Interphases through Suppressing LiPF6 Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic Li+&#8208;solvated structure is developed by inducing hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate (HFAC) into electrolytes, which can not only physically block the contact between PF6&#8722; and trace H2O, but also help to form an organic&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase to alleviate the growth of Li dendrites and improve the structural stability of the Ni&#8208;rich cathode, resulting in improved cycling stability of Li&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high energy density. However, the hydrolysis of LiPF6 leads to uncontrollable Li dendrites growth and fast capacity fading. Herein, a hydrophobic Li+&#8208;solvated structure is designed by inducing the hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate into the electrolyte system. Due to the alkene groups and non&#8208;polar perfluorocarbon (&#8722;CF2CF2CF3) chain, a hydrophobic surface around Li&#8208;ion solvated aggregates can be obtained to protect the LiPF6 against the attack from trace H2O. Moreover, the additive could also help to form an organic solid electrolyte interphase with rich polar C&#8722;F bonds, which can capture Li ions to restrain the dendrite growth. Therefore, the Li||Li symmetric cells show a stable cycling performance up to 500&#8197;h at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells show good cycling stability, exhibiting a specific capacity of 111&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C with a capacity retention of 74&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>A Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complex Disrupts Actin Cytoskeleton Assembly and Blocks Cytokinesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dinuclear RuII complex [(Ru(phen)2)2(tpphz)]4+ binds to G&#8208;actin monomers, preventing assembly into F&#8208;actin. This inhibits actin fibre assemblies within live cells and causes disruption to late cytokinesis by interfering with the function of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) during abscission. These results reveal new possibilities for metal complexes as biomedical tools and novel therapeutic leads.







Abstract
The dinuclear RuII complex [(Ru(phen)2)2(tpphz)]4+ (phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, tpphz=tetrapyridophenazine) &#8220;RuRuPhen&#8221; blocks the transformation of G&#8208;actin monomers to F&#8208;actin filaments with no disassembly of pre&#8208;formed F&#8208;actin. Molecular docking studies indicate multiple RuRuPhen molecules bind to the surface of G&#8208;actin but not the binding pockets of established actin polymerisation inhibitors. In cells, addition of RuRuPhen causes rapid disruption to actin stress fibre organisation, compromising actomyosin contractility and cell motility; due to this effect RuRuPhen interferes with late&#8208;stage cytokinesis. Immunofluorescent microscopy reveals that RuRuPhen causes cytokinetic abscission failure by interfering with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complex recruitment.

In cells, addition of RuRuPhen causes rapid disruption to actin stress fibre organisation, compromising actomyosin contractility and cell motility; due to this effect RuRuPhen interferes with late-stage cytokinesis. Immunofluorescent microscopy reveals that RuRuPhen causes cytokinetic abscission failure by interfering with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complex recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Templated &#947;&#8208;Keggin Alkyltin&#8208;Oxo Cluster: Electronic Structure and Optical Limiting Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;templated Keggin structure, AgSn12, is prepared. The central Ag atom significantly influences the electronic structure and optical properties of the whole cluster, which have been investigated by theoretical calculations and Z&#8208;scan measurements.







Abstract
As one of the most representative polyoxometalate (POM) structures, Keggin clusters have attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;templated Keggin structure has not been reported to date. In this work, for the first time, a Ag atom was successfully incorporated to template the formation of a &#947;&#8208;Keggin alkytin&#8208;oxo cluster. Moreover, the central Ag atom has brought a significant heavy atom effect, showing the important influence on the electronic structure and optical properties. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Ag atom affects the frontier molecular orbitals and excited states of the AgSn12 cluster, and also the process of electron transfer. The solid structure of the AgSn12 cluster exhibits a significant third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and an excellent optical limiting effect has been experimentally verified. The success of this work opens the way for the construction and optical properties modulation of noble metal templated Keggin structures.

         <title>Anomalous Redox Features Induced by Strong Covalency in Layered NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2 Cathodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 27, July 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, anomalous redox features were found in NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2. The discharge potential is 0.2&#8197;V higher than that of undoped cathodes. It is speculated that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong covalency in the Ti&#8722;V&#8722;S system. Ti3+ and V3+ undergo charge transfer and form a more stable Ti (t2g0eg0) and V (t2g3eg0) electronic configuration.







Abstract
The rising demand for energy density of cathodes means the need to raise the voltage or capacity of cathodes. Transition metal (TM) doping has been employed to enhance the electrochemical properties in multiple aspects. The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, we found anomalous redox features in NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2. The first discharge platform potential (2.4&#8197;V) is significantly higher than that of undoped NaTiS2 and NaVS2 (both around 2.2&#8197;V), and the energy density is raised by 15&#8201;%. We speculate that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong hybridization in the Ti&#8722;V&#8722;S system. Ti3+ and V3+ undergo charge transfer and form a more stable Ti (t2g0eg0) and V (t2g3eg0) electronic configuration. Our results indicate that higher voltage of cathode materials could be achieved by strong TM&#8208;ligand covalency, and this conclusion provides possible opportunities to explore high voltage materials for future layered cathodes.

         <title>Data&#8208;driven Interpretable Descriptors for Structure&#8208;Activity Relation of Surface Lattice Oxygen on Doped Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the structure&#8208;activity relation of surface lattice oxygen is critical but challenging to design efficient redox catalysts. This paper describes data&#8208;driven redox activity descriptors on doped vanadium oxides combining density functional theory and interpretable machine learning. We corroborate p&#8208;band center is the most crucial feature about the activity. Besides, some features from the coordination environment, including unoccupied d&#8208;band center, s&#8208; and d&#8208;band fillings, also play important roles in tuning oxygen activity. Further analysis reveals that data&#8208;driven descriptors could decode more information about electron transfer during the redox process. Based on descriptors, we report that atomic Re&#8208; and W&#8208;doping could inhibit over&#8208;oxidation in chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which is verified by subsequent experiments and calculations. This work shed light on the structure&#8208;activity relation of lattice oxygen to design redox catalysts rationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Polymer&#8208;Cluster Interactions Enable Dramatic Thermal Stiffening Hydrogels for Mechanoadaptive Smart Fabrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermal stiffening materials that are naturally soft but adaptively self&#8208;strengthen upon heat are intriguing for load&#8208;bearing and self&#8208;protection applications at elevated temperatures. However, to simultaneously achieve high modulus change amplitude and high mechanical strength at the stiffened state remains challenging. Herein, entropy&#8208;mediated polymer&#8208;mineral cluster interactions are exploited to afford thermal stiffening hydrogels with a record&#8208;high storage modulus enhancement of 13,000 times covering a super wide regime from 1.3 kPa to 17 MPa. Such a dramatic thermal stiffening effect is ascribed to the transition from liquid&#8208;liquid to solid&#8208;liquid phase separations, and at the molecular level, driven by enhanced polymer&#8208;cluster interactions. The hydrogel was further processed into sheath&#8208;core fibers and smart fabrics, which demonstrated self&#8208;strengthening and self&#8208;powered sensing properties by co&#8208;weaving another liquid metal fiber as both the joule heater and triboelectric layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Photochemical 1,4&#8208;Bisalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene with Pd/Cu Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalysis by excited&#8208;state palladium has emerged as an active area of research, but controlling the enantioselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, we report the use of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis to accomplish the first three&#8208;component photochemical 1,4&#8208;bisalkylation reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. Consequently, &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing quaternary stereocenters were expeditiously synthesized from three simple starting materials: an alkyl bromide, butadiene, and an aldimine ester. Experimental and computational investigation of the reaction mechanism confirmed a radical pathway involving catalysis by an excited&#8208;state palladium species. The stereochemistry is mainly controlled by the chiral Cu catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>PlyAB Nanopores Detect Single Amino Acid Differences in Folded Haemoglobin from Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The real&#8208;time identification of protein biomarkers is crucial for the development of point&#8208;of&#8208;care and portable devices. Here, we use a PlyAB biological nanopore to detect haemoglobin (Hb) variants. Adult HbA and sickle cell anaemia HbS, which differ by just one amino acid, were distinguished in a mixture with more than 97&#160;% accuracy based on individual blockades. Foetal Hb, which shows a larger sequence variation, was distinguished with near 100&#160;% accuracy. Continuum and Brownian dynamics simulations revealed that Hb occupies two energy minima, one near the inner constriction and one at the  trans  entry of the nanopore. Thermal fluctuations, the charge of the protein, and the external bias influence the dynamics of Hb within the nanopore, which in turn generates the unique ionic current signal in the Hb variants. Finally, Hb was counted from blood samples, demonstrating that direct discrimination and quantification of Hb from blood using nanopores, is feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>An Adaptive Rhodium Catalyst to Control the Hydrogenation Network of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An adaptive catalytic system that provides control over the nitroarene hydrogenation network to prepare a wide range of aniline and hydroxylamine derivatives is presented. This system takes advantage of a delicate interplay between a rhodium(III) center and a Lewis acidic borane introduced in the secondary coordination sphere of the metal. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst in the presence of various potentially vulnerable functional groups and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to shed light on the mode of functioning of the catalyst and elucidate the origin of adaptivity.&#160;The competition for interaction with boron between a solvent molecule and a substrate was crucial for adaptivity. When operating in THF, the reduction network stops at the hydroxylamine platform, whereas the reaction can be directed to the aniline platform in toluene.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanobody&#8208;on&#8208;Quantum Dot Displacement Assay for Rapid and Sensitive Quantification of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosensing approaches that combine small engineered antibodies (nanobodies) with nanoparticles are often complicated. Here, we show that nanobodies with different C&#8208;terminal tags can be efficiently attached to a range of the most widely used biocompatible semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Direct implementation into simplified assay formats was demonstrated by designing a rapid and wash&#8208;free mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure immunoassay for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Terbium complex (Tb)&#8208;labeled hexahistidine&#8208;tagged nanobodies were specifically displaced from QD surfaces via EGFR&#8208;nanobody binding, leading to an EGFR concentration&#8208;dependent decrease of the Tb&#8208;to&#8208;QD F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal. The detection limit of 80&#177;20 pM (16&#177;4 ng/mL) was 3&#8208;fold lower than the clinical cut&#8208;off concentration for soluble EGFR and up to 10&#8208;fold lower compared to conventional sandwich FRET assays that required a pair of different nanobodies.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Membrane Transport in Polymeric Cell&#8208;Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant polymersomes are versatile and stable biomimetic compartments that are ideal for building cell&#8208;like systems. However, the transport of hydrophilic molecules across the membrane, which controls the function of cell&#8208;like systems, is limited by the low permeability of polymeric bilayers. Therefore, mechanisms to control the permeability of polymersomes are necessary to create functional cell&#8208;like systems. Here, we describe the design of giant polymersomes equipped with spiropyran&#8208;based permeability modulators. Photo&#8208;isomerization of the modulators leads to perturbation of the polymer membrane, resulting in increased permeability. The photoactivated polymersomes were used to construct two cell&#8208;like systems controlled by light&#8208;activated transport of hydrophilic molecules. First, we designed an enzymatic micro&#8208;reactor activated by light irradiation. Second, we constructed a hybrid coacervate&#8208;in&#8208;polymersome system that mimics the adaptive formation of biological condensates in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesityl&#8208;Functionalized Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescent Frameworks with Wide&#8208;range Color Tunability for Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters are promising for high color&#8208;purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, unlike the most common heteroatoms ternary&#8208;doped (X/B/N) frameworks, a binary&#8208;doped (B/N) skeleton is reported with large energy band for wide&#8208;range color tunability. Based on this parent&#8208;segment, an &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; catalyst&#8208;free borylation method is developed which generates deep&#8208;blue to pure green MR emitters from readily available starting materials, with peaks at 426&#8208;532 nm and full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maxima of 27&#8208;38 nm. Impressively, a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 40% is recorded for the corresponding device with Commission Internationale de l&#180;Eclairage coordinates of (0.14, 0.16), representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of B/N&#8208;doped MR emitters and will motivate the study of other novel frameworks.</dc:description>

Based on this parent-segment, an &#8220;one-pot&#8221; catalyst-free borylation method is developed which generates deep-blue to pure green MR emitters from readily available starting materials, with peaks at 426-532 nm and full-width-at-half-maxima of 27-38 nm. Impressively, a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 40% is recorded for the corresponding device with Commission Internationale de l&#180;Eclairage coordinates of (0.14, 0.16), representing the state-of-the-art performances. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of B/N-doped MR emitters and will motivate the study of other novel frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Tuned Rotation of Pyrazolyl Rings in a 2D Iron(II) Complex towards Synergetic Magnetic and Dielectric Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials showing synergy of magnetic and dielectric transitions are promising candidates for future molecular devices. The challenge is how to realize synergy between spin and dielectric transitions with responses to external stimuli. Herein, we design a 2D spin crossover (SCO) complex, [Fe  II  (dpa)][(pzTp)Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  2  (  1  ) (dpa = 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne and pzTp = tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate). The local structural changes about the Fe  II  ion were propagated to the whole crystal through the rigid bridging ligands (dpa), leading to elastic interactions to realize the abrupt SCO and rotational movements of polar apical pyrazolyl rings in the [(pzTp)Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  &#8722;  units. Dielectric measurements confirmed a substantial dielectric change (  &#916;&#949;'  = 2.3) upon the spin transition. This work provides a rational strategy to couple the spin transition and rotation of polar components, which is crucial for the synergetic switch of magnetism and dielectricity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel chiral Er complexes based on both enantiomers of extended iPrPyBox (2,6&#8208;Bis[4&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)]pyridine) show strong near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) within the 1400 to 1600 nm spectral region under 450 nm irradiation. CPL activity in this region, despite being particularly rare, would open the way to potential applications in the domain, e.g., of fiber&#8208;optic telecommunications and free&#8208;space long&#8208;distance optical communications employing circularly polarized light.

         <title>Homologous and Heterologous Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization from Exclusively Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the enticing issues of chiral origin has caused attractive topics: how chirality is born from the initial achiral units and the involved mechanisms for the transfer of chiral information. In this work, by combining physical vortex and seeds, a general process is revealed to generate chiral supramolecular polymers from achiral  C  3  &#8208;symmetric molecules. The symmetry&#8208;broken assemblies from the achiral molecules could work as chiral seeds to initiate the polymerization of either homologous or heterologous achiral monomers. Concomitantly, the fragmentation of polymer driven by the vortex in the nucleation&#8208;elongation model is confirmed to enlarge the domains of chiral nuclei and then guide the polymer to grow into the predominant helicity with a high reactivity ratio. Moreover, the chiral information of structure can be well stored in different forms of assemblies. These new polymerization modes will provide more meaningful guidance for the preparation of chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkynylation of Cyclic Amines by Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a mild and general method for C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of cyclic amines has been an ongoing challenge. In this work, we described the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkynylation of unactivated cyclic 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;benzamide under photo&#8208;irradiation by intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The employment of a new bisoxazoline diphenylamine ligand, in conjunction with 1,1'&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol, which significantly improved the reduction potential of the copper complex, was the key to success of this chemistry. Mechanistic and computational studies supported that the new copper complex served dual role as a photoredox and coupling catalyst, the reaction went through a radical process, and the intramolecular 1,5&#8208;HAT process was involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Apart from broad substrate scope including unprecedented benzocyclic amines, this method also showed excellent diastereoselectivity in 2&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amines via substrate control.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capturing radioactive iodomethane and its vapors is a major challenge due to its low adsorption capacity. Herein, we have developed for the first time a pyridine&#8208;entrapped elastic crosslinked polysulfate gel (pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS) as an efficient absorbent for iodomethane capture. Each pyridine&#8208;encased TPC&#8208;cPS network cell acts as a mini&#8208;reactor for salt formation between pyridine and iodomethane. The yield reaches up to 96.65% and traps saturated iodomethane vapor of 1.573 g  pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS  &#8722;1  (equivalent to 18.103 g g  TPC&#8208;cPS  &#8722;1  ), which is the highest capacity reported to date. Both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the unusual adsorption of polysulfate for polar aprotic organics can be attributed to the fact that the electrostatic interactions&#160;&#160;between the polar group (O=S=O) in the polymer backbone and the polar groups in the organic molecules fixed the solvent in the polymer matrix, while the van der Waals forces between the nonpolar groups in the polymer and molecules induced swelling.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chimeric Conjugate of Antibody and Programmable DNA Nanoassembly Smartly Activates T cell for Precise Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetically directing T&#8208;cell against tumor emerges as a promising strategy in immunotherapy, while it remains challenging to smartly engage T cells with tunable immune response. Herein, we report an intelligent molecular platform to engineer T&#8208;cell recognition for selective activation to potently kill cancer cells. To this end,&#160;we fabricated a hybrid conjugate that uses a click&#8208;type DNA&#8208;protein conjugation to equip the T cell&#8208;engaging antibody with two distinct programmable DNA nanoassemblies.  By integrating multiple aptameric antigen&#8208;recognitions within a dynamic DNA circuit, we achieved combinatorial recognition of triple&#8208;antigens on cancer cells for selective T&#8208;cell activation after high&#8208;order logic operation. Moreover, by coupling a DNA nanostructure, we precisely defined the valence of the antigen&#8208;binding aptamers to tune avidity, realizing effective tumor elimination  in vitro  and  in vivo.&#160;Together, we present a versatile and programmable strategy for synthetic immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl sulfides were shown to participate in thermal (3+2) cycloadditions with tethered alkynes. The resulting thiophenium ylide cycloadducts led to a variety of polysubstituted thiophenes by trapping with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tools in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. Herein, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.

         <title>Evolution and Single&#8208;Droplet Analysis of Fuel&#8208;Driven Compartments by Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics were used to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. The nucleation, growth, and dissolution of active coacervate&#8208;based droplets were investigated with this setup.







Abstract
Active droplets are a great model for membraneless organelles. However, the analysis of these systems remains challenging and is often limited due to the short timescales of their kinetics. We used droplet&#8208;based microfluidics to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets to overcome this challenge. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. We discovered that the fuel concentration dictates the formation of the coacervate&#8208;based droplets and their properties. We observed that coacervate&#8208;based droplets grow through fusion, decay simultaneously independent of their volume, and shrinkage rate scales with their initial volume. This method helps to further understand the regulation of membraneless organelles, and we believe the analysis of individual coacervate&#8208;based droplets enables future selection&#8208; or evolution&#8208;based studies.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Dynamic RGB (Red&#8208;Green&#8208;Blue) Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence in an Anti&#8208;Kasha Organic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic ultra&#8208;long persistence luminescent material with dynamic RGB&#8208;tunable and high&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) based on a triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative was designed and prepared for information encryption and decryption.







Abstract
Organic LPL (long&#8208;persistent luminescence) materials have sparked extensive research interest due to the ultralong&#8208;lived triplet states. Although numerous organic LPL materials have been reported, most of the triplet emission was static and monotonous. Therefore, LPL materials with dynamic triplet emission are urgently required. A triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative 1 with dynamic LPL was fabricated. The single&#8208;crystal structure shows that the abundant intermolecular interactions and small free volume restrict the molecular motion and avoid the quenchers. Spectral and theoretical calculations upheld the existence of multiple excited states in 1, and the migration of electrons between multiple excited states is very sensitive to external stimuli. By modulating the stimulus, the residence of electrons in different triplet states can be manipulated to achieve RGB LPL. Importantly, blue LPL was achieved by manipulating the anti&#8208;Kasha emission. And the red LPL can still be observed at high temperature.

         <title>Selective Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyser Based on Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline CeO2 Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective conversion of CH4 to C2H4 at the anode and the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser is presented. Well&#8208;defined interfaces were constructed that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of CH4 to C2H4 plays an important role in the light olefin industry. Here, we report the electrochemical conversion of CH4 to C2H4/C2H6 at the anode with the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser. We constructed well&#8208;defined interfaces that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths. We engineered the chemical states and flux of active oxygen species for the oxidation of CH4 at the anode by controlling voltage and temperature. We show the unprecedented C2 selectivity (C2H4 and C2H6) of &#8805;99.5&#8201;% at a CH4 conversion of &#8776;7&#8201;%. The electrolyser exhibits excellent durability without performance degradation being observed in a continuous operation of 100&#8197;hours. Our work enables a novel path for the selective conversion of CH4/CO2 into useful chemicals, and the technique of building well&#8208;defined interfaces may find potential applications in other fields.

The combination of proton&#8208;detected fast MAS NMR &gt;100&#8197;kHz and specific labelling schemes reveals the formerly invisible domain of the Hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid. Since the evasiveness of this domain lies in its dynamic behavior, it is expected that this methodology will be of use to characterize flexible domains in a wider range of proteins.







Abstract
Experimentally determined protein structures often feature missing domains. One example is the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of the hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid protein, a functionally central part of this assembly, crucial in regulating nucleic&#8208;acid interactions, cellular trafficking, nuclear import, particle assembly and maturation. However, its structure remained elusive to all current techniques, including NMR. Here we show that the recently developed proton&#8208;detected fast magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning solid&#8208;state NMR at &gt;100&#8197;kHz MAS allows one to detect this domain and unveil its structural and dynamic behavior. We describe the experimental framework used and compare the domain's behavior in different capsid states. The developed approaches extend solid&#8208;state NMR observations to residues characterized by large&#8208;amplitude motion on the microsecond timescale, and shall allow one to shed light on other flexible protein domains still lacking their structural and dynamic characterization.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Melanin&#8211;Protein&#8211;Fe/Cu Conjugates Derived from Norepinephrine as Reliable Models for Neuromelanin of Human Brain Locus Coeruleus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8211;protein conjugates derived from norepinephrine fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin were synthesized as soluble models of neuromelanin from human brain locus coeruleus. This pigment contains a significant amount of iron and copper. The synthetic models show that the two metals exhibit a strong tendency to remain coupled to each other in dinuclear or multinuclear aggregates.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble melanin&#8208;protein&#8208;Fe/Cu conjugates derived from norepinephrine and fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin are reliable models for neuromelanin (NM) of human brain locus coeruleus. Both iron and copper promote catecholamine oxidation and exhibit strong tendency to remain coupled in oligonuclear aggregates. The Fe&#8208;Cu clusters are EPR silent and affect the 1H NMR spectra of the conjugates through a specific sequence of signals. Derivatives containing only Fe or Cu exhibit different NMR patterns. The EPR spectra show weak signals of paramagnetic FeIII in conjugates containing Fe or mixed Fe&#8208;Cu sites due to small amounts of mononuclear centers. The latter derivatives exhibit EPR signals for isolated CuII centers. These features parallel the EPR behavior of NM from locus coeruleus. The spectral data indicate that FeIII is bound to the melanic fraction, whereas CuII is bound on the protein fibrils, suggesting that the Fe&#8208;Cu clusters occur at the interface between the two components of the synthetic NMs.

         <title>1,5&#8208;Allyl Shift by a Sequential Achmatowicz/Oxonia&#8208;Cope/Retro&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is discovered for allyl furfuryl alcohol through two&#8208;step sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement at room temperature, which could be considered as a Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann&#8208;forbidden formal [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. Mechanistically, it involves Achmatowicz rearrangement, oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement, and an unprecedented &#8220;retro&#8208;Achmatowicz&#8221; rearrangement.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Allyl and 1,2&#8208;allyl shifts through [3,3]&#8208; and [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements are well&#8208;established and widely used in organic synthesis. In contrast, 1,5&#8208;allyl shift through related [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is unknown because [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is thermally Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann forbidden. Herein, we report an unexpected discovery of a formal 1,5&#8208;allyl shift of allyl furfuryl alcohol through a 2&#8208;step sequential rearrangement. Mechanistically, this formal 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is achieved through a sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement: 1) Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring expansion), and 2) cascade oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement/retro&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement (ring contraction). This new 1,5&#8208;allyl shift method is demonstrated with &gt;20 examples and expected to find applications in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis and Visualization of Entangled 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Valency Stereoscopic Molecular Nodes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic molecular node is used synthesize two isoreticular 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy unravels their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating networks with a bcu topology. The unique pore architectures and strong binding sites enable excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The high&#8208;valency molecular node may lead to new 3D COF topologies.







Abstract
The structural diversity of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are limited as there are only a few choices of building units with multiple symmetrically distributed connection sites. To date, 4 and 6&#8208;connected stereoscopic nodes with Td, D3h, D3d and C3 symmetries have been mostly reported, delivering limited 3D topologies. We propose an efficient approach to expand the 3D COF repertoire by introducing a high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic node with a connectivity of eight, based on which two isoreticular 3D imine&#8208;linked COFs can be created. Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy allows the direct visualization of their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated bcu networks. These 3D COFs are endowed with unique pore architectures and strong molecular binding sites, and exhibit excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The introduction of high&#8208;valency stereoscopic nodes would lead to an outburst of new topologies for 3D COFs.

         <title>Optimizing Pt Electronic States through Formation of a Schottky Junction on Non&#8208;reducible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum nanoparticles are supported on different MOFs, including non&#8208;reducible ZIF&#8208;8 and reducible UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125. Unexpectedly, the Pt/ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits higher activity than Pt/UiO&#8208;66 and Pt/MIL&#8208;125 in the photocatalytic benzylamine oxidative coupling reaction. The different electron transfer behaviors among these photocatalysts lead to the highest Pt electron density on ZIF&#8208;8 toward O2 activation, accounting for its superior activity.







Abstract
Charge transfer between metal sites and supports is crucial for catalysis. Redox&#8208;inert supports are usually unfavorable due to their less electronic interaction with metal sites, which, we demonstrate, is not always correct. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are chosen to mimic inert or active supports for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and the photocatalysis is studied. Results demonstrate the formation of a Schottky junction between Pt and the MOFs, leading to the electron&#8208;donation effect of the MOFs. Under light irradiation, both the MOF electron&#8208;donation effect and Pt interband excitation dominate the Pt electron density. Compared with the &#8220;active&#8221; UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125 supports, Pt NPs on the &#8220;inert&#8221; ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit higher electron density due to the higher Schottky barrier, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity. This work optimizes metal catalysts with non&#8208;reducible supports, and promotes the understanding of the relationship between the metal&#8211;support interaction and photocatalysis.

The different electron transfer behaviors among these photocatalysts lead to the highest Pt electron density on ZIF-8 toward O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, accounting for its superior activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge transfer between metal sites and supports is crucial for catalysis. Redox-inert supports are usually unfavorable due to their less electronic interaction with metal sites, which, we demonstrate, is not always correct. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are chosen to mimic inert or active supports for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and the photocatalysis is studied. Results demonstrate the formation of a Schottky junction between Pt and the MOFs, leading to the electron-donation effect of the MOFs. Under light irradiation, both the MOF electron-donation effect and Pt interband excitation dominate the Pt electron density. Compared with the &#8220;active&#8221; UiO-66 and MIL-125 supports, Pt NPs on the &#8220;inert&#8221; ZIF-8 exhibit higher electron density due to the higher Schottky barrier, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity. This work optimizes metal catalysts with non-reducible supports, and promotes the understanding of the relationship between the metal&#8211;support interaction and photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An endo&#8208;Directing&#8208;Group Strategy Unlocks Enantioselective (3+1+2) Carbonylative Cycloadditions of Aminocyclopropanes</title>

         <dc:description>
An endo&#8208;directing group strategy enables enantioselective (3+1+2) cycloadditions that are triggered by carbonylative C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanes. These processes are rare examples of cycloadditions where C&#8722;C bond oxidative addition is enantiodetermining.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroxylation of Dihydrosilanes to Si&#8208;Chiral Silanols Catalyzed by In Situ Generated Copper(II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;mediated &#963;&#8208;metathesis with prochiral dihydrosilanes has been successfully leveraged to efficiently synthesize Si&#8208;chiral silanols as well as many other related Si&#8208;chiral skeletons. The reaction hinges on the continuous generation of catalytically active copper(II) species via single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation of copper(I) by alkyl halides and the efficient stereocontrol with multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective hydroxylation of prochiral dihydrosilanes with water is expected to be a highly efficient way to access Si&#8208;chiral silanols, yet has remained unknown up to date. Herein, we describe a strategy for realizing this reaction: using an alkyl bromide as a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidant for invoking CuII species and chiral multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for effective enantiocontrol. The reaction readily provides a broad range of Si&#8208;chiral silanols with high enantioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility. In addition, we manifest the synthetic potential by establishing two synthetic schemes for transforming the obtained products into Si&#8208;chiral compounds with high structural diversity. Our preliminary mechanistic studies support a mechanism involving SET for recruiting chiral CuII species as the active catalyst and its subsequent &#963;&#8208;metathesis with dihydrosilanes.

         <title>Functionalizable and Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastics from Chemoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Bio&#8208;renewable Bifunctional &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone</title>

         <dc:description>
The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP is presented. It can recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (ca. 96&#8201;%). P(MVL)ROP with high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties, which is comparable to isotactic polypropylene (PP) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE).







Abstract
It is a highly attractive strategy to develop chemically recyclable polymers to establish a circular plastic economy. Despite the recent advancements, chemically recyclable polymers still face challenges including high energy cost for polymer preparation or recycling, poor monomer recovery selectivity and efficiency as well as undesired material performance. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce exclusive functionalizable polyester using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained polyester with high molar mass exhibits good tensile strength comparable to that of some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained polyester can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a 96&#8201;% yield by thermolysis, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Overproduction of Biofuels in Microorganisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photo&#8208;biosynthesis system was constructed for the overproduction of jet fuel farnesene by interfacing engineered E.&#8197;coli with persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3). meso&#8208;Al2O3 with rich defects prolonged the lifetime of photo&#8208;excited electrons that were passed to E.&#8197;coli and improved the farnesene production by a factor of over 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories reinvigorate current industries by producing complex fine chemicals at low costs. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the main reducing power to drive the biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. However, insufficient intrinsic NADPH limits the productivity of microorganisms. Here, we report that supplying microorganisms with long&#8208;lived electrons from persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3) can elevate the NADPH level to facilitate efficient fine chemical production. The defects in meso&#8208;Al2O3 were demonstrated to be highly efficient in prolonging electrons&#8217; lifetime. The long&#8208;lived electrons in meso&#8208;Al2O3 can pass the material&#8211;microorganism interface and power the biosynthetic pathways of E.&#8197;coli to produce jet fuel farnesene. This work represents a reliable strategy to design photo&#8208;biosynthesis systems to improve the productivity of microorganisms with solar energy.

         <title>A Lattice&#8208;Matching Strategy for Highly Reversible Copper&#8208;Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. Benefiting from the high lattice matching between Cu anodes and Ni substrates, Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes exhibit superior deposition/striping reversibility, lower nucleation overpotential and uniform deposition on the Ni substrates in comparison with other typical substrates.







Abstract
Copper metal is an attractive anode material for aqueous rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (844&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good environmental compatibility and high earth abundance. However, the Cu anodes often suffer from poor deposition/stripping reversibility and nonuniform deposition during the charge/discharge process, degrading the lifetime of aqueous Cu&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. In such a strategy, Ni substrates that exhibit high lattice matching with Cu were selected to support the Cu anodes. The high lattice matching endows Cu anodes with high deposition/stripping reversibility, low nucleation overpotential as well as a uniform and dense electrodeposition on Ni substrates. Based on the Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes, the full cells paired with lead dioxide cathodes show a stable cycling behavior. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu electrodes in aqueous rechargeable batteries.

         <title>The Microscopic Diamond Anvil Cell: Stabilization of Superhard, Superconducting Carbon Allotropes at Ambient Pressure</title>

DAC&#8208;carbon: A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. The superhard sp3 carbon framework serves as a microscopic diamond anvil cell, in which the sp2 chains are compressed to establish metallicity and superconductivity.







Abstract
A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an sp3 carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel cis&#8208;polyacetylene chains. The distance between these sp2 carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well&#8208;nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the sp2 carbons being key contributors to the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The sp3 carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48&#8197;GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on&#8208;surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the sp2 versus sp3 carbon content, and by doping.

         <title>Relaxation of the Plant Cell Wall Barrier via Zwitterionic Liquid Pretreatment for Micelle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated DNA Delivery to Specific Plant Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery is presented. This strategy leverages the synergistic effects of a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid and an organelle&#8208;targeting micelle complex, allowing greatly augmented DNA delivery to target organelles, such as chloroplasts, in living plants.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of genes to specific plant organelles is a key challenge for fundamental plant science, plant bioengineering, and agronomic applications. Nanoscale carriers have attracted interest as a promising tool for organelle&#8208;targeted DNA delivery in plants. However, nanocarrier&#8208;mediated DNA delivery in plants is severely hampered by the barrier of the plant cell wall, resulting in insufficient delivery efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique strategy that synergistically combines a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) with a peptide&#8208;displaying micelle complex for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery in plants. We demonstrated that ZIL pretreatment can enhance cell wall permeability without cytotoxicity, allowing micelle complexes to translocate across the cell wall and carry DNA cargo into specific plant organelles, such as nuclei and chloroplasts, with significantly augmented efficiency. Our work offers a novel concept to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for nanocarrier&#8208;mediated cargo delivery to specific organelles in living plants.

         <title>Amine&#8208;directed Formation of B&#8211;N Bonds for BN&#8208;fused Polycyclic Aromatic Multiple Resonance Emitters with Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable multiple resonances (MR) optoelectronic properties of  organic nanographenes  with boron and  nitrogen atoms disposed  para  to each other, the synthetic procedures are sophisticated with low yields and the molecular skeletons are limited. Here, a new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access MR emitter is constructed by simplifying the  multiborylation  through the amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8208;N bonds while introducing  an additional  para  &#8208;positioned nitrogen atom to trigger the MR effect  . The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecules exhibit narrowband emissions at 480 and 490 nm, with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of only 29 and 34 nm. The devices based on them showed external quantum efficiencies (EQE) values &gt;33.0%, which remained to exceed 24.0% even at a high brightness of 5000 cd m  &#8722;2  . This is the first example of MR emitters with B&#8208;N covalent bond, not only decreasing the synthesis difficulty but also increasing the diversity of MR skeletons for emerging new optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermophoretic AND Gate Operation on Extracellular Vesicles Improves Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a valuable source of cancer biomarkers. However, the high degree of EV heterogeneity and the complexity of clinical samples pose a challenge in the sensitive identification of tumor&#8208;derived EVs. Here we introduce a one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay that integrates polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs and simultaneous AND gate operation on EV membranes by dual&#8208;aptamers recognition. By using the Tango assay to detect tumor&#8208;derived EVs with&#160;co&#8208;presence&#160;of EpCAM and PSMA directly from serum in a homogeneous, separation&#8208;free format, we can discriminate prostate cancer (PCa) patients from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients in the diagnostic gray zone with an accuracy of 91 % in 15 min. Our approach streamlines EV enrichment and AND gate operation on EVs in a single assay, providing a rapid, straightforward, and powerful method for precise and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Cis&#8208;Trans Reisomerization Precedes Reprotonation of the Retinal Chromophore in the Photocycle of Schizorhodopsin 4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent discoveries of light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins have opened new avenues to exploring the mechanism of unidirectional transport because these proteins transport protons in the opposite direction to conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, despite their similar protein structure and membrane topology. Schizorhodopsin (SzR) is a newly discovered rhodopsin family of light&#8208;driven inward proton pumps. Here, we report time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectra showing that cis&#8208;trans thermal reisomerization precedes reprotonation at the Schiff base of the retinal chromophore in the photocycle of SzR AM_5_00977. This sequence has not been observed for the photocycles of conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, in which reisomerization follows reprotonation, and thus provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping. The present findings are expected to contribute to controlling the direction of proton transport in engineered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Platinum(II) Tweezers and a Guest System: From Discrete Molecules to High&#8208;Ordered Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of platinum(II) calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular tweezers was synthesized. The studies of the host&#8208;guest association with a charge&#8208;neutral cyclometalated platinum(II) complex showed a drastic color change and the turning on of near&#8208;infrared emission resulting from Pt&#8943;Pt and &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions. Control of the host&#8208;guest assembly process by varying the solvent composition can lead to a change from discrete host and guest molecules to high&#8208;ordered host&#8208;guest oligomers with the formation of sheet&#8208;like nanostructures, demonstrating a rare example of three&#8208;state supramolecular host&#8208;guest system with high solubility in solvents of diverse polarity. The change in host&#8208;guest assembly behaviors could be probed by drastic color changes from yellow to orange to green. The present study provides insights into the systematic design of solvent&#8208;responsive molecular materials using molecular tweezers&#8208;directed host&#8208;guest assembly, with potential applications in colorimetric sensing of changes in the micro&#8208;environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Crystalline Coordination Catalyst for Hybrid Electrocatalytic Full Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid CO  2  electroreduction in which carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is coupled with a thermodynamically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction is recognized as a very important strategy to improve the total value of redox products and energy conversion efficiency. In this work, a coordination catalyst model system for hybrid electrocatalytic full reaction, including Ni  8  &#8208;TET with active oxidation sites, Ni&#8208;TPP with active reduction sites and PCN&#8208;601 with redox&#8208;active sites, was established for the first time. Compared with the other two compounds, PCN&#8208;601 can complete both anodic methanol oxidation reaction and cathodic CO  2  RR with FE  HCOOH  and FE  CO  over 90%. Furthermore, due to the photosensitivity of metalloporphyrins, the performances of PCN&#8208;601 can be further improved with light irradiation (FE  HCOOH  over 90% at 1.8 &#8208; 2.5 V and FE  CO  nearly 100% at 2 &#8208; 2.4 V), which is the first crystalline coordination catalyst that can complete oxidation and reduction reactions, simultaneously. DFT calculation shows that the electrons transferring from Ni  8  clusters to Ni ions in the porphyrin under electric fields results in the raised oxidability of Ni  8  clusters and raised reducibility of metalloporphyrin, which is responsible for the improved electrocatalytic performance of PCN&#8208;601. Significantly, it is the first report to use one crystalline coordination catalyst to achieve the hybrid electrocatalytic full reaction. Moreover, this work serving as a well&#8208;defined model system puts forward a new design idea for establishing efficient catalysts for hybrid CO  2  electroreduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Ammonia Activation Through Coordination Induced Bond Weakening in Molybdenum Complexes of a Dianionic Pentadentate Ligand Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia oxidation catalyzed by molecular compounds is of current interest as a carbon free source of dihydrogen. Activation of N&#8208;H bonds through coordination to transition metal centers is a key reaction in this process. We report the substantial activation of ammonia  via  reaction with low valent molybdenum complexes of a diborate pentadentate ligand system. Spontaneous loss of hydrogen atoms from (B  2  Pz  4  Py)Mo(II)&#8208;NH  3  at room temperature to produce H  2  and the dinuclear &#956;&#8208;nitrido compound (B  2  Pz  4  Py)Mo&#8208;N&#8208;Mo(B  2  Pz  4  Py) is observed due to substantial N&#8208;H bond weakening upon coordination to Mo. Mechanistic details are supported through the experimental observation/characterization of terminal amido, imido and nitrido complexes and density functional theory computations. The generally under&#8208;appreciated role of bridging nitrido intermediates is revealed and discussed, providing guidance for further catalyst development for this process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Recently the fruitful merger of organoboron chemistry and photocatalysis has come to the forefront of organic synthesis resulting in the development of new technologies to access complex (non)borylated frameworks. Central to the success of this combination is control of boron hybridisation. Contingent on the photoactivation mode, boron as its neutral planar form or tetrahedral boronate can be used to regulate reactivity. This minireview highlights the current state of the art in photocatalytic processes utilising organoboron compounds paying particular attention to the role of boron hybridisation for the target transformation.</dc:description>

The magneto&#8208;orientation of MDSs originates from the unique structure with g&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles sandwiched by two silicate nanosheets. The resultant gels not only exhibit anisotropic optical and mechanical properties but also show anisotropic responses to temperature and light. Gels with complex ordered structures of MDSs are further devised by multi&#8208;step magnetic orientation and photolithographic polymerization. These gels show varied birefringence patterns with potentials as information materials, and can deform into specific configurations upon stimulations. Multi&#8208;gait motions are further realized in the patterned gel through dynamic deformation under spatiotemporal light and friction regulation by imposed magnetic force. The magneto&#8208;orientation assisted fabrication of hydrogels with anisotropic structures and additional functions should bring opportunities for gel materials in biomedical devices, soft actuators/robots, etc.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report here fast A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange between APbX  3  perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) made of different A&#8208;cations (Cs (Cesium), FA (formamidinium), and MA (methylammonium)) at room temperature. Surprisingly, the A&#8208;cation cross&#8208;exchange proceeds as fast as the halide (X=Cl, Br, or I) exchange with the help of free A&#8208;oleate complexes present in the freshly prepared colloidal perovskite NC solutions. It enabled the preparation of double (MACs, MAFA, CsFA)&#8208; and triple (MACsFA)&#8208;cation perovskite NCs with an optical bandgap that is finely tunable by their A&#8208;site composition. The optical spectroscopy together with structural analysis using XRD and atomically resolved high angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) STEM indicates the homogeneous distribution of different cations in the mixed perovskite NC lattice.

         <title>Explaining Regio&#8208;Divergent Vinylations with Vinylbenziodoxolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylbenziodoxolones have recently been identified as efficient hypervalent iodine(III) reagents for electrophilic vinylations under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Their unique reactivity allows synthesis of either internal or terminal alkenes, depending on the nucleophile class. This paper constitutes the first mechanistic investigation of VBX vinylations, and makes use of NMR studies, deuterium labelling and computations to rationalize the observed regio&#8208; and stereochemical outcome. Internal alkene formation in S&#8208;vinylation was found to proceed through the ligand coupling mechanism typical of diaryliodonium salts, whereas terminal alkene formation in P&#8208;vinylations took place via a phosphinous acid&#8208;coordinated VBX complex, which underwent concerted deprotonation and Michael&#8208;type addition. Subsequent base&#8208;assisted protonation and E2 elimination delivered the terminal alkene. The findings can be used to predict the regioselectivity in vinylations of other nucleophile classes.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence and Length Control in Nonchelated d8&#8208;Metallosupramolecular Polymers through Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) of d  8  transition metal complexes have received considerable attention by virtue of their rich photophysical properties arising from metal&#8208;metal interactions. However, thus far, the molecular design is restricted to complexes with chelating ligands due to their advantageous preorganization and strong ligand fields. Herein, we demonstrate unique pathway&#8208;controllable metal&#8208;metal&#8208;interactions and remarkable  3  MMLCT luminescence in SPs of a non&#8208;chelated Pt  II  complex. Under kinetic control, self&#8208;complementary bisamide H&#8208;bonding motifs induce a rapid self&#8208;assembly into non&#8208;emissive H&#8208;type aggregates (  1A  ). However, under thermodynamic conditions, a more efficient ligand coplanarization leads to superiorly stabilized SP  1B  with extended Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions and remarkably long  3  MMLCT luminescence (&#964;  77 K  = 0.26 ms). The metal&#8208;metal interactions could be subsequently exploited to control the length of the emissive SPs using the seeded&#8208;growth approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aldehydes and Ketones by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation of aldehydes and ketones via their readily prepared silyl enol ethers has been achieved by dual nickel and photoredox catalysis. This reaction features broad scope and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalization of ketones and aldehydes has been intensively explored in organic synthesis. The functionalization of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in such carbonyl compounds is less well investigated and developing a general method for their &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation remains challenging. Herein we report a method that uses cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis for the formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aldehydes and ketones with (hetero)aryl bromides. The method features mild conditions, remarkable scope and wide functional group tolerance. Importantly, the introduced synthetic strategy also allows the &#946;&#8208;alkenylation, &#946;&#8208;alkynylation and &#946;&#8208;acylation of aldehydes under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that this transformation proceeds through a single electron oxidation/Ni&#8208;mediated coupling/reductive elimination cascade.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Multifunctional &#960;&#8208;Conjugated P&#8208;Heterocycles Featuring an Internal Ylidic Bond
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple synthesis of P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond is reported. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization (direct arylation) and the strategy is also compatible with the preparation of polyaromatic scaffolds (acenes, helicenes). Molecular engineering allows tuning the optical and redox properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.







Abstract
We report the straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;membered P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond: P&#8208;containing acenaphthylenes and phenanthrenes. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization through direct arylation to introduce electron&#8208;rich/poor substituents and the synthetic strategy is also compatible with the preparation of more elaborate polyaromatic scaffolds such as acenes and helicenes. Using a joint experimental (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical approach, we perform a full structure&#8211;property relationships study on these new platforms. In particular, we show that molecular engineering allows not only tuning their absorption/emission across the entire visible range but also endowing them with chiroptical or non&#8208;linear optical properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Fe2+/Fe3+ Cycling for Coupling Self&#8208;Powered Hydrogen Evolution and Preparation of Electrode Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling system has been established for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution, in which a Zn&#8722;Fe battery with Fe3+ reduction reaction coupled Zn oxidation powers the electrolyzers of Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR) coupled hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling is used to prepare a multifunctional catalyst by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on siloxene nanosheets.







Abstract
A novel Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery featuring an Fe3+ reduction reaction (Fe3+RR)&#8208;coupled zinc oxidation, and an Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system as well, was established. This battery is capable of driving two Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER systems in series based on the above Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling, for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling enables the preparation of a multifunctional catalyst, Pt&#8208;3@SXNS (siloxene nanosheet), by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on SXNS; alternatively, this support could be obtained by Fe3+RR&#8208;assisted exfoliation using Fe3+ from the anolyte of Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER. The Pt&#8208;3@SXNS catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities toward Fe3+RR in the Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery, HER, and Fe2+OR in the electrolyzer, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Si. This work offers a new strategy for energy storage and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from acidic wastewater.

         <title>Accelerated Degradation of Microplastics at the Liquid Interface of Ice Crystals in Frozen Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally rapid degradation of microplastics (MPs) in frozen solution was discovered. The activity is ascribed to selective generation of singlet oxygen in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals. The findings offer a highly efficient degradation pathway for MPs and shed light on mechanisms of disposal of MPs in nature.







Abstract
Microplastics (MPs) are one of the emerging contaminants in environmental media, and they have raised great concern because they are resistant to degradation and persist in ecosystems. Although numerous advanced technologies have been developed, suitable technologies are still lacking for degradation of widespread MPs in the natural environment. We have discovered that MPs can be degraded exceptionally rapidly in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (3PS*) in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce singlet oxygen (1O2). The 1O2 boosts PS oxidation in the liquid layer thus further causing accelerated degradation at freezing temperature. This finding offers a highly efficient pathway for degradation of MPs and it sheds light on an unusual MPs disposal mechanisms in nature.

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Porous Organic Polymer Films for High&#8208;Performance Memristors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical preparation of porous organic polymer films for high&#8208;performance memristors is presented. This work will stimulate the development of porous organic polymer films in the field of advanced electron devices.







Abstract
Porous organic polymer films (PFs) with intrinsical porosity and tuneable pore environment are ideally suited for application in electronic devices. However, the huge challenges still exist for construction of electronic devices based on PFs owing to lack of robustness, processability, and controllable preparation. Herein, we report the electrochemical preparation of carbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer films (eCPFs) as switchable materials for the memristors. These eCPFs possess the characteristics of controllable thickness/size, high stability, and excellent porosity. Carbazole and cyano groups are introduced into the eCPFs to constructing electron transfer systems. Thus, the memristors constructed based on these eCPFs exhibit excellent switching performance, reliability, and reproducibility. The electrochemically controllable preparation method of porous organic polymer membranes proposed in this paper provides a feasible idea for the developments of electronic devices.

         <title>Ball Milling Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Prussian Blue Analogue Na2&#8722;xMnFe(CN)6 Cathodes for All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, cost&#8208;efficient, and general programmable ball&#8208;milling synthesis process without any additives was designed to prepare highly crystalline MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170. The constructed sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) based on the above MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170 can adapt to the complex and fickle working environment, and demonstrate possible practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.







Abstract
With a series of merits, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been considered as superior cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Their commercialization, however, still suffers from inferior stability, considerable [Fe(CN)6] defects and interstitial water in the framework, which are related to the rapid crystal growth. Herein, a &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air&#8208;stability, all&#8208;climate, and full&#8208;cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water&#8208;based co&#8208;precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques. This work could pave the way for the PBA&#8208;based SIBs in grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Nitric&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Releasing aza&#8208;BODIPY: A New Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent attachment of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties to aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives affords the first NO&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate of BDP&#8208;NO. The delicate modulation of the aggregation states of BDP&#8208;NO enables different antibacterial modalities, and the combination of NO release and photothermal therapy (PTT) can synergistically treat MRSA infections while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammatory responses.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) J&#8208;aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine&#8208;containing aza&#8208;BODIPY precursor (BDP&#8208;NH2), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate (BDP&#8208;NO). The introduction of N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of BDP&#8208;NH2, which instead promotes the formation of J&#8208;aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of &#8776;109&#8197;nm to the NIR window (820&#8197;nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of BDP&#8208;NO within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammation for the in vivo treatment of MRSA infection.

Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of &lt;b&gt;BDP-NO&lt;/b&gt; within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT-associated inflammation for the in vivo treatment of MRSA infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cochlearol&#8197;B by an Approach Based on a Catellani Reaction and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled [2+2] Cycloaddition

A 14&#8208;step approach to (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. The strategy involves an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation, Catellani reaction, and visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] cycloaddition to rapidly access the core of this natural product. Careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions, and [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;step synthesis of (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. This renoprotective meroterpenoid features a unique core structure containing a densely substituted cyclobutane ring with three stereocenters. Our strategy employed an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation in route to the key chromenyl triflate. A subsequent Catellani reaction incorporated the remaining carbon atoms featured in the skeleton of cochlearol&#8197;B. An ensuing visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition closed the cyclobutane and formed the central bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane core. Notably, careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions and [4+2] cycloadditions.

         <title>Highly Active Si Sites Enabled by Negative Valent Ru for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in LaRuSi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike other Ru&#8208;containing compounds whose active sites are Ru sites, the Si sites in LaRuSi function as real active sites. The unusual negative valence Ru in this compound has excessively tight adsorption for hydrogen, according to both theoretical calculations and in situ Raman observations, but the Si sites have excellent hydrogen adsorption properties.







Abstract
The discovery and identification of novel active sites are paramount for deepening the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and driving the development of remarkable electrocatalysts. Here, we reveal that the genuine active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in LaRuSi are Si sites, not the usually assumed Ru sites. Ru in LaRuSi has a peculiar negative valence state, which leads to strong hydrogen binding to Ru sites. Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063&#8197;eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge due to the complicated structural characteristics of antibodies. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this traceless, one&#8208;step method, we successfully synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both  in vitro  and  in vivo  anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes. The current work presents a robust, traceless, site&#8208;specific antibody functionalization via a self&#8208;releasing strategy, and offers a novel acyl transfer design for broad potential application in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with unique compositional and structural tunability appear as an emerging class of luminescent materials, but near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters therein are largely unexplored to date.

Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory calculation analysis demonstrate that the emissions originate from the highly localized excitons, and the confined [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in these structures show low symmetry and a large degree of structural freedom.

         <title>DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machines for spatially resolved searching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repurposing the RNA&#8208;guided endonuclease Cas9 to develop artificial CRISPR molecular machines represents a new direction toward synthetic molecular information processing. The operation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9&#8208;based machines, nevertheless, relies on the molecular recognition of freely diffused sgRNA/Cas9, making it practically challenging to perform spatially regulated localized searching or navigation. Here, we develop a DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machine that can perform spatially resolved DNA cleavage via either free or localized searching modes. When triggered at a specific site on the DNA origami with nanoscale accuracy, the free searching mode leads to searching activity that gradually decays with the distance, whereas the localized mode generates spatially&#8208;confined searching activity. Our work expands the function of CRISPR molecular machines and lays foundations to develop integrated molecular circuits and high&#8208;throughput nucleic acid detection.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The application of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers presents a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular crowding conditions within cells diminish the potency of current G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Herein, chiral Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(II) dinuclear complexes were developed as highly potent G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers even under challenging molecular crowding conditions. The compounds were encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages to enhance sub&#8208;cellular localization and provide cancer selectivity. The nanoparticles were able to efficiently inhibit the endogenous activities of telomerase in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells and cause cell death by apoptosis. The nanomaterials demonstrated high antitumor activity towards cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells as well as tumor&#8208;bearing mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first example of a Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(II) dinuclear complex as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer with an anti&#8208;cancer effect towards drug&#8208;resistant tumors inside an animal model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Intramolecular chlorine&#8208;sulfur (Cl&#8208;S) non&#8208;covalent interaction is introduced to modify the molecular backbone of a benchmark small&#8208;molecule donor (SMD) BTR to help planarize the molecular framework for improving charge transport. Theoretical simulations and temperature&#8208;variable NMR experiments clearly validate the existence of Cl&#8208;S non&#8208;covalent interaction in BP&#8208;Cl and BM&#8208;Cl and explain its important role in enhancing planarity and rigidity of the molecules for enhancing their crystallinity. Moreover, the asymmetric isomerization of side&#8208;chains by shifting the alkyl group from  para  &#8208; to  meta  &#8208;position on the phenyl ring further optimizes the molecular orientation and surface energy of BM&#8208;Cl to strike a balance between its crystallinity and miscibility. This carefully manipulated molecular design helps result in increased carrier mobility and suppressed charge recombination to obtain simultaneously enhanced  J  SC  and FF and a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.73% in binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;Field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanoplatform is developed as a Mn reservoir that exhibits efficient storage, specific delivery and accurate release of Mn ions for high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. Such a smart nanoplatform can exert a responsive imaging signal in dual&#8208;mode (T1&#8208; or T2&#8208;weighted) high&#8208;field MRI, which enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of Mn release within the tumor microenvironment and of ferroptosis initiation.







Abstract
Ferroptosis exhibits potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and the lack of reliable imaging for monitoring the ferroptosis process in living systems. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within the tumor to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, produce O2 and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts a responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T1&#8208;/T2&#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to store, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.

         <title>Alkyl/Glycosyl Sulfoxides as Radical Precursors and Their Use in the Synthesis of Pyridine Derivatives
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides are shown to be suitable precursors to radicals. Alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which, upon visible&#8208;light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to give various pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
We report here the use of simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides as precursors to radicals and their application in the preparation of pyridine derivatives. We show that alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes in solution, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to afford various pyridine derivatives smoothly. This reaction displays broad scope with respect to both sulfoxides and N&#8208;methoxy pyridiniums. The synthetic versatility of sulfoxides as a handle in chemistry adds to their power as radical precursors. Glycosyl sulfoxides are converted to the corresponding pyridyl C&#8208;glycosides with high stereoselectivities. Computational and experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclopentyl Boronic Esters Bearing Contiguous Fully Substituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes enables the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecules bearing two or more contiguous, quaternary stereocenters is challenging, owing to the difficulty in controlling stereochemistry whilst simultaneously constructing a sterically congested motif. Herein, we report the electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes for the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with high levels of stereocontrol. Remarkably, simple variation of the reaction solvent enabled their diastereodivergent construction with facile access to complementary diastereomeric pairs. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scanning Potential&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated the first fast&#8208;scanning potential&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (FSP&#8208;OECT) for in vivo dopamine (DA) sensing, featuring high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. It was successfully applied for in vivo DA sensing at low basal levels as well as the electrically stimulated release of DA.







Abstract
Developing techniques for the highly sensitive assay of neurotransmitters is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast&#8208;scanning potential (FSP)&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT): for the highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain. The configuration combines the selectivity of fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with the high sensitivity of an OECT. The combined use of FSP as a gating mode and transconductance (gm) as a sensing parameter further improve the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, reproducibility, and stability. The FSP&#8208;OECT exhibits a sensitivity of 0.899&#8197;S&#8201;M&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection down to 5&#8197;nM and was validated for in vivo monitoring of the basal level and electrically stimulated release of DA.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu+ via Strong Electronic Interaction for Selective and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong electronic interactions between hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and Cu2O protect the Cu&#8722;O bonds against electron attack through the transfer of accumulated electrons from Cu2O to h&#8208;BN. This effect stabilizes the active Cu+ species during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Copper oxide&#8208;based materials effectively electrocatalyze carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). To comprehend their role and achieve high CO2RR activity, Cu+ in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu2O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu+. The C2H4/CO ratio increased 1.62&#8208;fold in the CO2RR with Cu2O&#8722;BN compared to that with Cu2O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu2O&#8722;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8722;O bonds. Electrophilic h&#8208;BN receives partial electron density from Cu2O, protecting the Cu&#8722;O bonds from electron attack during the CO2RR and stabilizing the Cu+ species during long&#8208;term electrolysis. The well&#8208;retained Cu+ species enhanced the C2 product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu2O&#8722;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal&#8208;valence&#8208;state&#8208;dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Metathesis Reactions of a NHC&#8208;Stabilized Phosphaborene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable compounds with a genuine B=P double bond are rare and have limited applications given their protecting groups&#8242; bulky nature. The preparation of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene with a B=P double bond and a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal is reported, which exhibits an unprecedented ability for B=P&#8208;unit transfer reactions, allowing the isolation of B=P&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
The BP unsaturated unit is a very attractive functional group as it provides novel reactivity and unique physical properties. Nonetheless, applications remain limited so far due to the bulky nature of B/P&#8208;protecting groups, required to prevent oligomerization. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene, bearing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal, as a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable crystalline solid accessible via facile NHC&#8208;induced trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) elimination from its phosphinoborane precursor. This phosphaborene compound, bearing a genuine B=P bond, exhibits a remarkable ability for undergoing P&#8208;centre metathesis reactions, which allows the isolation of a series of unprecedented phosphaborenes. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations provide insights into the B=P bonding situation.

Abstract
A critical step in advancing the practical application of copper&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to bridge the large gap between device efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance. Described is a panel of air&#8208; and thermally stable two&#8208;coordinate CuI emitters featuring bulky pyrazine&#8208; (PzIPr) or pyridine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PyIPr*) and carbazole (Cz) ligands with enhanced amide&#8208;Cu&#8208;carbene bonding interactions. These CuI emitters display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from the 1LL&#8242;CT(Cz&#8594;PzIPr/PyIPr*) excited states across the blue to red regions with exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Vapour&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on these CuI emitters showed excellent external quantum efficiencies and luminance up to 23.6&#8201;% and 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, alongside record device lifetimes (LT90) up to 1300&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 under our laboratory conditions, highlighting the practicality of the CuI&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Back&#8208;Gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;Tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microcell&#8208;based in&#8197;situ electronic/electrochemical system was designed to unlock the fixed charge transfer of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction under an electric field. The charges across the van der Waals (vdW) channel distribute to three Mo atoms adjacent to S vacancies and strengthen Mo&#8722;H bonding. The catalyst design enables precise regulation of the electronic configuration.







Abstract
Charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Establishing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies beyond conventional methods. We describe exertion of an external electric field in the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the band gap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. In&#8197;situ photoluminescence spectra and gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement reveal a linear correlation between the charge accumulation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. This approach provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Mapping of Efficient Chiral Induction by Helicene&#8208;Type Additives in Copolymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special class of helicene&#8208;type additives, which are straightforward to synthesize in large amounts, induce strong chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films. Advanced chirality&#8208;sensitive microscopy techniques and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods based on transient circular dichroism and transient circularly polarized luminescence reveal the supramolecular origin of the chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We observed efficient induction of chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films by mixing with helicene&#8208;type chiral additives based on the dibenzo[c,h]acridine motif. Images obtained from circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) microscopy provide information about the chiral arrangements in the thin films with diffraction&#8208;limited resolution. The CD signal shows a characteristic dependence on the film thickness, which supports a supramolecular origin of the strong chiral response of the copolymer. In particular, we demonstrate the discrimination between films of opposite chirality based on their ultrafast transient chiral response through the use of femtosecond broadband CD spectroscopy and a newly developed setup for transient CPL spectroscopy with 28&#8197;ps time resolution. A systematic variation of the enantiomeric excess of the chiral additive shows that the &#8220;Sergeants and Soldiers&#8221; concept and &#8220;Majority Rules&#8221; are not obeyed.

         <dc:description>Herein, we develop a novel bacteria&#8208;based drug delivery system, termed as the Trojan nanobacteria system, which is made of nanoagents internalized into engineered bacteria through bacteria&#8208;specific maltodextrin&#160;(MD) transporters. Compared with the system of attaching nanoagents to bacterial surfaces, the presented Trojan system features higher payloads and better stability.&#160;In cancer therapy, Trojan nanobacteria can specifically discriminate the tumor region and then penetrate deep tumor tissues. Afterwards, Trojan nanobacteria systems are able to destroy deep tumor tissues, which is due to the synergistic effects of antitumor protein (  e.g.,  tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;) expression and photothermal properties.</dc:description>

These are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications.

         <title>Umpolung AlaB Reagents for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteogenic Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amino acid synthon in the form of boronoalanine (AlaB) suitable for umpolung peptide/protein functionalization is described. It is demonstrated that AlaB can be incorporated into peptides and proteins, and remains stable under solid&#8208;phase synthesis, native chemical ligation, and radical desulfurization. Furthermore, AlaB is a competent partner in inter(intra)molecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids and functionalized peptides are important motifs in modern drug discovery. Here we report that AlaB can serve as universal building blocks in the synthesis of a diverse collection of modified amino acids, peptides, and proteins. First, we develop the synthesis of AlaB from redox&#8208;active esters of aspartic acid resulting in a series of &#946;&#8208;boronoalanine derivatives. Next, we show that AlaB can be integrated into automated oligopeptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis. AlaB is compatible with common transformations used in preparative peptide chemistry such as native chemical ligation and radical desulfurization as showcased by total synthesis of AlaB&#8208;containing ubiquitin. Furthermore, AlaB reagents participate in Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, including C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, AlaB synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Elimination of Chlorine from a Carbene&#8208;Xanthylium Gold(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex combining an ambiphilic carbene/xanthylium ligand and a gold trichloride supports the efficient green&#8208;light&#8208;induced extrusion of chlorine radicals en route to the corresponding gold(I) complex. The photolability of this gold(III) complex originates from excitation of a carbene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad, the excited state of which challenges the inherent stability of the gold(III) moiety.







Abstract
With the discovery of late transition metal platforms that support clean photoreductive halogen eliminations, we now describe an indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene gold trichloride complex ([7]+) decorated at the 4&#8208;position by a xanthylium unit. This orange complex features a low energy band in the visible part of the spectrum, assigned to the charge transfer excitation of the indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad. Green&#8208;light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10&#8201;%. A neutral analog of [7]+ featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium&#8208;based photoredox unit present in [7]+.

Green-light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible-light-induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10&#8201;%. A neutral analog of [&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium-based photoredox unit present in [&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although doubted in the past, two &#960;&#8208;electrons are just enough to stabilize five&#8208;membered aromatic compounds that are even stable at room&#8208;temperature, as shown by the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene. This compound is a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths.







Abstract
Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirm its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol at Close to Theoretical Potential via Engineering Abundant Electron&#8208;Donating Cu&#948;+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Cu2S1&#8722;x hollow nanocubes with abundant and stable Cu&#948;+ species are designedly synthesized and achieve ethanol&#8208;selective electrosynthesis. The abundant Cu&#948;+ sites have electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to liquid multi&#8208;carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu&#948;+ is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu0. Here a Cu2S1&#8722;x catalyst with abundant Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9&#8201;% and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3&#8201;% but also provides a long&#8208;term stability of Cu&#948;+, gaining an economic profit based on techno&#8208;economic analysis. The calculation and in situ spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu&#948;+ sites display electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.

         <title>Bioinspired and Ligand&#8208;Regulated Unnatural Prenylation and Geranylation of Oxindoles with Isoprene under Pd Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy has been developed for the bioinspired and ligand&#8208;regulated chemoselective unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles with isoprene under Pd catalysis. The selectivity was governed by modulating the coordination geometry of the Pd catalyst.







Abstract
In nature, prenylation and geranylation are two important metabolic processes for the creation of hemiterpenoids and monoterpenoids under enzyme catalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated bioinspired unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles using the basic industrial feedstock isoprene through ligand regulation under Pd catalysis. Pentenylated oxindoles (with C5 added) were attained with high selectivity when using a bisphosphine ligand, whereas upon switching to a monophosphine ligand, selectivity toward geranylated oxindoles (with C10 added) was achieved. Moreover, the head&#8208;to&#8208;head product could be further isomerized to an internal skipped diene under Pd&#8722;H catalysis. No stoichiometric by&#8208;product was formed in the process.
