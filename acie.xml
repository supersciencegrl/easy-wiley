      <title>The Network of Replication, Transcription, and Reverse Transcription of a Synthetic Genetic Cassette</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognised and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates  in vivo  by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A 34&#8208;Electron Superatom Ag78 Cluster with Regioselective Ternary Ligands Shells and Its 2D Rhombic Superlattice Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>The coverage of surface ligands has important influence on the formation, structure and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters.  Herein, we report a 78&#8208;nuclei silver nanocluster [Ag  78  (  i  PrPhS)  30  (dppm)  10  Cl  10  ]  4+  (  SD/Ag78a  ; dppm = bis&#8208;(diphenyphosphino)methane) that is synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction using [Ag(pz)]  n  as precursor (Hpz = pyrazole) and further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.  SD/Ag78a  shows a core&#8208;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag  53  kernel surrounded by an Ag  25  discontinuous metal&#8208;organic shell. The Ag  53  kernel is an Ag  13  Inodecahedron encaged by an Ag  40  drum&#8208;like shell, while the Ag  25  shell consists of two Ag  10  S  10  P  10  Cl  5  rings and five S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples. Three types of ligands regioselectively cap on the surface of the Ag  78  nanocluster, forming diverse metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures such as  S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples, Cl&#8208;capped Ag  3  trigons and S&#8208;capped Ag  4  tetragons.  This nanocluster is a closed&#8208;shell 34&#8208;electron superatom with +4 charge state and shows highly featured molecule&#8208;like absorption spectra in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible region with a maximum around 493 nm. The rhombic superlattice assembled from  SD/Ag78a  through intercluster C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions can be formed by a simple drop&#8208;casting treatment. This work not only reveals the complicated surface chemistry of silver nanocluster but also provides a promising ternary ligand strategy for the syntheses of them.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrathin Porous Carbon Nitride Bundles with an Adjustable Energy Band Structure toward Simultaneous Solar Photocatalytic Water Splitting and Selective Phenylcarbinol Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Rational design of photocatalysts with multiple functions, including organic synthesis and water&#8208;splitting, is promising and challenging. Herein, we synthesized actiniae&#8208;like carbon nitride (ACN) bundles based on the pyrolysis of an asymmetric supramolecular precursor prepared from L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) and melamine. ACN has adjustable band gaps (2.25 eV ~ 2.75 eV) and hollow microtubes with ultrathin pore walls, which enrich reaction sites, improve visible&#8208;light absorption and enhance charge separation. In the presence of phenylcarbinol, ACN exhibited excellent pure water&#8208;splitting ability (95.3 &#956;mol/h) and in the meanwhile phenylcarbinol was selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde (conversion of 90.9%, selectivity of 99.7%) under solar irradiation. For the concurrent reactions,  2  D isotope labeling, separation and detection were conducted to confirm that the proton source of released hydrogen is water. Further, we theorized the mechanism of water splitting and phenylcarbinol oxidation and hope that it provides inspiration for simultaneous utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes in one system.</dc:description>

      <title>Inverting the enantiopreference of nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles by reshaping the binding pocket with a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles is an attractive method for the synthesis of chiral cyanocarboxylic acids, the precursors to pharmaceutically important g&#8208;amino acids. However, the tested nitrilases towards 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or aryl substituted glutaronitriles mostly generate ( S  )&#8208;configurated cyanocarboxylic acids. Herein a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy, i.e. symmetry analysis of substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to identify two key amino acid residues W170 and V198 that possibly modulate the enantiopreference of a nitrilase from Synechocystis  sp. PCC6803 towards 3&#8208;isobutyl glutaronitrile ( 1a  ). Exchange of these two residues resulted in the enantiopreference inversion ( S  , 90% ee  to R  , 47% ee  ). By further reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pocket via routine site&#8208;saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis, variant E8 with higher activity and stereoselectivity (99% ee  , R  ) was obtained. The mutant enzyme was applied in the preparation of optically pure ( R  )&#8208;3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyanobutanoic acid (( R  )&#8208; 2a  ), and showed similar stereopreference inversion towards a series of 3&#8208;substituted glutaronitriles. This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other classes of enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups, that are often desirable in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery and Design of Family VIII Carboxylesterases as Highly Efficient Acyltransferases</title>
      <dc:description>Promiscuous acyltransferase activity is the ability of certain hydrolases to preferentially catalyze acyl transfer over hydrolysis, even in bulk water. However, poor enantioselectivity, low transfer efficiency, significant product hydrolysis, and limited substrate scope represent considerable drawbacks for their application. By activity&#8208;based screening of several hydrolases, we identified the family VIII carboxylesterase, EstCE1, as an unprecedentedly efficient acyltransferase.

      <title>Evidence of Highly Anharmonic Soft Lattice Vibrations in Zintl Rattler</title>
      <dc:description>Phonons are collective excitations from a periodic lattice and are the primary carriers of heat in an insulating crystalline solid. The extent of periodicity in a crystalline lattice is ensured by local chemical bonding, thereby, understanding the correlation between local structure and lattice dynamics is crucial in realizing intrinsically low thermal conductivity. Here, we present lattice dynamics associated with the local chemical bonding hierarchy in Zintl compound TlInTe  2  , which cause intriguing phonon excitations and strongly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to an ultralow value (0.46 &#8208; 0.31 W/mK) in the 300&#8208;673 K. We established an intrinsic rattling nature in TlInTe  2  by studying the local structure and phonon vibrations using synchrotron X&#8208;ray Pair Distribution Function (PDF) (100 &#8211; 503 K) and Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) (5 &#8211; 450 K), respectively. We showed that while 1D chain of covalently bonded [InTe2](&#8208;n) (n)&#160; transport heat with Debye type phonon excitation, ionically bonded Tl rattles with a frequency ~30 cm  &#8208;1  inside distorted Thompson cage formed by&#160;[InTe2](&#8208;n) (n) . This highly anharmonic Tl rattling causes strong phonon scattering and consequently phonon lifetime reduces to ultralow value ~0.66(6) ps, which resulted ultralow thermal conductivity in TlInTe  2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Acyl Donor Intermediates in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis: Acyl Azolium or Azolium Enolate?</title>
      <dc:description>Azolium enolates and acyl azolium cations have been proposed as intermediates in numerous N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed transformations. Acetyl azolium enolates were generated from the reaction of 2&#8208;propenyl acetate with both saturated (SIPr) and aromatic (IPr) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, isolated, and characterized by NMR and XRD. Protonation with triflic acid gave the corresponding acetyl azolium triflates which were isolated and characterized (NMR, XRD) as well. Acyl azolium cations have been proposed as immediate precursors of the ester product e.g in the redox esterification of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;enals. Our current studies, involving isotopically labeled  d  3  &#8208;acetyl azolium triflate, suggest that ester formation instead originates from an azolium enolate intermediate. Furthermore, the acetyl azolium enolate was found to selectively react with alcohol nucleophiles in the presence of amines. While the acetyl azolium cation did not react with alcohols, an ester&#8208;selective reaction could be induced by addition of base,  via  intermediate formation of the acetyl azolium enolate.</dc:description>

      <title>Encoding Multilayer Complexity in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Heterometallic MOF&#8208;based Optical Tags</title>
      <dc:description>Optical tags provide a way to quickly and unambiguously identify valuable assets. Current tag fluorophore options lack the tunability to allow combined methods of encoding in a single material. Here we report a design strategy to encode multilayer complexity in a family of heterometallic rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic frameworks based on highly connected nonanuclear clusters. To impart both intricacy and security, a synergistic approach was implemented resulting in both overt (visible) and covert (near infrared, NIR) properties, with concomitant multi&#8208;emissive spectra and tunable luminescence lifetimes. Tag authentication is validated with a variety of orthogonal detection methodologies. Importantly, the effect induced by subtle compositional changes on intermetallic energy transfer, and thus on the resulting photophysical properties, is demonstrated. This strategy can be widely implemented to create a large library of highly complex, difficult to counterfeit optical tags.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bond Donor&#8208;Catalyzed Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of high molecular weight poly(vinyl ethers) under mild conditions is a significant challenge since cationic polymerizations are highly sensitivity to chain transfer and termination events. We identified a novel and highly effective hydrogen bond donor (HBD)&#8208;organic acid pair that can facilitate controlled cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers under ambient conditions with excellent monomer compatibility. Poly(vinyl ethers) of molar masses exceeding 50 kg/mol can be produced within one hour without elaborate reagent purification. Modification of the HBD structure allowed tuning of the polymerization rate while density functional theory (DFT) calculations helped elucidate crucial intermolecular interactions between the HBD, organic acid, and polymer chain end.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphine Carboxylate &#8211; Probing the Edge of Stability of a Carbon Dioxide Adduct with Dihydrogenphosphide</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new adduct of carbon dioxide with dihydrogenphosphide, that may be prepared either by direct reaction of NaPH  2  with carbon dioxide or by hydrolysis of the phosphaethynolate ion (PCO  &#8211;  ).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a new adduct of carbon dioxide with dihydrogenphosphide, that may be prepared either by direct reaction of NaPH  2  with carbon dioxide or by hydrolysis of the phosphaethynolate ion (PCO  &#8211;  ). In this latter transformation, a new mechanism is proposed for the electrophilic reactivity of the phosphaethynolate ion. The resulting anion is shown to be a weak but stable adduct of carbon dioxide, reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal carbon dioxide complexes.

      <title>Spatiotemporal regulation of fluorescence in a urease&#8208;embedded hydrogel for multistage information security</title>

      <title>Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Functionalized with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as Robust and Conductive Ligands to Stabilize Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Due to their excellent stability and conductivity,  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have attracted great attention as versatile ligands for the functionalization of macroscopic gold surfaces.

Using NHCs to link Au NPs and electronically active organic components, e.g. conjugated polymers (CPs), will allow capitalizing on both the stability as well as the inherent conductivity of the NHC anchors. Here, we report three types of Br&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) complexes, which, when used as starting points for Kumada polymerizations, yield regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophenes)&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au (P3HTs&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au) with narrow molecular weight distributions. The corresponding NPs are obtained  via  direct reduction, and show excellent thermal as well as redox stability. The NHC anchors enable electron delocalization over the gold/CP interface, resulting in an improved electrochromic response behavior in comparison with P3HT&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au. This work demonstrates for the first time that CPs functionalized with NHCs can serve as ligands for the stabilization of Au NPs, paving a way for potential (opto&#8208;)electronical applications of CP&#8208;NHC@Au NP nanomaterials.</dc:description>

      <title>Pairwise Proximity&#8208;differentiated Visualization of Single&#8208;cell DNA Epigenetic Marks</title>
      <dc:description>Spatial positioning and proximity of DNA epigenetic marks are fundamental to a deeper understanding of gene regulation and chromatin architecture. However, it remains poorly explored and technically challenging. Here we report pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated visualization of single&#8208;cell 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). These two marks on chromatin in fixed cells are successively labeled and crosslinked with their DNA primer probes via click chemistry. Based on a pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated mechanism, proximal 5fC/5hmC sites firstly and residual 5fC or 5hmC sites then are encoded with respective circularized barcodes. These barcodes are simultaneously amplified for multiplexed single&#8208;molecule imaging. Thus we demonstrate differentiated visualization of 5fC or 5hmC spatial positioning and their pairwise proximity in single cells. Such multi&#8208;level subcellular information may provide insights into regulation functions and mechanisms of chromatin modifications, and the spatial proximity can expose the potential crosstalk or interaction between their reader proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>&#8220;Compact&#8221; Sulfate Radical&#8208;Mediated Site&#8208;Selective Alkenylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>A broad variety of unactivated acyclic and alicyclic substrates cleanly undergo site&#8208;selective alkenylation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds with 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethene in the presence of persulfate. This simple transformation furnishes (E)&#8208;2&#8208;alkylvinylphenylsulfones in up to 88% isolated yield. In contrast with the previously reported decatungstate protocol, the current method is applicable to alkenylation of sterically hindered C&#8208;H bonds. This important advantage significantly broadens the substrate scope, and is attributed to the compact size of the sulfate radical employed in the C&#8208;H activation and cleavage.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A broad variety of unactivated acyclic and alicyclic substrates cleanly undergo site&#8208;selective alkenylation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds with 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethene in the presence of persulfate. This simple transformation furnishes (E)&#8208;2&#8208;alkylvinylphenylsulfones in up to 88% isolated yield. In contrast with the previously reported decatungstate protocol, the current method is applicable to alkenylation of sterically hindered C&#8208;H bonds. This important advantage significantly broadens the substrate scope, and is attributed to the compact size of the sulfate radical employed in the C&#8208;H activation and cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Prebiotically plausible RNA activation compatible with ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed ligation</title>
      <dc:description>RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation is widely believed to be a key reaction for primordial biology. However, since typical chemical routes towards activating RNA substrates are incompatible with ribozyme catalysis, it remains unclear how prebiotic systems generated and sustained pools of activated building blocks needed to form increasingly larger and complex RNA.

      <title>Atomic&#8208;level modulation of electronic density of metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;derived Co single&#8208;atom sites to enhance oxygen reduction performance</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom active sites via engineering atomic configuration is an effective strategy to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but still remains challenging because of the lack of rational guidance and effective methods. Here, we demonstrate the correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and ORR performance by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis. Guided by DFT calculations, we designed and synthesized a MOFs&#8208;derived Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with the optimal Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS active moiety incorporated in hollow carbon polyhedron (Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC). As predicted, Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920 V and superior ORR kinetics with record&#8208;level kinetic current and ultralow Tafel slope of 31 mV dec &#8208;1  , exceeding the Pt/C and almost all non&#8208;precious ORR electrocatalysts. Even in more challenging acidic media, the ORR kinetics of Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC still surpasses that of Pt/C. This work offers an atomic&#8208;level insight into the relationship between electronic density of active site and catalytic property, promoting rational design of highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Bunsen the Geochemist: Icelandic Volcanism, Geyser Theory, and Gas, Rock and Mineral Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Bunsen classified volcanic rocks in two types, trachytic and pyroxenic (today felsic and mafic) based on their chemical analyses. He explained the mechanism of geyser action. He refuted the widespread idea that volcanoes and geysers were connected with the sea, and that masses of common salt were produced in eruptions. He pioneered gas analysis by means of the eudiometer. He was a vehement inductive empiricist, vigorously rejecting hypotheses.







Abstract
Following the eruption of Hekla in 1845&#8211;1846 Bunsen was invited by King Christian VIII of Denmark and Iceland to participate in a geochemical expedition to Iceland together with the geologist Sartorius von Waltershausen and the physiologist Carl Bergmann from G&#246;ttingen. The French mineralogist Des Cloizeaux went to Iceland separately and joined the expedition. The eudiometer invented by Bunsen was crucial for his accurate characterization of volcanic gases and determination of the composition of mixtures. His analyses of the chemical compositions of numerous rocks and minerals led him to the classification of two fundamental rock types, the more silica rich (nowadays called felsic) and the less silica rich, more basic (mafic) in agreement with Des Cloizeaux and the Danish scientist J.&#8197;C. Schythe. Bunsen also formulated the correct mechanism of geyser action and helped disband the theory of connections between geysers, volcanoes and the sea. He disagreed vehemently with Waltershausen over the mechanisms of formation of sal ammoniac and of volcanic rocks and their chemical compositions. He revealed himself as an ardent experimentalist vigorously opposed to hypotheses of any kind, which also made him dismiss the new chemical theories, for example, those of Dumas and Kekul&#233;.

      <title>Synthesis of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of lipopolysaccharide derived from virulent E. coli O1 and identification of a glycotope candidate of avian pathogenetic E. coli O1</title>
      <dc:description>Avian pathogenic  Escherichia coli  (APEC) is a common bacterial pathogen infecting chickens, resulting in economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. In particular, APEC O1, one of the most common serotypes of APEC, is considered problematic due to its zoonotic potential. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop an effective vaccine against APEC O1. In fact, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O&#8208;antigen of APEC O1 has been shown to be a potent antigen for inducing specific protective immune responses. However, the detailed structure of the O&#8208;antigen of APEC O1 is not clear. The present study demonstrates the first synthesis of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of LPS, &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;Man  p  NAc&#8208;(1,2)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;  l  &#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1,3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;  l  &#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1,3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;  l  &#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1,4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;Glc  p  NAc, derived from virulent  E. coli  O1 and its conjugate with BSA. ELISA tests revealed that the semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate effectively binds to antibodies in the chicken serum, which were obtained after immunization with APEC O1, competitively with LPS of APEC O1. These results indicate that the pentasaccharide is a glycotope candidate of APEC O1, with great potential as an antigen for vaccine development.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting the Energy Density of Aqueous Batteries via Facile Grotthuss Proton Transport</title>
      <dc:description>The recent developments in rechargeable aqueous batteries have witnessed a burgeoning interest in the mechanism of proton transport in the cathode materials. Herein, for the first time, we report the Grotthuss proton transport mechanism in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  which features wide [2&#215;2] tunnels. Exemplified by the substitution doping of Ni (~5 at.%) in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  that increases the energy density of the electrode by ~25%, we reveal a close link between the tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic (TO) distortion of the lattice and the diffusion kinetics of protons in the tunnels. Experimental and theoretical results verify that Ni dopants can exacerbate the TO distortion during discharge, thereby facilitating the hydrogen bond formation in bulk &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  . The isolated direct hopping mode of proton transport is switched to a facile concerted mode, which involves the formation and concomitant cleavage of O&#8208;H bonds in a proton array, namely via Grotthuss proton transport mechanism. Our study provides important insight towards the understanding of proton transport in MnO  2  and can serve as a model for the compositional design of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

Exemplified by the substitution doping of Ni (~5 at.%) in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  that increases the energy density of the electrode by ~25%, we reveal a close link between the tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic (TO) distortion of the lattice and the diffusion kinetics of protons in the tunnels. Experimental and theoretical results verify that Ni dopants can exacerbate the TO distortion during discharge, thereby facilitating the hydrogen bond formation in bulk &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  . The isolated direct hopping mode of proton transport is switched to a facile concerted mode, which involves the formation and concomitant cleavage of O&#8208;H bonds in a proton array, namely via Grotthuss proton transport mechanism. Our study provides important insight towards the understanding of proton transport in MnO  2  and can serve as a model for the compositional design of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Effect of Particle Wettability and Particle Concentration on the Enzymatic Dehydration of n&#8208;Octanaloxime in Pickering Emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsion systems have emerged as platforms for the synthesis of organic molecules in biphasic biocatalysis. Herein, the catalytic performance was evaluated for biotransformation using whole cells exemplified for the dehydration of  n  &#8208;octanaloxime to  n  &#8208;octanenitrile catalysed by an aldoxime dehydratase (OxdB) overexpressed in  E. coli  . This study was carried out in Pickering emulsions stabilised solely with silica particles of different hydrophobicity. We correlate, for the first time, the properties of the emulsions with the conversion of the reaction, thus gaining an insight into the impact of the particle wettability and particle concentration. When comparing two emulsions of different type with similar stability and droplet diameter, the oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (o/w) system displayed a higher conversion than the water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (w/o) system, despite the conversion in both cases being higher than that in a &#8220;classic&#8221; two&#8208;phase system. Furthermore, an increase in particle concentration prior to emulsification resulted in an increase of the interfacial area and hence a higher conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Ultra&#8208;Large Optical Asymmetry in Amorphous Molecular Aggregations</title>
      <dc:description>Although ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry appears in crystalline materials, distractions from the mesoscopic ordering often causes inauthenticity in chiropticity. In addition, the formation and maintenance of crystalline states require complicated technical efforts. In amorphous materials, however, it remained challenging and elusive to achieve large chiropticity, not to mention the control of the degree of asymmetry. Herein, we report the quantitative control of chiral amplification, on amorphous supramolecular structures of cholesteryl&#8208;linked bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II), to an exceptionally high level. The amorphous molecular aggregations of these complex building blocks exhibit mirror&#8208;image chiropticity. A proper chiral packing of the building block at several molecular scale contributes considerably to the absorptive dissymmetry factor g  abs  , although the system is overall disordered. The intense and tunable aggregation strength renders a variable g  abs  value up to +0.10 and +0.31 in the solution and in film state, higher than those observed in most previously reported cases. On this basis, a superior ON&#8208;OFF switching of chiropticity is realized under external stimuli. By eliminating the demand on material crystallinity, this work establishes a general design principle to control over ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry on a wider scope of chiral materials.</dc:description>

To improve in vivo detection of biomarkers, chemiluminophores that simultaneously possess near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and modular structures amenable to construction of activatable probes are highly desired, which however are rare.

Caging of the chemiluminophores with different cleavable moieties leads to NIR chemiluminescence probes (NCP  S  ) that only activate signals upon reaction with reactive oxygen species or enzymes with the tissue&#8208;penetration depth up to 2 cm. Particularly, NCP  Sg  can trigger its chemiluminescence at 760 nm for sensitive detection of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (a cancer biomarker), allowing to image and differentiate the expression levels of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase in different cancer cells in living mouse.

      <title>Sublimable Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes: From Spin&#8208;State Switching to Molecular Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
This review provides a complete account of the on&#8208;surface spin&#8208;state switching behavior of films of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes of molecular to multilayer thickness. SCO&#8208;based molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures fabricated employing vacuum sublimation are also described.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) active transition metal complexes are an important class of switchable molecular materials due to their bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics at or around room temperature. Vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes are a subclass of SCO complexes suitable for fabricating ultraclean spin&#8208;switchable films desirable for applications, especially in molecular electronics/spintronics. Consequently, on&#8208;surface SCO of thin&#8208;films of sublimable SCO complexes have been studied employing spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and results of fundamental and technological importance have been obtained. This Review provides complete coverage of advances made in the field of vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes: progress made in the design and synthesis of sublimable functional SCO complexes, on&#8208;surface SCO of molecular and multilayer thick films, and various molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures based on the sublimable SCO complexes.

      <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis Induced by Platinum(II) Tweezers with Excellent Environmental Tolerance</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular chirogenesis has emerged as an effective strategy to access symmetry breaking in artificial systems. However, the chirogenic signals suffer from high susceptibility toward environmental variations, which are disadvantageous for their applications in asymmetric catalysis, chiroptical devices etc. Herein an effective strategy has been developed to address this issue, by constructing non&#8208;covalent tweezer/guest complexes stabilized by two&#8208;fold donor&#8211;acceptor and Pt(II)&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Pt(II) metal&#8211;metal interactions. Upon guest encapsulation, the two pincers on achiral Pt(II) tweezer undergo stereospecific twist to minimize steric repulsion, thus locking the tweezer/guest complexes into preferred chiral conformations. The induced chiroptical effects display outstanding solvent&#8208; and temperature&#8208; tolerance, ascribed to strong tweezer/guest binding strength via the balance between electrostatic and desolvation effects for the involved non&#8208;covalent interactions. Moreover, hierarchical and multi&#8208;component supramolecular assembly of tweezer/guest complexes provide a convenient way to modulate chirogeneic signals for their intensities. Overall, the current study opens up new avenues toward artificial supramolecular chirogenesis with excellent environmental tolerability.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals&#8212;A Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8197;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>
For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principals. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters.

Abstract
For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.

&lt;p&gt;For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principals. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters. The technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction, as well as the use of ionic liquids.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Construction of MOF@COF Nanozyme with Active Sites in Tailored Microenvironment and Pseudopodia&#8208;like Surface for Enhanced Bacterial Inhibition</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have sparked increasing interest in mimicking the structure and function of natural enzymes. However, their catalytic and therapeutic efficiency are unsatisfactory due to the relatively lower catalytic activity. Herein, inspired by nature, a MOF@COF nanozyme has been designed as a high&#8208;efficiency peroxidase mimic, with the metallic nodes of MOFs as active centres, the hierarchical nanocavities produced by the growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as binding pockets to form tailored pore microenvironment around active sites for enriching and activating substrate molecules, to perform enhanced bacterial inhibition. Furthermore, the pseudopodia&#8208;like surface of the COFs &#8220;skin&#8221; enabled the system to catch the bacteria effectively for further amplifying the therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozyme. We believe that the present study will not only facilitate the design of novel nanozymes, but also broaden the biological usage of MOF/COF&#8208;based hybrid materials.</dc:description>

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed oxidative kinetic resolution of cyclic benzylic ethers through asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation is reported. The practical approach is applicable to a wide range of 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans bearing diverse functional groups and substituent patterns at the &#945;&#8197;position with extremely efficient enantiodiscrimination. The generality of the strategy was further demonstrated by efficient oxidative kinetic resolution of another type of five&#8208;membered cyclic benzylic ether, 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans, and six&#8208;membered 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes. Direct late&#8208;stage oxidative kinetic resolution of bioactive molecules that are otherwise difficult to access was further explored.

      <title>Reversing Titanium Oligomers Formation towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Green Synthesis of Titanium&#8208;containing Molecular Sieves</title>

This approach successfully reverses the Ti oligomers formation to match hydrolysis rates of Ti and Si species with the assistance of hydroxyl free radicals generated  in&#8208;situ  from ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, fantastic catalytic performance for propene epoxidation with H  2  and O  2  is observed.

      <dc:description>Locking&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids into targeted architectures by the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles, i.e. structuring liquids, is an emerging area in material science. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) shows three different aggregation states that present an absorption imaging platform to monitor the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at the liquid/liquid interface. The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2&#8208; dissolved in water, from a J to an H&#8208;aggregation state was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine terminated polystyrene (PS&#8208;NH2) dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color&#8208;tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the nanoparticulate surfactants formed between H4TPPS2&#8208; and PS&#8208;NH2. However, the nanoparticulate surfactants formed cannot lock&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via 1,4&#8208;Boron Migration</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we demonstrate a novel one&#8208;pot synthetic method towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs,  1a  &#8208;  1o  ), including hitherto unknown B&#8208;doped zethrene derivatives, from  ortho  &#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes with high atom efficiency and broad substrate scopes.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate a novel one&#8208;pot synthetic method towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs,  1a  &#8208;  1o  ), including hitherto unknown B&#8208;doped zethrene derivatives, from  ortho  &#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes with high atom efficiency and broad substrate scopes. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental investigation together with the theoretical calculations, which involves a unique 1,4&#8208;boron migration process.

      <title>Backbone&#8208;Bridging Promotes Diversity in Heteroleptic Cages</title>
      <dc:description>The combination of shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands  L  A  and  L  B  with Pd(II) cations yields heteroleptic cages  cis  &#8208;[Pd  2  L  A  2  L  B  2  ] by non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly. Here we report how such assemblies can be diversified by introduction of covalent backbone bridges between two  L  A  units. Together with solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;effects, the flexibility of these linkers is shown to modulate the nuclearity, topology and number of distinguishable cavities in a family of four structurally highly diverse supramolecular assemblies. Ligand&#8208;dimer  L  A1  , with flexibly connected backbones, reacts in acetonitrile with its  L  B  counterpart to a tetranuclear back&#8208;to&#8208;back dimer of heteroleptic cages  D1  . In DMSO, however, a trinuclear pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral structure  T1  is formed. The product of  L  A2  , with rigidly connected backbones, looks similar to  D1  , but with a rotated ligand arrangement. In presence of an anionic guest, this dimer  D2  transforms and a hexanuclear prismatic barrel  P2  crystallizes. We demonstrate how controlling a ligand&#8217;s coordination mode can trigger structural differentiation and increase complexity in metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

      <title>Combining Titanium&#8208;Organic Cage and Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Cage for Highly Effective Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <dc:description>Although many metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and a few hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic cages (HOCs) have been individually investigated, little is reported about the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of MOCs and HOCs. Herein, we first describe an unprecedented MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal, which is composed of tetrahedral Ti4L6 (L = embonate) cages and in&#8208;situ generated [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] (TIPA = tris(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine) cages. Chiral transfer phenomenon is observed from enantiopure Ti4L6 cage to enantiopure [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] cage. Accordingly, two homochiral supramolecular frameworks with opposite handedness (PTC&#8208;235(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;235(&#923;)) are formed. Such MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal features high stability in water and other solvents, affording single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to trap CH3CN molecules and identify disordered NH4+ cations. Moreover, a tablet pressing method is firstly developed to test the third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property of KBr&#8208;based PTC&#8208;235 thin film. Attributing to the abundant &#960;&#8208;&#960; accumulation between two different tetrahedral cages, such thin film exhibits excellent optical limiting effect. This work not only presents an extraordinary MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal assembly, but also provides a new insight on the function of cage materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Insertion of Metal&#8208;substituted Silylene into Naphthalene's Aromatic Ring and Subsequent Rearrangement for Silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl and Cyclobutenosilaindan Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of silacycle compounds are of fundamental and application importance. Herein we report the first example of insertion of metal&#8208;substituted silylene fragment into naphthalene's aromatic ring. More significantly, this insertion is followed by interesting rearrangements to yield silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl and cyclobutenosilaindan derivatives. The formation of cyclobutenosilaindan derivative includes the C&#8208;C bond cleavage and 4&#960;&#160;electrocyclization steps; the formation of silaspiro&#8208;benzo&#8208;cycloheptenyl derivative is more complicated, including the C&#8208;C bond cleavage, reversible 4&#960;&#160;electrocyclization, C&#8208;H bond activation and C&#8208;Si bond cleavage. DFT investigations were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic aspects of these two rearrangements. The formed cyclobutenosilaindan potassium can readily react with PhOH, MeOTf, EtOTf, PhCH  2  Cl or PhCOCl at room temperature&#160;to afford the hydrogen, alkyl, benzyl or benzoyl substituted cyclobutenosilaindans in high yields.</dc:description>

The formation of cyclobutenosilaindan derivative includes the C&#8208;C bond cleavage and 4&#960;&#160;electrocyclization steps; the formation of silaspiro&#8208;benzo&#8208;cycloheptenyl derivative is more complicated, including the C&#8208;C bond cleavage, reversible 4&#960;&#160;electrocyclization, C&#8208;H bond activation and C&#8208;Si bond cleavage. DFT investigations were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic aspects of these two rearrangements. The formed cyclobutenosilaindan potassium can readily react with PhOH, MeOTf, EtOTf, PhCH  2  Cl or PhCOCl at room temperature&#160;to afford the hydrogen, alkyl, benzyl or benzoyl substituted cyclobutenosilaindans in high yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>autodE: Automated Calculation of Reaction Energy Profiles &#8211; Application to Organic and Organometallic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Calculating reaction energy profiles to aid in mechanistic elucidation has long been the domain of the expert computational chemist. Here, we introduce autodE (https://github.com/duartegroup/autodE), an open&#8208;source Python package capable of locating transition states and minima and delivering a full reaction energy profile from 1D or 2D chemical representations. autodE is broadly applicable to study organic and organometallic reaction classes, including addition, substitution, elimination, migratory insertion, oxidative addition and reductive elimination; it accounts for conformational sampling of both minima and TSs, and is compatible with many electronic structure packages. The general applicability of autodE is demonstrated in complex multi&#8208;step reactions, including metal&#8208;catalyzed cobalt&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation, and an Ireland&#8208;Claisen rearrangement.</dc:description>

      <title>Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalytic Systems for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Where Are We Now?</title>
      <dc:description>
Mimicking natural photosynthesis: The latest progress on Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is comprehensively discussed in this Review. Particular attention is given to modification strategies that improve photocatalytic performance as well as confirmation methods to assess the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Transforming CO2 into fuels by utilizing sunlight is promising to synchronously overcome global warming and energy&#8208;supply issues. It is crucial to design efficient photocatalysts with intriguing features such as robust light&#8208;harvesting ability, strong redox potential, high charge&#8208;separation, and excellent durability. Hitherto, a single&#8208;component photocatalyst is incapable to simultaneously meet all these criteria. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing artificial Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts provides a facile way to conquer these bottlenecks. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and Z&#8208;scheme systems. Thereafter we discuss state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic CO2 reduction, whereby special attention is placed on the predominant factors that affect photoactivity. Additionally, further modifications that are important for efficient photocatalysis are reviewed.

      <title>Inhibiting Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation in Graphite Anode by Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as the leading contenders in energy storage devices. However, the batteries with routine carbonate electrolytes cannot exhibit satisfactory fast&#8208;charging performance and lithium plating is widely observed at low temperatures. Herein we demonstrate that a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte consisting of 1.5 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in dimethoxyethane with bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) ether as the diluent, enables fast&#8208;charging of working batteries. A uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be achieved on graphite surface through the preferential decomposition of anions. The established SEI can significantly inhibit solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite and achieve highly reversible Li+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. The graphite | Li cells exhibit fast&#8208;charging potential (340 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 220 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 C), excellent cycling stability (~85.5% initial capacity retention for 200 cycles at 4 C), and impressive low temperature performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Next Generation of Zinc Bisguanidine Polymerization Catalysts towards Highly Crystalline, Biodegradable Polyesters</title>
      <dc:description>
Many bioplastics are produced by metal&#8208;catalyzed ring opening polymerization. For a truly sustainable lifecycle the industrially used cytotoxic catalyst tin(II)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylhexanoate must be replaced by non&#8208;toxic alternatives. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008473), S. Herres&#8208;Pawlis, L. Hartmann et&#8197;al. report the fastest known robust catalyst in the polymerization of lactide (LA) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL). This zinc guanidine catalyst polymerizes technical LA and CL in the melt with high rate constants and molar masses, leading to colorless, transparent polymer.

      <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Alcohols by Enantioselective Silylation Enabled by Two Orthogonal Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral copper catalyst and a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex enables the nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols. The enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling and the rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization are perfectly orthogonal. By this, high yields and good levels of enantioselection are achieved.







Abstract
A nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols is reported. The approach merges rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization and enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling of alcohols and hydrosilanes. The catalytic processes are orthogonal, and the racemization catalyst does not promote any background reactions such as the racemization of the silyl ether and its unselective formation. Often&#8208;used ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes are not suitable but a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex perfectly fulfills this purpose. By this, enantioselective silylation of racemic alcohol mixtures is achieved in high yields and with good levels of enantioselection.
